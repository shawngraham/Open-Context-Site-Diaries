We measured our 5x5 on the side of the hill. There are only a few prickly weeds were in this section. The work men are digging them out. I am working with Lokman and Ercan. We are removing some top soil. We started at the southeast corner to remove topsoil. Then we hit upon some hard packed soil only about 8cm below the surface. It is flat and follows the plane of the slope. We only had to dig about 2cm on the downhill side. It is more of a crumbly dried mud surface. They are sweeping it. On the southeast corner we seem to have dug into it without initial problem. There are trees growing out of it, roots. This second surface is locus 1001, the topsoil is 1000.   After Carpus for breakfast, we started to dig the southeast corner of 1001. The dry crumbly dirt came apart pretty easy. We dug a quarter of the trench and looked for finds. We found a piece of basalt bowl, kt 1006 in this southeast quarter. And there were some interesting pottery rims.   Once we broke the top of 1001, the top pieces were held together tight so we had to break them up to search for sherds. But under there was more dirt until another solidish surface. We will clear to there to determine if it is a new locus. We got through some of the dirt to another crumbly white surface. In the southeast corner were some small smashed pieces of pottery. We found a snail shell and a funny rock shaped like a nail. We will probably crush through this level.   Tomorrow, I think we should continue digging the corner so we can find a section on the other parts of the trench.           ,~: C-1-2000-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1000,"3,2000-07-21," B-2-2000-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   July 21, 2000      Laid out trench, swept perimeter. the elevation was taken as the average between the highest and lowest points. we started digging locus 2000 in the southern half of the trench. we dug roughly 10cm through the topsoil, which was dry and clumpy. we found many, many pot sherds in this section and one bone fragment. a possible lithic was put in the pottery bag to be washed.      roughly 10 cm down, we hit a harder packed surface, sloping downhill to the west and lighter in color than the topsoil. this extended across the entire southern half of the trench. we didn't open this as a new locus because we had to finish digging the northern half of locus 2000.      the northern half was similar to the southern half except that it was rockier and only about 5cm thick from the surface to the layer of harder packed soil below, which was contiguous with the layer on the southern side. we found many more sherds here, and also a larger bone fragment. we did not entirely finish excavating this section of locus 2000, and so will continue tomorrow before opening locus 2001.      surface find consisting of a large fragment of a stone pot was located 86 cm east and 193 cm north of the southeast corner of the trench. both measurements were taken from the 5 meter trench line, not the 4 meterbalk wall. as the fragment was found outside the trench, it was not given a kt number. the work day ended before an elevation could be taken. it will be taken tomorrow.                    ,~: B-2-2000-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2000,"4,2000-07-21," A-1-2000-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1000,","   July 21, 2000      Set up 5 x 5 meter unit with 50 cm bulk. Removed top soil using pick and shovel. Leveled the surface. Started at East half of the unit and dug until 15 cm from surface on south side, 25 cm from surface on north. At this point a new surface (new locus) was exposed. Found loose soil on east wall, but at this point we don't know what . . . possibly a pit? made new KT number for pottery and lithics in west half of unit, but kept same KT number for bone throughout the enitre locus. Found some possible mud bricks, but they might just be compacted mud because they were randomly dispersed, not in order (disturbed). The actual topsoil was about 5 cm, but there was no reason to change the locus and kept excavating until it was uniform depth with east half. Found several flat sherds concentrated on northwest corner of the unit. Possibly reached a surface. We assigned a new KT number for this area's pottery. (KT 1007).

We dug 10 cm into Locus 1000 an area roughly one third of the square, finding a few bones and some pottery, but no lithics. The topsoil was dark tightly packed soil, with weeds on top.    We let the workers dig about 10 cm too far and too fast. We did not detect the change in soil color until the workmen had cleared the full third of the trench. When they began to dig the rest of the square we found a layer of hard packed, grey clay (which we first believed to be mudbrick), this we named Locus 1001. We spent a few hours clearing the rubble from the trench and scraping the thin dark top soil off the clay layer.   By the end of the day we began clearing the hard packed clay and at the same time trying to level the square. We managed to clean and \level\ 2/3 of the trench, finding numerous pottery sherds in the process.   Due to the chaos of the day we were only able to take one elevation at the beginning of the first locus. We have the opportunity to catch up on elevations tomorrow as the levels have not changed significantly.                                   ,~: B-1-2000-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1000,"6,2000-07-21," C-2-2000-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   July 21, 2000      Workers: Jenghis and Meki. We laid out the grid for the trench and began digging to a depth of 10cm. The soil was loose in composition with a mixed context of pottery. We guessed that most of this pottery is Hellenistic. At 10:30 we found a loomweight. At 10:51 we found a chert core. By lunch time we had two-thirds of the trench dug to a depth of 10cm.        ,~: C-2-2000-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2000,"7,2000-07-22," B-2-2000-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   July 22, 2000      Stone pottery surface find is at elevation zero (2.57) according to the line leveling method which was changed to stadia rod measurements today. Elevations taken on 7/21 were adjusted and recorded in the notebook according to the stadia rod measurements.      Potsherds were ecenly distributed throughout the loci and most pieces were 1.5 cm thick. We dug 10 cm on the southern side in soil which was densley packed mud wash. This continued so we began digging the eastern side of the trench in an attempt to level it. We swept things clean and no new locus appeared so we dug another 15 cm.      After digging these 15 cm we encountered a large body sherd .5 m SW from the NE corner. We searched for more fragments, but didn_Ñét find anything else. Later as we were cleaning and straightening the balk wall in this area we found a pot smash which this earlier sherd seemede to fit. We estimate the pot was 10 cm below the previous sherd. We are working on cleaning the area and leveling it for photographing tomorrow. The pot is 19 cm off the E wall and 47 cm off the N wall. A rough size estimate of the debris field which is colsely articulated is 32 cm wide and 34 cm long. When it is more fully unearthed tomorrow we will get more specific meaurements.      Also midway along the E wall were large stones which appeared to be cut and were at the same level as the pot. We will look for a possible suface tomorrow in this area and 2-4 cm below the pot and rocks.     ,~: B-2-2000-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2000,"8,2000-07-22," A-1-2000-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1000,","   July 22, 2000      Finished the NW corner of Locus 1000; cleaned the surface and took a photo. Measured the elevation of the original surface and the final surface of Locus 1000. Measured small finds and took elevations for them. Drew a plan view. East side of the unit was mainly loose sand; west side was compacted sand and silt. We therefore decided to divide the trench into two Locii. East side was assigned Locus # 1001 (loose soil). West side assigned Locus #1002 (compacted layer).       Locus 1001 was thought to contain several pits, but decided to excavate through and see if definite shapes would emerge. Found an obsidian fragment at the center of the trench (KT 1015). Picked up the bone in the northeast corner and assigned it KT# 1016. We leveled the locus at 40 cm below the original surface. After exposing the surface, it was obvious that the loose soil had been created by animal activity. This completed Locus 1001.      After determining that there were no pits in Locus 1001, we decided to excavate Locus 1002 (Western portion) and level it with the completed 1001. Picked up the concentration of small pottery as a small find (KT 1019). Used pick and shovel to take down the rest of Locus 1002. The northwest corner revealed a row of straight mud bricks. Looks to be a wall.           ,~: A-1-2000-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1000,"9,2000-07-22," C-2-2000-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   July 22, 2000      began by cleaning trench. we will continue to excavate L2000 (topsoil layer). We will open a new locus L2001 (though the soil color and texture appears to be the same), knowing that we have removed the topsoil.   At 8 am we opened L2001. It appears to be the same as L2000. Looking at the stratigraphy there is a definite topsoil layer only 4 cm deep. Everything below that at our current depth of 34 cm (at the east wall baulk) appears to be one stratigraphic layer. The top of L2001 appears to be a mudslide with pockets of loose soil impinging a majority of tightly packed a majority of tightly packed soil (ie the mudslide). The loose soil might be caused by rodent burrowing, but more likely is caused by tree roots. Just below the surface of the trench one can see 6 or 7 small tree stumps.   At 47 cm below the surface, we have uncovered a small rock alignment made up of 2 large stones. White pebbles of plaster (perhaps) are found in the immediate area (about 0.5 meter radius).   We began digging L2002 at 10:25. L2002 appears to be the same as 2001, except for a rock alignment which is made up of 2 river stones about 20 cm in diameter at our present height. These lie atop packed dirt. We have yet to see the extent of this wall by the time we closed for the day. We will start tomorrow by excavating around the wall to find it_Ñés extent.        ,~: C-2-2000-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2000,"10,2000-07-23," C-1-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1002,","   July 23, 2000      We have the pot smash in the middle of the East side and the rock garden in the middle of the South side. We started the day by dropping the area between the rock garden and the pot smash. And also taking out the crumbly topsoil on the North half. There are a few more pieces of pottery around the smash. There is a larger piece 1/4 of the way from the west on the North bulk. It is buried deep and has a wavy side. We found some bone on the North side.   We took a photo of the East smash. Then we sent our workmen working on leveling the West side of the trench. We want to end up with a flat surface on the downhill (West side) that we can clean. There continued to be large pieces of pottery strewn about our trench. We just found a large piece on the west side. We will create a step trench. The rock garden which Elvan is clearing appears to extend North. The funny thing is we find few rocks directly East. There are a lot of medium size rocks around the big rocks. To me that says the rocks were placed there on purpose.   The solid in the downhill (NW) side is beginning to be a little less packed. Some different coloration on the deepest part near the middle of the entire trench on the uphill side of our flat trench. On the North wall there are some large pieces of pottery we have kept in place. I will open 1003 on the rock garden because there are so many rocks around. Just West of the rock garden are a lot of small sherds and stones.   We started to go towards the middle and there were some more large sherds and some rocks, and we removed the big rock in the middle. We got a nice level surface down at the bottom. Then we started towards the rock garden. First we wanted to level from the Southwest corner along the wall to the rock garden. There were some nice rims so we opened KT 1029. We will go until I think it was a new locus (1003), the rock garden. Also we leveled the center to the higher step. The trench is on two level steps. In the southeast corner between the rock garden and the pottery smash is very long and has a nice complete rim, which may connect the two. It seems a nice pot and I want to dig it up.        ,~: C-1-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1002,"11,2000-07-23," A-1-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1002,","         July 23, 2000       Since David was sick, I had to do all my work by myself, so if things start to make no sense, this is the day that all begin. Anyway, I started out by cleaning the surface of both Locus 1001 &amp; 1002. Exposed the possible mud-brick wall, but it was cut off near the west wall (Possible two mud-brick in line). There were several large rocks in locus 1002, and seemed to be in line, from N-S, near the North wall. (However, there were no large rocks in locus 1001). Elevation of these rocks and mud bricks were between margin of 2-3 cm difference.     After finishing lcus 1001 and 1002, I decided to divide the trench into 4 corner. East side (2m x 4m) as locus 1003, SW (2m x 2m) as 1006, and NW (2m x 2m) as 1004. We did not excavate 1004 and 1006 today. Locus 1003 was excavated by using pick and shovels and approx 15 cm of soil was removed. There wa a flat lying rocks below 1003, this might be a wall, or possible cover for coffin. After cleaning the surface, possible pit, lined by (possible) Mud-brick was found. This pit was directly below the possible pit in locus 1001 (check KT 1016) Assigned locus 1005 for this possible burial.     I tried to follow the wall of the pit to excavate the pit, on East side of the pit, the soil was more loose and easy to define, but the soil of west side was not clearly distinguishable from the wall of the pit. Within this pit, We found several pieces of bones, animal and possible human, and pottery was scattered throughout the pit. This indicate that if this was a burial, it has been disturbed; or, I have not dig down deep enough. We screened approx 80 % of the soil to see what's in the burial.         ,~: A-1-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1002,"12,2000-07-23," C-2-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,","   July 23, 2000   We began by cleaning the trench. We plan to continue excavating L2001 which appears to be a packed mudslide layer. We will also continue excavation of L2002 which we believe contains a wall. One change we plan to make is to contract L2002 so that it contains just the area where we believe the wall is. After digging down about 4 cm in L2001 a scatter of animal bones was found in the southwest corner of the trench. We believe this to be a pit and have designated it L2003. The pit is characterized by loose and darker soil than the surrounding soil. The bones are associated with a small root system in the far southwest corner of the trench.   After excavating L2001 about 10 cm below L2002 (rock alignment and packed soil) we uncovered a fairly symmetrical \platform\ or mudbrick fall. After consultation with Bradley we divided the trench on its north/south axis. We closed L2001 and opened L2004 and L2005 which lie directly beneath L2001. L2004 is the western portion of the trench and L2005 is the eastern portion. We did this so as to not contaminate the \mudbrick fall\ with any other artifacts.   After a section was taken from L2002 (called L2006) Bradley sprayed the baulks, to see any existing mudbrick lines. Nothing definite was found. Our strategy for tomorrow will be to cut the top off of L2002 in order to determine the nature of this deposition. We will also lower L2005 by 10-15 cm to further expose L2002.     ,~: C-2-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,"13,2000-07-23," B-1-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1003,","   7/23/2000   We began to expand the deep part of locus 1004, (KT#1013-1017) so it would fill one half of the trench (2x4m). Seeing no change within the soil, we continued to expand the deep area into the other half of the trench. All hope seemed to be lost, when one the workmen (Asiz) uncovered a series of rocks running from the South baulk towards the West baulk. It became clear to us that this most likely some sort of foundation and we decided to label it as locus 1005 (KT# 1018-1019)( JPP named the wall-foundations \Asiz_Ñés Wall\ ). The small area between the wall and the SW-corner became locus 1006 (KT# 1020-1022). After the identification of these loci much of the work was directed into cleaning / leveling the trench. While doing this we uncovered two very small spots of different soil types, one within the wall, which had a yellowish color and the other along the North baulk, which had a grey color very much like the soil around it. These \spots\ seem to be made of coarse sand (very much like the sand we today use for concrete) which was entirely different from the surrounding clay. Adjacent to the East side of the wall foundation, in Locus 1004, was what we thought might be some mudbrick. We took a sample and labeled it KT 1020, we decided that it probably wasn't mudbrick so we dug through the layer and leveled the trench. Along the western baulk (locus 1004) we also found large pieces of pottery, which still sit in situ. They appear to be parts of storage vessels.         ,~: B-1-2000-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1003,"14,2000-07-24," A-1-2000-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1003,","   July, 24 2000      It's second day without David, I think I can handle this.... Begin excavating Locus 1005. Took out the intact bone (KT 1031), and made 2 L of soil sample, I tried not to include the soil on top, then excavating further down with brush. I found this method time consuming but turned out to be a excellent choice. Loose soil could be removed by brush, but the compacted soil will remain there. Continued worked for this pit, and found a straight line of compacted soil (Kind of split the pit into two, running along the middle). First I thought the pit was narrowing down, but the line was straight, it turned out to be a pit inthe pit!    While I was cutting down the west wall of the pit (Locus 1004 wall), I found a hard soil in a shape of a pipe. It looked like a pipe, but it may be some animal hole. When I tried to measure the diameter, the accident happened; the possible pipe was destroyed. If I could find the similar  hing\ somewhere else, I will try to be more careful. For the second pit, I assigned a new KT # for the finds.    While I was workig on the pit, I made the workers take down Locus 1006 &amp; 1004. For Locus 1004, We first left the line mud-brick intact. In Locus 1006, we found some human bone concentrated on one area (KT 1034), and nearly complete bowl (KT 1036). Also, found 2 large rocks. In locus 1004, we found concentration of pottery and one bone close to the mud-brick. The soil showed some variation on surface. The wiggling shape locus (1001 &amp; 1002) that we made seems to follow the general looseness of the soil in this trench; this indicate that the soil is disturbed, or we might find several pits here. The mud-brick, seems to me that it is some kind of oven, but the surface is not burnt, so I do not know.   About locus 1005.... We found burial, within the smaller pit in the pit. It tuurned out to be the outline of the pit above was too small, and we have to knock down the wall of the pit. It seems to be a multiple burial. One person was nearly intact, and could follow the outline clearly. however, there was one femur, lined in opposite direction, and found several pieces of bones above. It could be a mass grave site!!!!               ,~: A-1-2000-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1003,"15,2000-07-24," C-2-2000-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,","   July 24, 2000   We began by excavating the animal bone deposit (L2003). Our plan is to slice the top off our \mudbrick fall\ (L2002) to determine its nature, lower L2005 by 10-15 cm to further expose the mudbrick fall, and then continue excavation.   when we arrived at the site we noticed that some long bones that were protruding from the L2003 yesterday were removed today by looters.   After consulting with Andy we concluded that we had two mudbricks and a possible eroded fallen mud wall. We proceeded to section the trench into quadrants. The mud platform would be leveled to the same depth as L2005 with the exception of the two mud bricks and a rock between them- L2002. We closed 2003 and opened the area beneath it as L2007. L2007 appears to be a layer of fill with some animal bones sticking out. We believe it is the same as L2004. We will dig L2007 sown another 10-15 cm. The eastern half of the trench will be divided into two halves- a north and a south. After taking down L2007 we will proceed to lower L2008- the southeast corner- by 10-15 cm. Hopefully this will illuminate our situation with our mud brick wall.   We divided the trench into quadrants and changed loci. At 12pm we are working with 4 loci(2007, 2008, 2009, 2010) and our mudbricks (2002). We split the trench into quads in order to have greater horizontal control, over this seemingly large fill area.   In L2007 we have uncovered the top of a possible potsmash. We will continue to lower these loci.   As we investigate the section on the east side, we can see some indication of a possible mudbrick construction (some thin red lines separated by a thin white line) but this is very uncertain.     ,~: C-2-2000-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,"16,2000-07-25," B-1-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1004,","   7/25/2000   We began the day by making a conserted effort to keep up with our notebook. We took bottom elevation on all loci. Then we remeasured the debris of stones/pottery and the west pot smash.We started by digging in the north west area of Locus1007 trying to follow the debris. When we discovered many small stones and some pottery in this area we dug further towards the west baulk and came upon some very soft soil that had no rocks within it. We thought we might have another pit and started a new KT#1042 for pottery and KT# 1043 for bone. About .5 m out from the north baulk we found some mudbrick debris so we isolated that area for futher investigation. We changed the locus along the East baulk to Locus1011 ( at this point JPP felt very tired ) JPP had so far been working on the heap of pot sherds in locus 1011.   Drew came by and helped us prepare the trench for photos, after the photos were taken, we lowered Locus1007 (Easten edge) 5 cm, to search for more of the rocky debris or cobblestone floor. One of the workmen found the time teach us a little Turkish, especially the words small and large.   We continued the search for debris from the west baulk towards the SE-corner. Aziz, while digging, came upon a floor in the NW corner of the 1007-area, and the search began to find more of this floor, we began tracing this (in small chunks) all over Locus1007. We also found another concentration of pot sherds at the Southern part of Locus 1007 which we half heartedly cleaned because we found it so late in the day. Bradley-bay came by to tell us that he thought that the pottery and rock debris in Locus 1007 may have occured before the wall in Locus 1008 was built. This makes sense considering that after we cleaned the wall thoroughly we thought the debris continued under the wall as opposed to being debris from the wall itself. We decided that our next step would be to thoroughly map and draw the trench as it stood as well as trying to find where the debris ended in the trench. We want to lift the rocks from the wall and the floor as soon as possible so that maybe we can find the floor surface beneath.     ,~: B-1-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1004,"17,2000-07-25," C-1-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1005,","   July 25, 2000   We have only a rise in the Southeast corner- where we took the pot smashes from yesterday. That is L1005. There was a little reddish dirt when we scrapped on the top just west of the nice rimmed pot. We will flatten 1005 and clean the entire flat trench to look for some change. Where we cleared 1005 on the North side of the current rise (middle of the East side), we have some pot smashes all level, and level with the carbon sample. We removed the carbon sample from L1006, Kt1045. And it's elevation is 92.40. in the L1006 there are some pots, mortar, pestle and there are also some rocks in the western side of these. It may be a surface. We will call it Elvan's Kitchen. We will level the SE corner and we will check if there is pottery under that part. In the SE side we found some more pieces of the nice rimmed pot that we took out yesterday (KT1042,L1004). We saw a little white plaster but it doesn't look like a line. And we are digging the NW quarter of the trench (15-20cm).   We have started digging the Northwest corner again, we first dropped 10cm and then another 10. We need to level the whole West (downhill side) and then clean it.   We have almost brought the Southeast side down to level. That means 1005 will soon disappear.   The Northwest corner is 1007. The only thing we have removed so far is the carbon sample. We have found the nice bottom of the nice rimmed pot a little Southwest of the previous piece. We also found another piece Northeast of it. We continue to level the Southeast. Also we are continuing South on the West side to level it all the way across.   We found another piece of sandstone as we found in the rock garden in the SW side of the trench.   We continue, we have to take a lot of dirt out of the West side. There doesn't seem to be much, but there has been some more of those white flakes. Perhaps it is more of what we see in 1005. We are now sweeping the East side of the trench. With that white material, and pot smash and some rocks. We need a photo!     ,~: C-1-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1005,"18,2000-07-25," A-2-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   July 25, 2000      We started the day by cleaning up the north section of the trench and taking a million elevations. Set upthe next step downhill as a 2m x 2m but we will not dig there yet. We had to use a 2m rod with 6m of string attached and a plumb bob to run the lines downhill because of the sharp incline. There may be some minor error in the alighnment, but the square measures2m on each side fairlypreciselydespite all.      First we dug down the formerlylevel floor of the trench on the north side, starting at 1m from the south baulk and extending out to the north edge. We dug down 25 cm, took elevations. We called this L2002 because it is still a sub-topsoil layer.      Then we dug down the SW section below L2003 of our former 3m x 2m trenchand assigned a new locus 2004 because we believe we had hit a floor at the base of 2003. The soil in 2004 was very hard packed compared to what we had come across thusfar. We pulled out a flat stone (for bread?), several pig (?) bones and some nice pot sherds.      Next we dug down the north section as locus 2005 which is equivalent to 2002 sub-topsoil layer so that our loci numbers would work correctly. This section begins 150 cm from the south baulk and extends to the northern edge. We dug down circa 25 cm. This section was fill, loose sub-topsoil with some stones but not as many stones as the 2002 section between the south baulkand the 2meter pin.        ,~: A-2-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2000,"19,2000-07-25," C-2-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,","   July 25, 2000   Today we will need to get elevations for L2010. We will then proceed to excavate the quadrants beginning with L2009 then going on to L2010. The depths of the east and west halves of the trench will be staggered into a steplike configuration with loci 2007 and 2009 being deeper than loci 2008 and 2010. By doing this we hope to determine if the mudbricks we have unearthed are at the top of a wall and by going deeper we can uncover it.   After consulting with Bradley we decided to level L2010 to the same depth as L2008. Then we will take a section of L2002 to see if the fallen mudbrick wall is more apparent. After that we will consult with Bradley again. In L2002 there are a few clumps of pottery, a couple of which look articulated.   After consulting Andy we decided that we definitely had a three tier mud brick wall, but we weren't sure where it went. We decided to take L2009 down by 20cm because it seemed fairly empty . Though we are keeping our eyes open for pits. We will trowel down the edges of L2008 and L2010 as well as the bottom in the hopes of better defining our mudbrick will.   After going down on L2009 we came across a deposit of ash- an oven. To define the area of the oven we took out a smashed pot in L2007 and renamed it L2011. We will now go sown on L2007 to help define the oven. We continue to level and trowel L2008 and L2010 to define the limits of our mudbrick wall.     ,~: C-2-2000-07-25 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,"20,2000-07-26," B-2-2000-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2003,","   July 26, 2000      We began by sweeping the trench really, really well for a publishable photo of our floor. This took about 2 hours and was quite tedious.       After the photos we noticed that the south eastern corner of the trench seemed to be a different color and texture from the surrounding soil. The section seems to indicate a change as well. I have designated it a pit and given it L-2009. The color was matched to Munsell's \gray 6/1\. Other than ascertaining these few facts this new locus was left alone for the rest of the day.      Phil was feeling very sick and went home after breakfast. I toil alone.      I dug 15cm in southern half of L-2005. The area seems to be simply wash from hillside erosion so I felt that 15cm was justified without fear of tearing up the floor from L-2007 that doesn't seem to exist on that side of the trench.      I also took a section around L-2004 down about 10 cm. I am trying to determine if the red stain extends below the surface layer. After the section is cut precisely around the circle we will cut the circle in half and see what lies within.      I also took elevations for the rocks that surround the pot smash.      I finally took out the pot smash today. The area surrounding it was to the a point 4-5cm under where the pot rested so it was not needed for context anymore. Additionally we were worried that someone might mess with it since its been in there for a few days and lots of people know about it. Since we have a free day tomorrow and will be out of town, out came the pot. The dirt inside was gven L-2010 and it was all saved (KT#'s 2041 &amp; 2042) for a floatiation sample. Some pot sherds that were found yesterday in the rocks surrounding the pot were at roughly the same elevation as the bottom of the pot.

But as with the South Side, these white pieces are not forming a line which would indicate some sort of architecture.   We decided to dig the higher part of L1007 in the middle so we will have a section. And then we will remove the rest.   We found a piece of teeth in the section in the middle, it might be an animal bone buried there or related with the surface (Elvan's kitchen).   We cleaned the West surface and began a probe from there heading East to the middle of the nice-rimmed pot and Elvan's kitchen. Also, in the very Northwest corner, there are some bones and loose soil which we will open as L1008, a pit.   I removed a large piece of pottery about half way down the probe, 10cm below the surface of the kitchen.   In the probe we found some rocks at the level of the West side of the trench. They look like they are a circle. And some cobbles also.   We found some white chalk-like particles in the Northern side of the middle section. We opened a new locus 1008, we thought there was a pit but we couldn't find too much pottery or bones in it. It was obvious that it was loose.   We are now cutting 1007, from the probe to the South side. We will try to find the rest of Peter's pot. Before breakfast we thought there was some mud brick in the NW part but we couldn't see the edges. There were some lines but probably they were because of the roots.   We have a bunch of so-so stuff and it is hard to put it all together. The rock circle seems promising as the dirt in the wall above it is very pebbly. The kitchen even seems to form a circle. I found some ash in the Southwest corner, but we have no facilities to remove it.        ,~: C-1-2000-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1006,"22,2000-07-26," A-2-2000-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   July 26, 2000      Todaywe got a 3rd workman so we could bust thru more topsoil. We started moving topsoil as L2000 from the northern-most 2m x 2m square that we had measured off yesterday. We used the floor of L2005 at the 3m pin from the south baulk as the reference to dig out L2000 so that its floor would be on the same elevation level as 2005.      Simultaneously we took off the SE corner (1m x 1m x 25cm section of 2004 east) which had the burn marks and potteryon the floor and in the baulk (see  p.5 July 24). Once that 1m x 1m was removed, L2004 was a \flat\ surface extending 150 cm from the south baulk.      Then we straightened the baulks with a plumb bob and levels.      While that was happening, we had the workers cut the northern edge of the step corresponding to the 3m pin--first 50cm north of the pin as L2000, on the east side only (leaving the west side [ie., 1m wide] so Bradley and Andy can see the section/stratigrahy). Then we cut thesection 35cm south of the 3m pin on the east side as L2005. This split was made so that there would be no contradiction between this layer of locus and the loci above it that meet at the 3m pin.      Then because we had a little time left, we had the workers take out the L2000 section off the west 1m up to the 3m pin. We will take out the small 1m wide x 35cm long section of 2005 on Friday (perhaps?).

I found some hard compacted mud-brick. It seems to be following the rocks. The workers excavated the locus 1009 (NW section). They found some bones scattered around, and found a skull directly below the mud-brick that we found in 1004. The skull was small and thin, possibly a baby or an animal. also beside this skull we found possible human finger, not related to the skull (finger was for fully mature adult). Also, foud a mandible of some animal that seems to be baked (was black color). Also, we cleared the locus 1008 (South half of the unit). The pit that we found previously was more clearly defined , and compacted sand was a mud-brick. It probably represent surface. We had to make several new locus. See plan map for detail. The rocks, within the rocks, pit, floor area, and also an oven near West wall. The soil contained dark ash, some red bricks and burned bricks. We decide to make this oven locus larger, to include the ash layer. The soil was loose at the SW corner, and found some animal bone, this will be another locus.     The NW section gave me a hard time to clearly define the limit of the floor or a pit. There was a clear line of possible mud-brick surrounding the skull. The finger bone south of the skull was in loose layer of sand. At the center of the unit was some orangish soil, also, there seems to be some pit around this discoloration. The burial pit extends to this locus, but had the mud brik line above this. We will scrape this area more carefully and see what's going on to make more new loci!            ,~: A-1-2000-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1005,"24,2000-07-26," C-2-2000-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,","   July 26, 2000   We will begin today by taking elevations of all the presently existing loci. We will then continue to level and trowel L2008 and L2010 in the hope of defining the course of our mudbrick wall. We will also clean up L2007 and L2009 in order to better define the area of our oven. Then we will probably go further down on L2007.   After consulting with Bradley we noticed that we had at least three mud brick walls in our trench. We are still trying to define where the wall in L2008 goes, but the walls in L2007 and L2010 are fairly clear. Our hearth turned out to be three hearths. We believe it is a migrating hearth where one was built and then it gets moved around for one reason or another. We are currently trying to determine the depths of these hearths. The hearths become opened up as a new locus- L2012. We came to the bottom of L2011 and closed that locus. A wall is now becoming apparent in L2009. This along with a stone wall in L2012. Also in L2012 we have uncovered a small ceramic piece which looks to me like an open chicken beak. This is probably the first true small find of the dig. We took measurements and diagrammed the walls and hearths in our day plan, page 6. Tomorrow we have the day off, but the day after that we will probably come down around the hearths and the walls. All in all it was a good day of excavation and it is too bad that Chuck wasn't present for it. Most important, our small find and plethora of mudbrick walls really shows up our archrival trench, those B2 bastards.     ,~: C-2-2000-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,"25,2000-07-28," C-2-2000-07-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2002,","   28 July 2000   Today we will excavate the hearth (l2012) and our strategy will be to further define our mudbrick walls. We are as yet uncertain as to the nature of the south side of the trench because no definite structural lines can be discerned, but this looks to be the same texture as our definite mud bricks in the north side. Therefore we think it is mudbrick, but we do not know if it is a collapsed wall or a more definite configuration.   After consulting with Bradley we decided to take a section from L2008 and opened it as L2013. The purpose of this was to determine if we had another mudbrick wall or just collapse. Sure enough we began to see a wall from this section. we finally closed L2002, its purpose having been served to locate mudbrick. We leveled our migrating hearth L2012 and observed that the pit had been covered with \slup\- eroded mudbrick wash. In fact the hearth has major sluppage action. Not surprising we were the only trench with sluppage action. All the loser trenches had no sluppage. Below the slup was more ash layer.   In order to better define our mudbrick walls we decided to come down 10cm on the fill between our walls which we opened as loci L2014 in the north and L2016 in the south. The fill will be opened as L2015. The fill between L2016 and the southside of the trench becomes L2017.   By closing time we decided to combine L2007 and L2009 into a new locus L2018. We also decided to combine L2008 and L2010 into one locus L2019. We did this because they appear to be the same and we wanted to simplify our loci.   In conclusion we once again proved that C2 is where it is at. Our screaming chicken and plethora of mudbrick walls shows that we are badasses.

We started this trench as a half trench (2*4 m) and numbered it locus 3000 (KT# 3000 pottery and 3001 bone).   We then instructed our workers to dig 10 cm. Rigth after the first couple of strokes from the pick axe, we hit rocks. After a quick cleaning of these, it became apperant that we had a continuation of the architecture from trench B1 (more specific locus 1008).   We then continued cleanning the trench, until one of the workmen called us over to look at a bone, at first we belived it to be an animal bone, but Andi convinced us that it was in fact human, and it was the upper arm bone. Then we started a search for the outline of the pit/burial and came to the conclusion that the burial had been so disturbed(either by us, graverobbers or errosion of the tepe), that this was not possible to find.    Then we began to clean the corpse and quickly found the skull sticking out from the baulk and the other upperarm bone. Between the two arms we had difficulty cleaning, because of the many splintered ribs. Just to the rigth of the corpse there seemed to be a small heap of pottery, (KT# 3002) that migth have connections with the burial.

After Breakfirst it became clear that Drew was not ready to take the plan photo yet. We then decided, together with Andi &amp; Bradley, that we should start another trench next to B1, primerily this trench should trace L. 1008. So we spent the rest of the day laying out the new square. The special thing about these two, was(is) that they shared a .5m wide baulk.

We will then remove the remainder of L2012. Meanwhile we will also excavate L2019 starting at the rock lense (L2020) in the southeast corner, exposing it to see if it is the base of our mudbrick debris in that location. Meki will excavate L2019 close to the mudbrick wall on the north side of the trench (L2014).   By 11:35 am we have dug L2019 about 15 cm deeper, L2015 10 cm deeper, L2012 (ash pit/migrating hearth) we have been articulating the edges further, which surprisingly have run underneath L2016 (mudbrick wall, SW corner). This could be due to an animal burrow found nearby (about 10 cm to the west of the ash layer). Brian has been working in the SE corner articulating a rock-bone-pottery (L2020) which indicates a new level of deposition. We have also exposed a pit which is mostly located in the section, but extends 32 cm from the south section. Below it's ash fill is a layer of small stones, perhaps lining the bottom or thrown into it.   The fill to the northwest side of L2014 (mudbrick wall) has been designated L2021. About 10 cm down we found a stone alignment with a large corrugated potsherd. To the east of this locus, Andy suggests that another wall exists (see drawing):   In L2019 after scraping it flat Andy found some distinctively red soil. We will give this a new locus (L2025) and work around it for the time being. Andy also thought he saw possible mudbrick lines bisecting L2018 and L2019. Tomorrow we shall investigate these possible mudbricks and plan our strategy accordingly.   In summation, we have once again proved that the C2 Screamin' Chickens have the best trench of the entire tepe.

The bad data is confined to the closing elevations for that day, and was possibly caused by an unlevel level. We will try to replace what measurements we can by taking elevations off the balk.      We scraped L 2005 in order to see what we could see. While we were doing this, our workmen brought L's 2007 and 2011 down approximately 10 cm, evening them out with the bottom of the section of L 2008 that was dug on the 26th.      Meanwhile, back in L 2005, we came across the top of a mudbrick wall running east-west through the approximate center of the locus. This wall was renamed L 2013. The area to the south was labelled 2014; that to the north was called L 2016. A small, clay lined pit discovered in the southwest of L 2014 was named L 2015.      The workmen then dug the eastern half of L 2014 to a depth of 20 cm.      L 2015, excavated by Dawnelle, was discovered to be a 34 cm diameter circle, lined with broken potsherds. Similar to the donut discovered some days ago (L 2004), the soil appeared burnt. Its color was established as reddish yellow, (6/6). Also like L 2004, the pit was rather shallow, terminating in a large rock which was continuous with L 2014.      While Dawnelle was digging L 2015, Phil was engaged in the painstaking excavation of several small ash pits located underneath loci 2011 and 2008 in the southeast corner of the trench. An arbitrary area, L 2017, was set up to include all of the pits, which were then excavated as if they were one larger pit.      After Dawnelle had completed excavating 2015, the workmen dug the remainder of L 2014, except for a small area along the south balk which may possibly be another mud brick wall.     ,~: B-2-2000-07-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2005,"30,2000-07-29," B-1-2000-07-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1006,","   7/29/2000   Damn Diabetes, Jakob was not able to be at the dig today.

Among this were 10 finds of basalt tools.   We also decided that the baulk between trench B1 and B3 should be excaveted, at least down to the foundation wall. To avoid spill of soil in to Loci (3001 and 1014) we were going to take soil samples from and sift later. We decided, with advice from Andi, to make small buffer zones/miniature baulks, 10cm wide, that later would be taken down as well. The Northern part, where we wanted to protect L.1014, became Locus 1016 and the southern part, protecting 3001, became Locus1015. Apart from working on the baulk-loci, we also sifted the dirt from L.1014, looking for artifacts. And with great success, many small potsherds and bones. After this we took soil samples.   In L.1016 we did find a continuation of the cobble foundation wall, found in L.1008 and L.3002.   At the end of the day, we hadn't been able to complete the digging in the baulk.

Because of the large stones and pottery located in L2021 and the fact that they were floating suggests that they rested atop a surface and were unrelated to the stones in L2018. We will now change the locus to L2024 to be a surface.   The depth of L2014 is still undetermined at this time.

While this was going on, Phil continued digging in the pit, L 2009. Later, Bradley and Andy came by and told us to create new loci in the eastern half of the trench. The south side of the trench, under L 2011, will be L 2018. This area is mostly softer crumbly dirt. The north side of the trench, under L 2007 and the northern ~15cm of L 2011, will be called L 2019. This locus has areas of hard material, possibly mud brick debris. Other parts are similar to L 2018.      In addition, we are assigning a new locus number to the hard, mud brick like area in the eastern part of L 2016. It will now be known as L 2020.     ,~: B-2-2000-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2009,"36,2000-07-30," A-2-2000-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","    July 30, 2000      Today we articulated more of the bones and potsherds in L2007 and believe there may be rocks/cobbles corresponding to the cobblestones of L2008. We also articulated more stones in the eastern part of L2008 ad realized that the far NE corner of the cobble strip has cobbles only at a lower level/elevation than the surrounding cobbles; ie., there is a pocket of lower cobbles; maybe a pit??      We had the workmen dig down between the 4-5m pins as L2002 subtopsoil and came up with a pocket of hard-packed soil in the SW corner of this section--maybe mudbrick??      The workers also cleaned up the area between the 7m and 9m pins, which they had begun yesterday but did not finish.     ,~: A-2-2000-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2000,"37,2000-07-30," B-3-2000-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 3/Locus 3000,","   7/30/2000   We started the day with measuring/ taking elevations. After which we consulted Andi on the subject of the burial (mostly on how to excavate it) We agreed on that we needed to tear down the baulk surrounding the skull/head of the corpse. This process was going to take place anyhow since we where articulate the foundations in the baulk. With Andi's help we outlined the burial pit within the trench (locus 3001, KT# 3004-3005), at the same time we opened locus 3002 (KT# 3007) which is the contiuation of L. 1008 &amp; 1016 from trench B1. After this we began taking the baulk down around the burial. This process took the rest of the day.

Consisting of the two piles of rocks in the eastern half of the trench, these loci were excavated by Bradley (with the help of Betsy) in the space of approximately 2 minutes. We had quite a time corraling flying chunks of basalt, pottery and other miscellaneous heavy stuff. Not to mention trying to assign everything KT numbers. Anyway, after excavating around the rock piles on previous days, we had come to the conclusion that they were free floating and probably sitting on the same surface as our beautiful smashed pot.       L 2021, the area of rocks straddling L's 2018 &amp; 2019, contained the three chunks of grindstone assigned KT's 2074-2076. L 2022 is the area of rocks associated with the pot smash, and contained one large chunk of basalt.      After the morning's excitement, we settled back into our routine of straightening balks, sections, and floors. The mini balk around L 2009, created when 2018 was being dug, was removed. In addition, L 2020 and the southern part of L 2014 were troweled in the hope of discovering mud brick lines. The area in the middle of L 2014 is very soft and is quite possibly a pit. Once troweling and cleaning is complete, we may assign it another locus.      L 2014 is now closed. We found we think to be a section of wall heading north out of the S balk. This wall, L 2023, is interupted by the soft pittish area, L 2024. East of the pit and wall is now L 2025; to the west is L 2026.      After these numbers were assigned, we had the workmen dig the eastern half of 2013 down to the level of the mud bricks that we found in the north of what was L 2014. These bricks have been, for the time being, incorporated into L 2013. We are not sure if they are collapse, or if they represent the true line of the wall, as they veer off from the upper part of 2013.        ,~: B-2-2000-07-31 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2009,"39,2000-07-31," C-2-2000-07-31 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2013,","   31 July 2000   We began the day by getting photos of L2020 and plan shots of some of our walls. We took out the pottery and stone debris from L2020 and closed that locus. Below it we opened L2026, a fill layer composed of a very hard mudbrick debris. We also leveled L2019. While cleaning up L2026 we came to a softer level which we decided to open as a pit L2027.   At about ten to eight am we closed up L2013. Later while digging in L2026 we came upon another pit which was quite deep. We believe it is another oven, perhaps destroyed or an ash pit associated with a food preparation area. L2022 looks like a kiln because of all the hard-packed stone.   To make our trench more simplified, we consolidated L2019 and L2026 in to a new locus L2029. We did not see a difference between these two loci, thus we combined them. We ended the day by digging 10 cm into L2029. We also articulated our north/south mudbrick wall (L2023) down about 10 cm. The southwest corner of our trench is becoming quite interesting. On the east section is an ash pit of a relatively large and deep size - filled with ashy soil and charred bone. to the immediate southwest of this pit is what we believe to be the kiln L2022. A great deal of diagnostic pottery was found in the structure. It's base is a very hard pack of fired clay and stone. That will have to stay in our section as pulling it out will leave a large hole there.   Our strategy tomorrow will be to excavate L2029 to the level of some green-yellow mudbrick material seen in a section under L2023. We will also finish L2022 and photograph it.     ,~: C-2-2000-07-31 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2013,"40,2000-07-31," B-3-2000-07-31 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 3/Locus 3000,","   7/31/2000   To day we took the rest of the baulk down, thereby exposing the rest of the burial. Continued with cleaning the area, readying for photo's. These were taken and we began removing the bones, placing them in 3 boxes, 1 for the rigth side, 1 for the left and for the cranium. During this we took soil samples from the pit and the burial (from within the cranium)   This closed the activity in B3 for the day.     ,~: B-3-2000-07-31 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 3/Locus 3000,"41,2000-08-01," C-1-2000-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1009,","   August 1, 2000      We start today by separating all the loci. Then we saw that the level surface between the wall of L1019 and L1011 seemed to be different along the lines of where L1014 was. On the North it was more dirt and soft reddish. On the South it seemed more blocky and crumbly like the topsoil. So North is L1020, South L1016. We will clear and level both. We will screen a bucket from each since here may be a surface associated with our walls. North is Kt1117 screen, south is kt1118 screen.   Elvan started to dig the Southeast corner of L1021 from L1009. She wants to articulate the corner which seems to be here at the intersection. She found a clam shell which I gave Kt1120. We haven't hit upon any more large rocks in the clearing of that surface.   We decided to level everything but we felt bad about our mud-brick so we decided to leave it there. Don't worry! We put a tag on it so it won't be mixed with anything: \Lovely mud-brick.\ We found one more white rock (we found one in the Southeast corner a few days ago) in L1016.   We don't have our mud-brick anymore and Peter is cutting L1017 from the West. Then we will clean the trench. We found some more rocks under L1017.   We found some reddish stuff that might be pieces of an oven and it might be related with the rimmed pot. And maybe related with all pot smashes there. I will put that piece in a Kt bag. We found another piece of obsidian. We usually find that on both sides of the wall L1011. The rocks that we found under L1017 might be near an oven because we found some reddish stuff with some possible ash. Also we found a beautiful cover of a pot there.   After clearing the surface of L1016 and L1020 we found nothing, so we will call it L1020 all across the Northeast corner between walls L1019 and L1011. Except in the center where we are digging down 10cm to find if there are anymore rocks, this we call L1022.   We are digging 1020 for 15cm. There is an interesting piece of pottery in the middle of the rocks that we found under L1017. It looks like the top of something with a little square piece to hold.

We then got photos of two pits L2022 and L2028. We then proceeded to take down L2029 by 5 cm. We are cautious when diggin near L2023 our north/south mudbrick wall because we are looking for the second course of brick which is designated by a yellowish green tint. Our man plan is to dig L2029 down to the level of L2018. We will then re-evaluate our loci and plan our strategy according to the layout of our trench at that more uniform elevation.   11:30. We decided to take L2025 down by 5 cm at first and then probably more depending on what we see. We also noticed a mudbrick between L2022 and L2028 so we opened up that L-shaped area as L2030. Hopefully we will be able to consolidate L2029, and L2018 because they appear to be the same color and texture - a light grayish brown mudbrick collapse. We also hope to close out L2022 and L2028. All of these could probably be combined into a singular locus. We also want to articulate our mud brick wall L2023. Perhaps we can even get a good plan photo before the day is over.    We did consolidate L2029 and L2018 as they appear to be the same material. We are continuing to articulate L2023 our north south mudbrick wall. Our plan photo will have to wait until tomorrow, however.   In conclusion, our ability to handle the extreme complexity of our trench proves we are far beyond the operating level of the other trenches. C2 is a textbook example of how to excavate a trench. We're putting on an archaeology clinic. I do have one major point of contention today and, surprisingly, it doesn't involve B2. Instead it is B1, at least, half of B1. That stupid piÕó_ took a nice cold bottle of Uludag out of our cooler at the end of the day. There was no consideration whatsoever, just petty theft. Now I don't want to disseminate any stereotypes, but right now I'm thinking that the Danes are an ethic-lacking people. They don't seem to belong to society, but are rather a parasite gorging itself on the rest of civilized humankind.

Exposed spinal cords. After finishing, begin to box the baby. By tomorrow, all the bones should be taken up. One strange thing that I noticed today was that his right hand was almost completely missing, except for one finger. The right hand was where Ulna and Radius was crossed (twisted). This, I think, occured before his death. At least, I hope this to be the case. When I was digging around his right finger, the soil was compacted and hard. There is no possibility that his finger was destroyed from excavating. We should analyze the bones carefully to see if there is any indication of pre-mortal injury. What I am thinking is that some animal chewd away his finger; this explain the missing finger and the twisted arm. Although the finger bones coud be easily misplaced after burial, I like my idea better. Some pieces of vertebra collum was missing, but those bones probably decayed, since those bones are fragile. By he way, we named this skelton Cocaine Joe. For references, the elevation of the skull is 99.70, pelvis at 99.60, and foot at 99.57. I have not checked the elevation of the skelton in 1026, but it seems much higher than the skelton in 1015s    Locus 1026While I articulate the bones from 1015, Ihsan took down the burial pit of 1026, which is directly East of 1015. This skelton was layed sideways facing south (so the left shoulder of this person is close to the surface), fully extended (legs are in the balk). This burial is oriented East and west, head is at the West, and slightly tilted towards North. I should check the angle of all the burial with a compass. So far, all burials that I uncovered, 1005, 1011, 1015, and 1026, head is placed on West side. However, angle is all different. This poor person, as I noted above, lost his/her head when the pit was dug for 1015. It is now obvious... We should articulate this baby and put them into the boxes.    Some consideration about the burials. Since this trench is ancient necropolis, I will write what I think about these burials. 1- it is all close to surface, so it is possibly Hellenistic in age or earlier, but I have to wait for the pottery reading. 2- burials 1005, 1011, 1015, 1026 are all extended and somewhat oriented towards West. I am not sure these indicate any relationship. Ancient people had an idea that West is a place for death because the sun sets on west. 3- so far, I found possible 3 burial goods on 1011, 1015, and 1009 surface (about 1 m away from the baby skull). All of them were volcanic rock grind stone, that is shaped flat (I will check the measurmet tomorrow). 4 - Elevation of the burial 1011 and 1015 is about the same 99.69 and 99.79. However, 1026 is higher and 1005 is lower.

What were we to do? We have a hole lot of rubble and some floors, which seem to be endless, but contain nothing useful. We cleaned L.1017 for a last photo of the surface, before we could chop further. While this was going on we named everything East of L.1008 and L.1017 (L. 1023) for L.1021. We started digging at the western most point, where L.1008 and L.1021 meet, digging from there towards the west baulk, turning north when we reached the western baulk. We did not find another floor/surface10 cm down. Up on reaching the North baulk, we did find a pit. Which contained vastly looser soil, so decided to define its edges rigth away, hoping that it is not animal holes again, but we found some bone spilters, scaring the living daylights out of us (Did we accidently ploug through another deader?) Instead when we defined the pit L.1022 we found to be 30cm deeb, all dirt was sifted and there were taken samples of it. At the bottom we found another pile of thrash (potsherds and bones), this was left there. As there were more \important\ (can't remember why?) work to do... We made sure that in L.1021 we sifted 1:5 buckets of dirt, because we didn't want to loose all the important small finds.   As we began to dig the bottom of L.1017/the top of L.1023 we sifted all the dirt (WE DO NOT LIKE SIFTING, it's boring). Ofcourse we ende up finding something cool 1/2 hour before we should leave. As Aziz was cleaning L.1023 (sweeping) he found a nice little stone bowl, just a few cm below the surface. We noted its possition, but left it standing, because it could be standing on a surface, which we hadn't uncovered.     ,~: B-1-2000-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1006,"45,2000-08-01," B-2-2000-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2013,","   August 1, 2000      We started out by sweeping the trench so that Drew could take a photgraph of the new Loci in the SW quadrant of the trench. After that business was complete, we chopped the northern third of L 2019 down to the level of L 2020, and straightened the balks and sections so that we could look for mud bricks again.      Erdan was put to work excavating a new pit in L 2018, L 2027.       Andy came by and said that L 2019 still didn't make any sense. There was a lot of slumpage, and no clear lines. To try and figure out what's going on, we are nowgoing to dig the rest of L 2019 down to the level of L 2020. The soil in this section appears to be compacted mud brick debris, with areas of looser crumbly soil.       While L 2019 was being dug, we also dug the remainder of the hump in L 2013, so that the entire wall was approximately level.      Drew came over and asked us to make him do manual labor, so we had him dig and scrape balks for a while.      After finishing digging L 2019, we dug the northern half of L 2018.

During this we opened locus 3003, the soil, that L. 3001 was cut into.   The soil removed contained a wide assembly of pottery and bone.    After digging 10 cm and cleaning, we uncovered a \surface\ that reminded us of the tumble found on top the floor in the naboring trench B1.

We will not dig that area until we lower the major portions of L2032. After that we will articulate the loose pocket of soil.   Our main strategy today is to articulate all mudbrick walls and mudbricks and then to prepare our trench for a trench plan photograph.   After investigating L2025 we have decided that it is not mudbrick, but possibly a debris fill. No outlines could be defined and the soil is mottled with light gray and yellowish green. The yellowish green soil could be (and is probably) a mudbrick layer. As we look in the section of L2023 (mudbrick wall running north south) on can see a course of yellowish green soil that is quite symmetrical. Andy decided that it was probably structural. the texture of this structural material is very chunky and brittle and quite loose. It is not nearly as compact as the top few courses of mudbrick found in L2014. After digging a few centimeters of L2025 a larger deposit of yellowish green soil was found, though there were no signs of mudbrick lines on or near its surface. Therefore we decided to cut further into it to catch it in the section of L2023. We will designate it a new locus. Other curious facts about the yellowish green soil are that it is heavily paced with white hair width roots. And regarding the yellowish green in L2023, it does not appear as symmetrical on the east side section as it is on the west side section.   This was our stopping point for today. We dig 10 cm lower in L2015 to expose more yellowish green material as well. After that point we prepared to take a trench plan photo which was nearly completed today.   We return to work on Saturday, August 5th.

(What locus is that? ect. ect.) We began to level L.1023, chopping about 5 cm through the middle around the rocks on the North baulk.We were trying to find out what kind layers there were bellow the floor (more floors?) We began to bring up more the the overfired clay and ash. We came upon some small circles of ash surrounded by a ring of overfired clay. As opposed to the usual sporadic occurance of the material near the rocks. We took a carbon sampleof ash and charcoal and conferred with Bradley on what the circles migth be. He said that they were the bottom of destroyed oven. We then articulated those areas of burnt ash and leveled the rest of L.1023. We still were sifting every peie of dirt in L. 1023, which slowed us down considerably. While working on L.1023 we also finished articulating the middle part of the foundation in L.1016, so we could get the last photo.   We are dying to chop up the foundation in L.1008, it's been around long enough. We also removed L.1006, so only L.1009 is the only locus at the west side of the foundation, to find the rest of the strata. We found the same mix of stuff, as we last itm we dug in this part of the trench (nothing), but a few sherds. The debris doesn't seem to continue on the west side of the foundation.   Back to L.1023, we are not sure what's going on. We found another group of potsherds, on the western most point, which we atticulated, thinking it migth lie on a new floor/surface. That is yet to decided. ???? 5 cm below the surface of the rock group by the north baulk, there doesn't seem to be anything burnt clay and ash under the stones.   About L.1020:   We opened a sounding at the east side of L.1016 in the baulk that separates B1 from B3 and called it L.1020, because it representates the material below the wall surface. We found a few large cobbles and a potsherd laying flat.

After a rousing au coppola rendition of Beethoven's 9th Symphony we decided to dig in the dirt. Our kid went to Jakob's trench, knocked out everyone and stole a flat small pick. We expect retribution from Area B during the later part of the day. It is quite amusing to watch our kid dig very slowly with an oversized hand pick. Elvan, who is by nature very cruel, decided that a tired, sad, suicidal, crying trench mate Pete is preferable to the one who is happy, good-natured, and full of life. We can only figure that she would make a poor Psychiatrist.   Our trench was pillaged last night by some locals searching for gold. Actually, someone saw a young lady from Ankara digging late in our trench last night. Elvan is a poet, she said, \If you close the cooler it will stay cooler.\ In reference to our water.   We are digging L1020 in the Northeast corner. We will level to the wall L1011 for photographs. We found a pile of medium-small rocks close to L1011 on the West side of L1020, at the same level as some other rocks.   In the Northwest corner we dropped L1025 about 10cm. We took some pottery out of the baulk about 10cm up so Andy won't kick it out. I separately kt'd it as kt1125.   Notice we decided to separated the pits in what used to be L1013. The rocks there potentially outline some separate storage areas, so the West one is L1023, the East L1024 and everything outside is L1025.   We cleaned our trench, sent the kid to get a good whipping at Elle's trench, let Lokman chill, and took plan photos of the whole thing.     ,~: C-1-2000-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1009,"50,2000-08-02," A-1-2000-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1,","   Aug 2, 2000   Locus 1026Today, I articulatedthe skelton and exposed femur and rib bones. The soil of this pit seems more compacted and more silty than burial 1015. Locus 1026 - 2.5 Y 6/2 silt, some pebbles, but smaller than 5 mm. locus 1015 - 2.5 Y 5/2 very fine sand to silt, some pebbles, some pebbles more than 5 mm, and find more number of small pebbles in 1015. Near this person's right femur, several fragment of bones were sticking from a wall. According to Andy, it is a fragment from mandible. The bones of this individual are more stable and thicker than that of 1015. We will hopefully examine this individual tomorrow.   Locus 1015We try to lift the skull of this individual today.... Well, we examined the skull, and it now appears to be more femal than male. When we were lifting the skull, I found two fragments of finger bone stuck in the skull. Also, later find out that the skull was full of bones, such as knee, vertebrate, and ribs. The skull was full of these bones. What it appears to be is that these bones were missing from the skelton. Probably, this person was killed, or died alone, and chewed by some animals. Later, some one picked up the pieces of this person and stuffed them into his/her skull. The occipital bone?-- (I don't know the name, but the bone of the skull that is flat and lay directly below the sinal cords, where the foram magnam (The hole for the spin) is-- was missing. This seems that people stuffed the skull with bone either removing, and chopping the skull, or it is possible that the skull was already smashed and people stuffed the bones from there. It is also possible that they stuffed the bones from mouth, since some teeth were misplaced and within the skull. I don't know what is going on, but many intersting scenario could be drawn from these finds.           ,~: A-1-2000-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1,"51,2000-08-02," B-3-2000-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 3/Locus 3001,","   8/2/2000   We started the day by taking bottom elevations for L.3001 and L. 3003.

L. 3004 is located between the foundation (L. 3002) and the north baulk, and migth have contained the material of a doorway.   While L. 3005 is a search area, made to search for floor levels. Though the first 10 cm didn't produce any results, except for a few scattered potsherds and bones, we still hope to find something......

We decided to take a skull with the soil and fingers intact. It seems that more bones were stuck into the back of the forehead area, some fingers and teeth were piled up in that area. This, for me, is to suggest that the bones were stuffed from the bottom (more to back-side) of the shull. Also, somehow the mandible were stuffed way up in the skull. We took C14 sample for dating; several ribs, both left and right were taken. I try to dig up some new pieces rather than using the exposed parts of the bones. Also, I used the dental pick and spoon (both metal), to pick the sample. Put them in the Aluminum foil, which I did not tuch the inside. I payed extreme caution for these samples, for there should be no contamination from this excavation. There could be a contamination from other causes, such as tree root activity, or A-Bomb test. As for yesterday, we took soil sample from each area of the body as we articulate the bones. We separated the samples from within the skull, around neck and the body, vertebrate area, ribs, and right femur area. Because the bones were soo fragile, we simple put the broken oiecrs of bones in the soil sample bag (ribs and vertebrates are in the soil bag and did not seoarately bag them). The head of the right femur were about 5 cm, and that seems to be little large to be a female. Gonial angle was 3 or 4 (examination from the mandible angle). Tomorrow, we must pick the rest of the legs and the pelvis. Hope we could know the sex of this person, either it will be Cocaine joe or Jenny.       KT 2000 Area A Trench 1      Brief summary from the pottery reading (Locus 1000 to 1010) (July 23, 2000)    *Must read update from Aug 19, 2000        Level 1(100.50 - 100.30)   Locus 1000 heavily disturbed zone, some Hel, EIA, and N5   # This is the layer of top-soil and directly below        Level 2 (100.30 - 100.15)   Locus 1001 IA and Hel mixed and showed no consistency, still in the zone of disturbance   Locus 1002 Mainly Hel in nature, and a possible N5 sherd. But some evidence of disturbance    # This level was probably occupied during Hel and later. East side shows the heavy mixing of materials. for some unknown reasons; the slope of the tepe may had some affect in the past. West side of the trench shows more stable soil and less disturbance.        Level 3 (100.15 - 100.00)   Locus 1003 Hel and IA mixed, still shows some disturbance   Locus 1004 possible N5 and EIA, shows little disturbance, clearly IA occupation.   Locus 1006 possible Iron age occupation, but not enough diag to specify   # This level was occupied in IA to Hel. Shows some disturbance in South and East of the trench. Since there were some soil variations and this seems to correspond with the pits and burials at the lower levels. NW corner of the trench represent clear IA occupation.        Level 4 (100.00 - 99.80)   Locus 1008 It shows some late pottery, and not enough evidence to suggest a clear age of occupation   Locus 1009 Several sherds from Assyrian, EIA, shows clear occupation of Iron Age   Locus 1010 Locus was too small to reveal any significant evidence of diag pottery   Locus 1007 Clearly shows Hel occupation, possible it was a pit; it's a Hellenistic slump. Found a large possible pit above the locus.   # This level seems to be occupied durring IA. However, for one section in NE, under a pit shows clear Hel materials. This pit was visible from Locus 1003. Also, some disturbance in the south is from the burials; this might suggest the age of the burials (Locus 1011, 1015, 1026, and 1017), but we must wait for the pottery reading for those loci       Burial (Locus 1005)   # From the pottery reading, this area represt clear IA burials, such as Pale-ware (Type I), Cor. Bowl, and possible N5 sherd. Although this burial is located directly north of the hellenistic slump, the pit was protected from the mud-brick lining. The questions to be asked is rather the deep pit within the pit represent differnt level than the one above. At this point, there is not enough evidence to suggest. Wait until the full pit is excavated and examined.           ,~: A-1-2000-08-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1,"53,2000-08-05," A-1-2000-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1,","            Aug 5, 2000   Today, I removed some loose dirt out from the burial pit 1015, articulated some more, took up the pottery near feet. That about what I did in this trench this day.   I will be opening up a new trench in area D, east side of the tepe, down the hill in somewhat flat area. Anyway, the decision was made because, there are just too many burials and I am not a burial specialist; I wish I had more knowledge of osteology. So, we will close this trench because we want to get more accurate information from the burials other than my own (and Andy). We will be excavating this trench next season, if there are a bone specialist. Before I completely close this trench, I have to make some point clear so that next year someone would not have trouble excavating the trench.       Right now, I exposed several new loci that never put my hands on it. Also, Oven I (locus 1018) and Oven II (locus 1024) is incomplete at this moment. Burial at locus 1011, 1026, and pit (possible burial) at locus 1017 is nearly completed. I will list, and make a brief description of all the loci that appears on the surface at this moment.   All loci up to 1010 has been excavated and finished completely (and does not exist anymore... good bye my friendly loci...) for those loci information check this  (Pottery reading summary, Aug 3)      --Locus 1011The burial at the SE corner, a burial in the South balk. Found a mud-brick line on surface under rocks(Locus 1012). This Locus is completed   --#Locus 1012The circular line of rocks sourrounding locus 1011. Mud-bricks is under the rocks. The purpose of the excavation of this locus will be clarifying the relationship with locus 1011(burial), locus 1013/1020 (surface), and the mud-brick underlining the rocks.   --#Locus 1013The mud-brick surface, same as locus 1020, but assigned this locus to south side of the burial pit (locus 1015). The purpose is to clarify the relationship between locus 1012, 1019, and 1016 (lining of rocks), and possible day the surface.   --Locus 1014Suppose to be a loose fill area between locus 1012 and 1019, just East of the burial 1015. However, this area was changed to burial (locus 1026). Now the Locus 1014 does not exist, make a new locus somewhere!   --Locus 1015Needless to say, it's a famous burial near the center of the trench.    --#Locus 1016Line of large rocks at the SW area of the trench. This locus abuts surface 1013/1020, pit 1017, Oven I (locus 1018). The purpose of the excavation is to see rather the pit 1017 extend below this locus; we found some human bones in locus 1017, and seems to continue down into the rocks.    --Locus 1017Pit at the SW corner of the trench. Found human bones, crushed into pieces, possibly extends to Locus 1016. Relationship with Oven I (Locus 1018) and mud-brick surface. Try to reconstruct which locus cuts which locus. this locus is completed.   --Locus 1018Oven I, just north of large rocks(locus 1016) and west of burial 1015. Burial 1015 probably cuts the Oven I. relationship between Oven II (locus 1024) must be clarify. Oven I and Oven II could be considered as one unit, but at this it is hard to determine. This locus is nearly complete but the oven (layer of soft ash) might extend further.    --#Locus 1019The somewhat circular lining of rocks just north of burial 1015. Similar structure to locus 1012.    --#Locus 1020Mud-brick surface, same as locus 1013. The north side of the burial 1015, but could be considered as one unit. Mud-brick does not appear clear at the north side of the trench.    --#Locus 1021The hard compacted silt layer at the NW corner of the trench (somewhat circular, 1.5 m diameter). Found a skull of a baby? in this area. Interesting to see the relationship with Oven II (locus 1024), and mud-brick surface.    --#Locus 1022The extension of the pit from burial 1005. Loose soil seems to follow a pit from east side.   --#Locus 1023A loose soil that seems to surrounds the silt layer (locus 1021) Found a human finger. The extension of this locus is hard to define since it is cut (or cut by )many loci: 1021, 1022?, 1024, 1020.   --Locus 1024Oven II. This area was difficult to excavate since many loci meets together and all of them seems to submerge, without any definate limit. This Oven seems to be cut by a pit in the middle. You will see some Oven frag, and flat surface on the south and dug out surface to north. The north of the oven had a loose soil and seems to continue further down. But to the south, somewhat compacted layer continues, but edges with mudbrick surface was not east to tell. I have not finished this locus but seems to be a better idea to leave at this moment. This locus requires time and care to excavate.   --Locus 1025This is locus is completed. It was thought to be a burial pit of a baby, within the locus 1011.   --Locus 1026Burial pit next to 1015. This person's head was smashed by pit dug by 1015.

After sweeping up in the southern section we began digging L2012 starting at the 4m pin and working southwards, east side first. After only 5 swings of the pick we hit what looks like cement-imbedded stones (which turned out to be Dicle conglommerate). They are larger stones than in L2009, but may still be considered cobbles. Maybe this is part of a defensive wall-system??       These rocks at the north edge of L2012 ended soon after they began--only about 50cm x 30cm were covereed by the rocks and Dicle conglommerate we continued digging the east side down to the elevation of these rocks and stopped at the south end adjacent to L2010 because the mudbricks we were intentionally cutting through became much harder. Our purpose was to catch the depth of the L2010 mudbrick wall in section. We then dug the west half of L2012 southwards until we again hit very hard mudbrick, the top of which we had already identified at the junction of L2011 and 2012. The baulk section shows varying colors of yellowish brown in the west baulk, approx beneath the area where we had found pink and yellow mudbrick in L2002 between the 3m and 4m pins right before we switched to L2012 on Aug 01. Munsell       We also moved L2002 subtopsoil betwen the 8m and 10m pins, very slowly because of lazy workmen (ie., Ihsan and Byron).     ,~: A-2-2000-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2002,"55,2000-08-05," C-1-2000-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1009,","      August 5, 2000      We separated the reddish stuff in the South of L1011 and the rocks perpendicular to the L1011 is L1027, on the east of L1027 is L1028. The rocks (L1030) probably fell fro L1011 but they are a separte locus now. We think the L1020 is more reddish now so we changed it as L1032. We sprayed the floor but couldn't see anything. And there is another circular formation in the NE corner (1/4 of a circle) with loose soil in it. This is L1031.   Now we are digging L1012. We are planning to level it. We will dig L1032 for 5cm then we will search for mud-brick. I kt'd a possible loom weight of stone from L1012 in kt1145. There was a red brick-like stone found near there with a possible flat surface on one side.   There are some more rocks under L1032 so there is no mud-brick there. Probably it was a surface with all pebbles. But we took a soil sample from the surface. The surface is the rocks we are uncovering.   In the Southwest corner we are searching hard to find the mud-brick from the spot we took L1012 off. In L1032 we found a bunch of rocks. As we try to level it to the rocks, the soil is more dirty and choppy, a bit more red. It will be hard to level because it is loose. We will take L1022 down 5cm to level it to L1009. There seems to be no more rocks under the line formed between L1011 and L1021.   We are now leveling L1032 and there are more rocks under it. We think the soil is more silt. North of L1011 next to the East baulk, we found some rocks, and the sand around the rocks are darker like ash. In this layer (L1032) there are a lot of pebbles. We are cleaning the trench.   There is reddish stuff in the West side of the rocks that we found today (In the North of the wall L1011). They look like bricks.   We dropped L1031 in the Northeast corner by 10cm. There are many pebbles in that area. The rocks stretching Southeast from L1026 are disconnected with the walls on the East baulk. We are sweeping L1024/L1023 clean for a photo.

Phil has gone to work with Jakob in B1-3 and then to his own trench. Brian has come to this trench to do an intensive search for mudbrick lines in L-2013.      We took closing elevations for August 2 this morning. It was too windy to hold the level straigt on the second. We were gone the third and fourth for lab and rest days respectively.      Brian and I spent the time until breakfast scraping L-2013. We are trying to find good lines to create a continuous wall connected to the mud bricks in L-2018. L-2013 is a few centimeters higher than the developing wall in L-2018 so most of the pre-breakfast time was focused on taking the elevation down so that continuous lines would be recognizeable.      The post-breakfast scraping was fruitless. We concluded that L-2013 was still too high and the lines were covered with slump. We had the workmen hand pick a few centimeters deeper.      We removed the pot smash in L-2016. The elevations in the notebooks look odd, but they are correct. The first piece removed was a sherd standing on its edge, KT 2102. The top elevation was originally taken from this top edge because it was assumed that it was just one big, nice sherd. As we dug we found the other lower pieces which had an elevation of 95.76, KT 2024. As the area around the wall decreased in elevation we were able to remove the remaining sherds.      Brian continued looking for lines in L-2013. I began scraping L-2020 in the hopes that we could find lines which would connect it perpendicularly to L-2013.

We need to re-photo the trench for our trench plan, take elevations for our day plan and tag the loci in the east section of the trench. Hopefully we will accomplish this in a few hours and be able to remove the mudbricks in L2014 and L2016. We would like to continue to excavate down to the yellowish-green structural layer. If it is a mudbrick type we should see some symmetry. Perhaps it will follow the orientation of the existing mudbrick walls. It looks as though it follows L2023 and is found closely associated with L2014.   Michealle is a guest today. We spent a lot of time plumb bobbing strategies sections of the trench for the plan so that Drew has reference points. After about an hour of that we tagged the stratigraphic layers in the east baulk with very large nails. The trench now looks like a garage sale when there is nothing left to sell out the tables. Bradley/Andy asked us to photograph the phases of the mudbrick walls, another hour or so of inactivity.   finally after all that we were able to chop 3 courses off the wall in L2014 on the east side. It was a cathartic experience. There is now a pile of 3000 year old mudbrick rubble on the floor.   Tomorrow we will finish closing L2014 and L2016 as well as begin the search for more mudbrick in the south of L2032 and the floor of L2015.     ,~: C-2-2000-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2014,"58,2000-08-05," B-1-2000-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1008,","   8/5/2000   Started the day with a new man in the trench, Michaelle had been rotated out, and now I have Phil to deal with... The first thing I did was to lable the semi-circle of stones along the North baulk L. 1024, this should have been done days ago.........   Then we had one of the workmen level L.1023, while we measured in the part of L.1008, we were going to cut away, to do further study of the strata. Especially the relations between the foundation and the floor layers. This cut was labled L.1025.   After breakfirst Jakob had stomach-cramps and had to retreat from the site.   The work in B3 was continued by Aziz, after which he helped in cleaning L.1023, while Phil excavated L.1025, and leveled it with L.1021. Taner Re-cleaned L. 1022, which had been filled with dust during the 8/3, storm. At this point Aziz made fun of Phils Turkish skills.   While scraping down L.1023, we came upon a pit in the NW corner of the trench. The soil is very dark and ashy, and very soft.

While leveling L. 3005 we came upon a flat cirkular stone (KT#3023), which migth be a grinding stone. Apart from this stone we uncovered pottery and bones all over the locus (KT# 3021 and 3022).When we were cleaning Locus 3005 we came upon a yellowish soil type at the bottom (in the southern end of the trench). After cleaning we took final elevations for the entire trench. No work was done after this, because of a stomach ache........ But the trench is now closed for this season.

Basically I am excavating the NE corner of the trench. We will excavate every 25 cm and call it a level. The main aim is to see what is below, so I will try not to take much time on this. But, I will still pay my attention not to blow off some walls!   Level 1Since the slope is steep, I decided to create an arbitrary leveled surface and call it a level 1. I did not excavte much in East side, since West side was about 1 m higher. We found many broken pot-sherds, and lithics. This level is just a disturbance zone, washed from the slope above.    Level 2I suppose to excavte 25 cm, but luckly? I found a possible surface. I decided to stop excavting further and call it a level 2. (excavted about 10 cm feom the end of level 1). Befire reaching the surface, I found concentration of large rocks (about 5 - 10 cm in diameter, mostly round), randomly placed. Right below that rabble, we found a surface. The surface is very loose, even brushing makes things dirty! We tried to clean the surface, but all we did was to blow more soil up into the air and around. The surface contained small pebbells and flat-lying sherds. The soil was fine-sand and gray to white in color. On the surface, we found a large piece of what it seems to be a leg of a large pot. I took it up as a small find. the pot-sherds seems to be from a Hellenistic period. We will excavte 25 cm from this level tomorrow, if it is possible, I want to finish 2 or 3 levels a day.      Aug 7, 2000   Level 3we bashed the surface of level 2. Found few large rocks and just excessive amounts of pot-sherds. We found a possible mud-brick wall against the west balk, but the line was not clear. In Southwest corner, the compacted mud was lined against soft sandy soil, but in north, the line became invisible. I decided to bash through. I kind of hesitated, but since this is not a regular trench, it is better to go deeper. It turned out to be a wall laying below that possible mud-brick, which is in level 4   Level 4We found stone lined wall. The stones were all layed flat. It was approximately 15-20 cm in length, for each stone. we took a photo and I wrote a plan for the wall (rough sketch). Found more and more pottery, and several large rocks. These rocks could be from a collapse layer. As in the case of trench 1 I found several grind-stone and other worked stone. Since there is a photo record, I will dig this wall, but keep it for a level or two to see if the wall continues down further.      Aug 8, 2000   Level 5Today, we only completed one level.... Tomorrow, I am planning to excavate as much as we could. This morning, I decided to keep the wall at the West corner and dig around it to see if the wall extends downward and show any surface. As soon as we start excavating, we found a surface with pebbles and flat-lying sherds. It was a definate surface as in the case with the level 2. we exposed rest of the surface and seems to show several different types of cultural surface. We took a plannable photo-shot and I draw a quick sketch of the plan, but I will try to explain here. If you stand on the South balk and look towards North, this is what you will see: From West(Left), there is a wall (from level 4). This wall was made from lining the flat-stone, about 15 - 20 cm long. About 5 or 6 rocks are placed in line, running N-S, slightly tilted to East. Next, there are some rocks, similar to the wall, are placed below the wall. About3 or 4 rocks on south side. Actually, this is hard to explain. Basically, There seems to be a two lines of large rocks running N-S, and in between those lining of rocks, the surface is covered with small stones of about less than 5 cm in diameter. This surface is tightly layed with rocks. Phill told we that it was similar to the steps at Hasan Kayf. it certainly does. Or, it could be a passway. Just north of these tight layed rocks layer is a pebbled surface. East half is somewhat covered with hard compacted soil that we seeing all over the site. I am not sure the wall from the previous level has any connection to this surface. After taking photos and draw a plan, I decided to take away the wall from Level 4. KT 3026 and KT 3027 came out from below the wall. We will dig down tomorrow, destroy this beautiful surface. The mission is to reache the Uruk surface! It's kind of strange to see nothing on my 4 m x 4 m trench, but so far we had two definate surfaces on 2 m x 2 m. Archaeology rely on chance.      Aug 9, 2000   Level 6Because I only excavated one level yesterday, I really wanted to dig 2 leveles today; and I did! We removed the larger pebbles between the large linin of rocks, and we found a pebbled later right below them. I am not sure that all the small pebbled layer were covered by larger pebbles, or only half of the small pebbles were covered by large pebbles. After removing some large rocks that were lined, we found more rocks, in two rows. Both, East and west lining of rocks had two rows below one row of rocks. In section (that is E-W section) you will probably see rocks placed in triangle, two rocks at the bottom and one rocks at the top. You will see two of the triangle, East and west, and in between them, the small pebbles are layed, up to on third the triangle, and larger pebbles (5 cm in diameter) above this. We dug about 5 cm or so, and find these two lining of rocks. I removed the first layer. Since this was the same structure, I thought about not calling it a level, but I closed level 6 at this point (where I found the two two-rows of lining rocks). We took a photo, I draw a brief sketch of it, and we dug deeper! Probably Level #5 and Level #6 could go together.   About KT 3029, this strange brick was sticking out from the balk at the SE corner. At one point this brick became unstable and fell down to the trench. This brick was concave, I do not know which level that it came from, and it is too close to the surface and not worth noting the elevation (I think) but it is worth saving.   Level 7We took the pebble and rock surface (or pathway/ steps?); excavated fair amount of soil, and here comes another surface. This surface looks similar to that of Level# 2. There are many flat laying sherds, some rocks and pebbles. The soil is loose and sandy, somewhat ashy? It seems this level is still in the Hellenistic phase. I am not sure why there is so many surface in this trench!      Aug 10, 2000   Level 8I am writing this  on the 11th day of August, because we went to Mardin for a weekend-trip. So, my memory is one day old, and I am little bit tired, but I think it is better than writing the  tomorrow. We begin scraping off the surface that we found yesterday, hoping not to find new surface of the Hellenistic age. However, there were another surface right below the surface above. This surface is only about 3 cm below, and this indicate that this area was heavily occupied for relatively long period of time. Some readings from the elevation seems little strange (elevation of the lower level are higher than the level above), becaue we dug only 1 cm or so, and took elevation from different point. Also, the surface was far from being flat. On this surface, the possible wall appeared on the East side of the trench. This wall? looks similar to that from the previous levels. It is allinged on same diretion, same sizes of rocks, similar way of lining (2 line), and almost exactly the same location. All of these levels seems to be related, but level #7 did not have the rocks (wall or a path-way) It was covered with compacted mud, and had only few pottery. The line of compacted mud was visible at this level (7). Probably I was lucky (or unlucky) enough to find the level where there were no rocks. Now, I found the first row of rocks, whihch was single row, and directly below was a two lined wall. It had a little space after that (Level 7), covered with compacted mud, and another 2 rows of rocks were layed below that. West side of this wall was covered with occupational debries, and multiple layer of surfaces were uncovered. At this point we decided to make this sounding an official trench. Now, I have to be more careful about the excavation. I will give a locus number and this small trench will be dealt as regular trench.   Since we finding multiple layer of surfaces, I assigned this surface as Locus 3000, and the possible wall as 3001. I wil excavate the inside of the wall (West-side) first to see if this wall continues further down or not. We start excavating the Locus 3000, but we did not excavate that much today. Wait for the result from tomorrow.      Aug 12, 2000   Locus 3000Excavated few cm to expose another surface. Still, it is the same surface. Someone excavated NE corner little deeper than the other area. Looking at that pit, it seems that there are still more surfaces to come below. We made the surface flat, and took a photo, and closed the Locus 3000. I wonder why there are this many surfaces on top of each other. Some pot-sherds looked somewhat different than before. Most of the pot-sherds were well fired and the cut had a uniform color in general. However, I found some sherds with black color in fresh break. Well, we must wait for the pottery rading to be sure.    Locus 3002This is the Locus below 3000, which is another surface. there is another surface below, with many sherds. There were some round rocks below the surface of 3000. There could be some space of time between these levels, but I am not sure at this moment. Since we (area D) lost two best workers, today was a slow day. Hope we can get better workers tomorrrow. A guy that worked in this trench was lazy and did not do much. Maybe I should be pushing them harder.      Aug 13, 2000   Locus 3002We did not work in D3 this morning since I sent them to work on D1. But after a while, I sent one workman back to scrape the surface a little bit and brushed the surface. We found another surface (as usual), and closed this Locus. Took a photo and continue to push down on the next level (Locus 3003). I should clean Locus 3001 (Wall), and try to see the relationship between the wall and the surface. There could be another layer of rocks, so we must look careful. We also strightened the balk. I gave KT 3058 (pottery), and KT 3060 (lithic). There were many body-sherds, and it was out of context. I thought about keeping them all, but I tried to keep all the diag and large sherds, but tossed the body sherds away.   Locus 3003The surface of this Locus seemed different than the surfaces above. This surface had less pebbles, but some in West side of the surface. There seems to be more sherd than other surfaces, but I am not definate on this point. The soil was more compacted, and more silt like than sand. Also, the soil was somewhat brownish. I am not sure, but this could mean that there were time laps between the previous surface and the surface below. Finish excavating this level.          TRENCH SUMMARY OF AREA D TRENCH 3      The area D is located on the east side of the tell below a steep slope. We have chosen this area since there was a small flat area like a hump on a hillside. Our aim was to find an earlier occupational levels. The trench 3 was originally started out as a sournding. The purpose was to see the stratigraphoc information of this area; we decided to excavate 2 m x 2m trench and 25 cm arbitrary levels, unless we find some definate cultural level. However, we did not achieve the original goal but we found more than what we expected. In this small trench, we found multiple layers of surfaces, all dates to Hellenistic in age. Most surfaces were concealed and not disturbed and perfectly preserved Hellenistic rock constructed wall and possible pathway. We had to abandon the original plan as a sournding and convert into a regular trench. For next year, we may expend this into a full trench and see the Hellenistic architecture and surfaces.   Level 1 (87.89 - 87.09) Because of a steep slope, the differenes in the elevation of the biginning surfaces from west to east were about 80 cm. I decided to level this trench into a flat surface and try to excavate from there on.   Level 2 (87.09 - 87.01) After making a flat surface, we began excavting. Only few cm below, we found a surface, which contained small pebbles and flat sherds. Several large rocks of about 10 cm were above the surface.    Level 3 (87.01 - 86.88) The surface was very sandy, but compacted (by pressure?) Found many pot-sherds below the surface. Found a possible mud-bricks (or just a hard-compcted latyer of mud) near the west wall, oriented towards Northeast. It was probably not a mud-brick since I could not find ant definate line.    Level 4 (86.88 - 86.71) Below the mud-brick, I found a line of rocks. Seems to be a foundation for the mud-brick wall, or people put compcted mud above the rocks. Found some large rocks within this levels, probably from collapse. Also, many worked stone, such as grind-stones were found.   Level 5 (86.71 - 86.67) Decided to leave the rocks for now and excavte the east side of the wall. Few cm below, there was another line of stones at the East side of the trench, parralleling to the one in West. Inbetween theses lines of rocks, there was a pebbled/small rock surface. There were not many flat sherds, and seemed like a path. Large pebbles, the size of approximately 5 cm were placed.   Level 6 (86.67 - 86.52) I removed the line of rocks and found two lines of rocks on each side. Between them was another surface. The surface is consisted of flat-sherds, pebbles, and sandy soil.   Level 7 (86.52 - 86.37) Another surface which is very simiar to that of level above. It seems that all these layers of surfaces were occupied relatively in close time range and heavily occupied. I removed the wall and found another lines of rocks just below it. It seems that these rocks (wall) were continuous. However, the wall at the West side disappered. The rocks at the west side were placed like a triangle. But on the east side, there is one more line below the triangle. This wall has not been excavated yet.    Level 8 (86.37 - 86.35) This is another surface level. At this point, we decided to excavate this trench as same as regular trench. So, the next level wil be Locus 3000 (surface) and the Locus 3001 (wall).   Locus 3000The surface apperars exacly as same surface as other levels. Small pebbles of about 5 mm to 1 cm, and some larger rocks are present. Many flat laying sherds are everywhere in this trench.    Locus 3001This Locus is the two line of rocks on the East side of the trench. I did not excavte this Locus. Hopefully excavte next season.   Locus 3002This is another surface, with grey-white colored soil, fine sand with pebbles. The pottery from this level is all good Hellenistic context.    Locus 3003This Locus is another surface. However, this seems to be slightly different surace than before. Soil were more compacted and silt like. Also, soil seems to be more brownish in color and more fine grain(silt) than fine sand. could represent different ocuupational time, but at this point, it is hard to define any time periods to these surfaces other than saying it is in Hellenistic age.

Michaelle articulated the fill layer of the pit (a dark silt charcoal) and has arrived at a rock-pottery-bone layer. It looks strikingly similar to L2022. We will photo it and continue to dig it.   We are also digging the rest of L2033. It looks as though it spills out into L2032 shallowly.   L2012 continues under our mudbrick wall L2016 so we are sectioning L2016 to see what came first, the pit or the wall. It looks like the pit cuts into a second course of wall so we are moving cautiously to see what comes first. After some digging, it looks as though the pit L2012 continues under the mudbrick wall L2016. L2016 also contains a semi-course of mudbrick under the more definite bricks. This could be a mudbrick \mortar\ laid over the pit to hold the bricks in place.   We also excavated L2024 down to the present level of the western half of the trench. Nothing new was found in that loci except a few more large stones. They may be associated with the stones found along the west side of L2023.   After excavation of L2034 and finding a stone that looks to be a partial door post resting atop the layer of plaster and packed stones and pottery that this could have been a door post. We will trowel around that area to see what kinds of things are associated with this locus. We will not finish excavating this locus until we bring down the surrounding locus L2032 because of the hardness of the pit surface and its depth.   We also found a pit located in the east baulk on the north side and partially under L2035 (the fill under L2014 - the mudbrick wall). This pit is called L2036. It contained very little artifacts but was filled with an extremely fine white ash. We did not completely excavate this pit as time ran out.   Tomorrow we will finish with the pits L2034 and L2036. We will also dig the large fills L2032 and a currently unnamed locus on the west side of the trench to see if our north south mudbrick wall L2023 continues to have courses beneath it.     ,~: C-2-2000-08-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2014,"62,2000-08-06," C-1-2000-08-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1009,","   August 6, 2000      We are digging the pits L1023/L1024. And the soil in the pit L1024 is really hard although it is soft in L1023. We screened and took soil samples from both of them. Peter thinks that he sees a line in the baulk. \A mud-brick line\, he started dreaming about mud-brick (!) We found reddish stuff with white pieces under both pits (same material as in L1010). We found a square shaped rock and we put that into the lithics bag. Around the rocks in L1033, the soil is dark and silty. Probably it contians ash. It seems only to be on top of the flat square rocks.   We cleaned out some more of L1031 to level it with L1032. We are looking for a connection between L1026 and L1036. There are a lot of pebbles in the Northeast corner, but they don't seem to form a surface.   We dug L1032 East of L1034 between L1033 and L1036. We found a piece of pottery with ash on the inside and a burned surface. I also poked around in L1033 at the loose, dark silt.   Elvan started to articulate rocks in L1011 heading East. She took pottery off of the wall. There seems to be a straight line of rocks crossing from L1026 to L1036. L1031 is on the North side, L1032 on the South.   L1031 is turning up some very good lithics. We think it is a separate pit. L1026 seems to have a box and a possible flat surface for work. L1036 could be the same. I screened and took a soil sample from L1031 and screened L1032.   A lot of small pieces are coming up in the Northeast corner. We will probably change L1032 out. We are dropping the Northwest corner 10cm in L1025. We took some basalt from L1019 which was hanging out over L1025 and kt'd 1181. There was also a nice rim we put into the pottery bag. We are articulating L1036 and we will continue around to try to get a photo.        ,~: C-1-2000-08-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1009,"63,2000-08-06," D-2-2000-08-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   August 6, 2000      Today I am started a new trench in Area D, on the east slope of Kenan Tepe. Randy is in the next trench over, Trench 1, and is also responsible for Trench 3, a 2x2 sounding adjoining Trench 1 to the west. I am in Trench 2, which is directly to the North of Trench 1.       At the start of the day, Randy and I took elevations for all three trenches, and then spent some time rounding up workmen and tools. After that task was more or less completed, I had my workmen dig approximately 15 cm throughout the trench in order to clear out the layer of topsoil.       While cleaning up L 2000, 2 chunks of basalt were discovered. KT 2003, in the SW quadrant of the trench, was a flat stone with a central hole. Though not complete, it appears to be some kind of weight. KT 2004 was found in the NW corner of the trench, and is a fragment of a grindstone.      After all the dirt from L 2000 was removed, I decided to start the process of levelling the trench by opening a new locus below L 2000 and digging in the eastern half. L 2001 will be dug so that everything will be even with the lowest point, which is located in the NE corner.       We continued digging this locus until the end of the day. Large amounts of pottery, several small finds, and one scorpion were found in L 2001, which consists of very loose, crumbly soil with coarse granules. Among the more interesting of the small finds was a large stone in the S balk, which appeared to be a complete, non basalt grindstone. It was large and heavy.      Another interesting object was found at the end of the day near the middle of the trench. It appeared to be a kind of concrete mixed with large pebbles. Andy says that it is a naturally forming concrete-like substance known as river conglomerate.

This was followed by more scraping after a fight with Jakob because he sent his worker minion over to our trench to steal our trowels. It turned out to be a moot point because we sent our workers away to help open the new trenches.      I also shot 2 closing elevation points for yesterday. They looked obviously wrong. I think I misheard when the number was originally shouted out. The new numbers fit correctly.      Brian has pulled up some good lines in the western half and central area of L-2013. I'm still working on L-2020. I've handpicked about 3cm because it is above the level that the lines appeared in L-2013.      I decided to make the mudbricks in the east their own locus. They do not exactly match the wall that is L-2013.

Basically I am excavating the NE corner of the trench. We will excavate every 25 cm and call it a level. The main aim is to see what is below, so I will try not to take much time on this. But, I will still pay my attention not to blow off some walls!   Level 1Since the slope is steep, I decided to create an arbitrary leveled surface and call it a level 1. I did not excavte much in East side, since West side was about 1 m higher. We found many broken pot-sherds, and lithics. This level is just a disturbance zone, washed from the slope above.    Level 2I suppose to excavte 25 cm, but luckly? I found a possible surface. I decided to stop excavting further and call it a level 2. (excavted about 10 cm feom the end of level 1). Befire reaching the surface, I found concentration of large rocks (about 5 - 10 cm in diameter, mostly round), randomly placed. Right below that rabble, we found a surface. The surface is very loose, even brushing makes things dirty! We tried to clean the surface, but all we did was to blow more soil up into the air and around. The surface contained small pebbells and flat-lying sherds. The soil was fine-sand and gray to white in color. On the surface, we found a large piece of what it seems to be a leg of a large pot. I took it up as a small find. the pot-sherds seems to be from a Hellenistic period. We will excavte 25 cm from this level tomorrow, if it is possible, I want to finish 2 or 3 levels a day.        ,~: D-3-2000-08-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 3/Locus 3004,"66,2000-08-06," B-1-2000-08-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1008,","   8/6/2000   Today I was given the complete command over this trench and its two workmen Aziz and Taner, unfortunatly I had to give Ali to another trench.   Started the day by taking elevations. After which decided to close L.1024, by removing the stones. There by opening a new L.1029, which is the dirt between the stones and the bottom level of L.1023. Found some pottery with this soil (KT# 1139).   Then had 2 new loci created, both with objective to find the\floors\ as seen in the Loci L.1022 and L.1026, which I closed at the same time. Then had the workmen dig the 20 cm it would take.   Soon discovered that there were no floors/surface, and the color difference between the two parts of the trench still is there. The 2 loci were L.1027, which is below L.1023, and L.1028, which is below L.1021.

We got through the very white ash layer and beneath that (immediately beneath) was found some broken long bones (in very small pieces) and a tooth ( a very thick incisor), and a bead. We logged the bead as a small find. The tooth looks more animal than human, so I am assuming this is still an animal deposit.   We also lowered L2032 significantly. This is the fill on the east side of the trench surrounding the pits on the east baulk and the wall L2023 which bisects the trench.   directly beneath L2015 we were able to articulate another mudbrick wall or surface that runs almost parallel to L2023 called L2037. there is another mudbrick on the northeast corner of the trench called L2038. The space in between L2037 and L2038 looks also to be mudbrick. A mudbrick network is arising.   We dug L2032 down about 20 cm and it is spotted with 2 small pits on its west side. these pits look insignificant, but will be removed with caution. We are now digging a new locus L2039 which is the fill to the south of a small reddish colored mudbrick wall L2040. L2039 is located to the north of the pits on the south baulk (L2022 and L2033). We will excavate it about 20 cm lower that its present level. My overarching plan is to remove enough soil on the east side of the trench so that the east and the west sides are approximately the same elevation. once that has been accomplished with will examine both sides together.   We lowered L2028 another 15 cm and found a small metal band. Quite interesting though it was found in an ash pit.   We lowered L2039 about 20 cm and found nothing significant except an additional mudbrick in the wall L2040.   We finished the day excavating 5 cm from a new locus L2041.

She has moved to area F. We have a new worker, Ramazan. We are cleaning out all the old rocks, almost all the loci will disappear today. We chopped into L1021 and L1011 first, and took apart the smaller L1027. Our goal is to level the trench, so only the big rocks found yesterday in the Northeast corner are showing.   The rocks of L1021 used to form the rings around the pits L1023, L1024. There are many nice rocks in L1011. I found a lot of rocks which have been worked. There is also a lot of pottery. It is amazing how much stuff they seem to have reused. There were a lot of rocks worth saving so I had to open two bags.   I will open a new kt for anything directly under L1011. The wall didn't go all that deep. Maybe 3 courses at most on the uphill (East) side, but tappered down West.   Now I will cut down L1019. The tent just ripped a meter off the West side. What a day. As Chuck points out, \I lost my tent, my rocks, and my woman all in one day.\ It is one of those days. We are removing the West half of L1026. I have seen ash in some dirt after we cleaned L1026. Also under L1021 there is a potentially more dark surface which may be a burnt surface.   Finally we took the big rock out of L1022 and leveled that. Also, what was left of L1025 at the level of L1024, I cut down and screened half of it.   Then we swept clean and looked at our new flat floor. I took elevations and measured a bunch of new loci.   The day is going very late because a 60 Minutes team of reporters and photographers are here. We will start to dig our new loci, L1044, the East part.

Now concentrating on the west half of the trench. In this west side, we found more pottery. lithics, and bones. Especially, we found many worked stones. I found a stone bowl (mortar), and stone fish-net weight?(circular grind-stone with hole in the center. Also, several flat, rectangular round edged stones. I do not know why we are getting these materials from this level. pottery seems to be Hellenistic in nature, but lithics and other finds looks like a neolithic site. there were some soil variation in the locus. Andy thinks it is just a baked surface since it is too close to the surface. We have been seeing the same soil everywhere in this site, the hard compacted silt-like soil (almost like a mud-brick). I took out the pot-smash as oone KT number (KT 1011). I decided to close this locus; no definate reason to close, I am seeing some soil variation and it might be a good sign for getting close to the surface.   Locus 1001This locus is the west halsf of the trench. The purpose is to level the entire trench into flat surface. But if we find something, I will close a locus and make a different locus. Basically, the materials that coming out from this locus is same as locus 1000. Many grind0stones and pottery. I found several large rocks, especially concetrarted arond South side of the locus. Later, we found out that there was a stone lined wall sticking out from the West balk. This wall sticks out from the balk for about 30 cm and it ends there. It probably the end of the wall. This wall is made by piling up stones about 3 or 4 rows. It is only a small portion that is exposed at this moment, so I must clean it up tomorrow and see what is the relationship withe the surface that I am seeing now.

And they are carved also or turtle bones. But I have no idea about the bones. (L3000, kt#3002) ( After we show them to Chiara now we are sure that they are turtle bones) They are at the NW quarter of the trench near to the center.    We found a teeth at the S side of the trench also.   The top soil has a brown reddish color.It is loose and we found more bones of the turtlebut I don't want to screen the top soil for the smaler bones. the location of the bones are; 1.80 meters from the W baulk and 1.90 meters from the N baulk.    L3000 is a fill which is the top-soil. Coarse sand mixed withsilt, semi-loose, brown &amp; reddish with roots.   After cleaning the dirt I will change the locus number. But I think we are at the same level, sme material. Bt because of the sun, it is really hard to identifycolor changes. Tomarrow morning I will check the section again and i will be sure then.    After we dig we could not finish the whole trench and the NE side is still higher. We couldn't level the trench very well also because the workers are so tired.              ,~: F-3-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 3/Locus 3000,"71,2000-08-07," F-1-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1000,","   August 7, 2000      I began by digging 10cm in L1000 which was top soil. That was too cautious it seems to be all top soil, so I told them to dig another 10cm.    At 20cm we came upon a lighter grey soil that was harder packed with finer grain. Most likely this is just sub top soil but I changed locus anyway to L1001. I dug another 20cm down finding some large and beautiful possibly Hellenistic pot sherds in the North East corner of the trench.    Andy came by to warn us that we were digging in a heavily plowed zone, which would account for the mixed soil and the presence of modern debris.    There are two large roots at the North Baulk and North East area.   After going 20cm down L1001 we saw some soil that was a darker reddish brown and was a finer grain. I changed locus again to L1002 and decided to go down another 20cm looking for more stuff.   Unfortunately when I made this decision I didn't realize that it was so late in the day, so I just had everyone clean up the trench. All the KT#1006-1008 have been canceled. While cleaning the workers found a very small piece of jewelry with some bluish/green paint on it. I labled it a small find.

The soil remains the same coarse granule texture, and it seems likely that we are still digging through a topsoil/wash layer from further up the hill. We are going to try to level the trench N/S first, and then work from there.      After quite a bit of digging, we finally started finding some harder soil in the deepest part of the trench, that is near the center of the trench along the S balk. Andy came by and we decided to start digging in the western half of 2001, starting with a section on the north side of the trench.      Very shortly after we had started digging this section, the workmen uncovered a very nice cylinder seal, depicting on the side that wasn't covered with dirt a man fighting a lion. Also in this area was found a large donut shaped basalt weight.      The rest of the day was spent cleaning the sections, and removing all the dirt that was dug today. There remains some work to do tomorrow to level the area dug in the western half of the trench with that in the eastern half.     ,~: D-2-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2001,"73,2000-08-07," F-2-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2000,","   August 7, 2000   We opened up Area F today. After taking initial elevations I told the workers to dig 20 cms for L2000. Digging was slow at first because we only had two wheelbarrows for three trenches. In addition to that I only had two workers because some of them were commandeered to dig a cut into the east side of the tepe.   The soil at this level is topsoil fill. It is brownish gray in color. The terrain is maked by plow furrows.   We just found out that \60 Minutes\ is coming.   After digging down 20 cms I noticed that the soil seemed redder and softer. Because of this I closed L2000 and opened a new locus, L2001. As of yet there are no indications of anything special. Tomorrow I may split the trench in half and stagger it so I have a section to see what is going on.              ,~: F-2-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2000,"74,2000-08-07," D-3-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 3/Locus 3006,","   Aug 7, 2000   Level 3we bashed the surface of level 2. Found few large rocks and just excessive amounts of pot-sherds. We found a possible mud-brick wall against the west balk, but the line was not clear. In Southwest corner, the compacted mud was lined against soft sandy soil, but in north, the line became invisible. I decided to bash through. I kind of hesitated, but since this is not a regular trench, it is better to go deeper. It turned out to be a wall laying below that possible mud-brick, which is in level 4   Level 4We found stone lined wall. The stones were all layed flat. It was approximately 15-20 cm in length, for each stone. we took a photo and I wrote a plan for the wall (rough sketch). Found more and more pottery, and several large rocks. These rocks could be from a collapse layer. As in the case of trench 1 I found several grind-stone and other worked stone. Since there is a photo record, I will dig this wall, but keep it for a level or two to see if the wall continues down further.        ,~: D-3-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 3/Locus 3006,"75,2000-08-07," B-1-2000-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1008,","   8/7/2000   Due to total misunderstanding of notebook/dayplan system, I spent the morning remasuring the trench.

It looks as though there is some mudbrick on the north side of L2041 called L2044. After scraping and sweeping we definitely have mudbrick walls, probably a continuation of L2037 and L2038. Once we remove the north/south wall L2023 we should see L2044 and L2037 and L2038 connect.   While deciding how to approach L2023, our north/south mudbrick wall, we dig 10 cm lower in L2039. At the bottom of this locus we found a rock alignment following the southeast trend of L2040.   One of the biggest questions I had today was the nature of L2023, and if it had any relation to the mudbricks found in L2037 and L2038. I also wanted to know how many courses L2023 has. in order to answer this last question, I sectioned the wall into a new locus L2043 on the west side where the bricks were best exposed and found that L2023 has definitely 4 courses and perhaps 5. I suspect however that this fifth course is actually L2037 running underneath L2023. This because the color of this \course\ is the same as L2037.   Before this section L2043 was taken, however, I had a plan photo taken of L2023 knowing that it would be removed today.   I finally named the rock alignment found near the center of the trench (L2042) and took opening elevations.   At the bottom of the section L2043, we found another rock alignment running parallel to L2042 with 2 courses of mudbrick between them. This looks to be a continuation of L2037. When we remove L2023, we should see its relationship to the rest of the mudbricks in the trench.   After investigating the mortar lines of L2023 and L2037 I saw that they didn't match up and that L2023 runs more north/south proper and L2037 runs more in a north, northwest direction. Therefore L2023 looks to be a later phase of construction.   Finally, we began to remove L2023 and will finish that job tomorrow.     ,~: C-2-2000-08-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2022,"77,2000-08-08," D-1-2000-08-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1/Locus 1001,","   Aug 8, 2000   Locus 1001Today was kind of slow day. Anyway, we strated out by scraping and brushing the surface of the 1002 (end of 1001). when we were clearing, I found two posible pits, one at the Southest corner of the locus (south-central part of the trench) and another smaller pit at the North side, abuts to west balk. At this point I assigned a new locus (I had an idea to change the locus from yesterday..)    Locus 1002These pits had darker soil and loosely compacted (crumble). Also, soil was more sandy (fine sand). The hard compacted area is white and silt. Basically, about the same type of soil variation as in Area A trench 1, and possibly other areas. The pit was about 1 m to 1.5 m. Since this locus is still close to the surface, I decided not to make a new loci for these pits. However, I gave different KT numbers for the artifacts. (KT1033 KT1034 KT1035 KT1036). The pit were farly shallow, about 10 cm deep. Bottom of the pit was same as other compacted area. We took a photo after excavating the pits. I think these were just a deep area and disturbed zone. Now, all the soil in this locus looks all the same, except for the wall that sticking out from the west balk. I decided to take the locus down to the finishing level of the locus 1000 at the east side. we start bashing the soil from the south-side. Ihsan found some large rocks near the possible wall. I have not cleaned the area well, so I have to wait for tomorrow, but the rocks seems to be just a collapse. we did not find any large rocks on the East-side (locus 1000). About KT 1039, this was kind of wired find. It looks like a brick. But it could be a piece of pottery? It is kind of square in shape but curves up at the edge. Also, surface seem to be grinded down. It could be a pallet? It actually reminds me of the incense burner from Oman that was discovered in Oman. I don't know what it could be.   I'm not sure why today was unproductive day. Workers were complaining about the not having the tent, and we took about an hour or so to take a picture, and some other unknown factors. Maybe I got used to bashing 1 m a day for last two days, so I'm just feeling this way.     ,~: D-1-2000-08-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1/Locus 1001,"78,2000-08-08," C-1-2000-08-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1026,","   August 8, 2000      Archaeologists think I have too many loci, so I will redesign. We are digging L1044, which now includes most of the trench. Free loci numbers which now remain to be used: L1041, L1042, L1043. I found a watermelon seed in the Southwest, just above L1035 in the West baulk. This is the Southern most point of L1040. We dug 10cm across L1044, there were a lot of bones. We will dig another 15 cm. In the North part we seem to be happening upon a lot of bones, so we will carefully take this section and clean it. We will continue to go down on the South side.   After breakfast I dug a probe from the East into L1029 to see if the blue square is anything. We also dug L1044 down another 10cm. We start to hit pebbles on the East, but the center is still just dirt. I found a nice blade of obsidian on the South Baulk and I kt'd it as 1226.   The blue crust in L1029 is not very thick and has a lot of pebbles. It seems to continue North. It is only slightly below the level to which L1029 was cut, also the bottom of the wall. It may be a surface or the mortar between bricks. We cut it in half during the probe. No bricks yet. After the probe, we also dropped the North part of L1029 since we don't know what else to do. On the West of L1044 there seems to be another blue layer. It may be West of where the L1019 wall used to be.   The L1044 and L1029 blue sections can not as yet be connected. In the North part of L1044, there are more broken rocks and pottery. There maybe a line of rocks there, that leads Southwest from the center of the North Baulk, possibly related to the aforementioned L1044 West blue section.

While we were doing this, I noticed a distinct line in the section below which the soil was much darker. While it may have been due only to a higher moisture content, I am having the workmen dig only to this level from now on.      After the above mentioned area was cleared out, we began digging the south central part of L 2001 to the level of the soil change. Nothing eventful was found in this area, and after cleaning it up we moved to the northwest quadrant of the trench.      While digging the eastern half of this area, a partial basalt grindstone was found in the section between what we were digging and the are that was dug yesterday. Later, we encountered several large rocks that appeared to be associated with each other. After articulating the rocks somewhat and searching the area for more (without success, though we did find a network of scopion/gopher holes) I decided to dig the western part of the northwest quadrant only to the level of the top of the newly found rocks. However, roughly 10-15 cm down in this area, the workmen encountered what appeared to be a cobble surface, similar to the path Randy had found in the sounding D3.       We then decided to dig the southwestern quadrant of the trench to the level of the cobbles to see if they continued into this area. We dug 20 cm and did not discover a surface, just a few scattered cobbles. While it is possible that there may be more cobbles 10 cm or so lower, it seems most likely that the stones in the NW quadrant are just collapse from further up the hill. Nevertheless, we will continue to search a little bit more in the SW quadrant tomorrow.

If nothing shows up I may split the trench into east and west halves. I could stagger these by 5cm to help me get an idea of what is going on in the trench.   About 5mins into digging we found an oven in the middle of the trench. After consulting Andy I decided to go ahead with my plan to divide the trench in half. I will push the west half down another 5cms. Hopefully this will geve me a good section and help me find a surface for the oven.   Change of plan. I turned my back to do elevations and they started digging the east half of the trench. Here we found some bones, rocks, and pottery that could be a surface. Because of this we will peel back the eastern part and try to articulate a surface. It looks like I'll have to change my loci making L2002 the oven and L2003 the surface.   My workers are quite slow and often stand around. I'm tired of babysitting. Fortunately Andy brought Meki over to help me. I'm having him articulate the surface, L2003 and he's also going to work on the oven. Meanwhile the other three workers will dig the rest of the trench down level with the southeastern corner of the trench.   By the end of the day L2001 has been levelled while L2003 has been somewhat articulated.

Tomorrow, I am planning to excavate as much as we could. This morning, I decided to keep the wall at the West corner and dig around it to see if the wall extends downward and show any surface. As soon as we start excavating, we found a surface with pebbles and flat-lying sherds. It was a definate surface as in the case with the level 2. we exposed rest of the surface and seems to show several different types of cultural surface. We took a plannable photo-shot and I draw a quick sketch of the plan, but I will try to explain here. If you stand on the South balk and look towards North, this is what you will see: From West(Left), there is a wall (from level 4). This wall was made from lining the flat-stone, about 15 - 20 cm long. About 5 or 6 rocks are placed in line, running N-S, slightly tilted to East. Next, there are some rocks, similar to the wall, are placed below the wall. About3 or 4 rocks on south side. Actually, this is hard to explain. Basically, There seems to be a two lines of large rocks running N-S, and in between those lining of rocks, the surface is covered with small stones of about less than 5 cm in diameter. This surface is tightly layed with rocks. Phill told we that it was similar to the steps at Hasan Kayf. it certainly does. Or, it could be a passway. Just north of these tight layed rocks layer is a pebbled surface. East half is somewhat covered with hard compacted soil that we seeing all over the site. I am not sure the wall from the previous level has any connection to this surface. After taking photos and draw a plan, I decided to take away the wall from Level 4. KT 3026 and KT 3027 came out from below the wall. We will dig down tomorrow, destroy this beautiful surface. The mission is to reache the Uruk surface! It's kind of strange to see nothing on my 4 m x 4 m trench, but so far we had two definate surfaces on 2 m x 2 m.

We start by dropping, leveling the South side of L1029 where the blue corner used to be. I found a cute dog in the corner about 1.3m by 1.3m from the Northwest corner. I kt'd it as kt1238. It seemed to be aroudn a lot of bones. We have found some bones in this location and there is pottery on small rocks all around this area in the middle of the North part of the trench.   Things are starting to come out under L1038 is a wall of rocks heading Southwest. The corner may be formed with some rocks of L1039. The sheep figure maybe from the corner where pottery smashes and stones may indicate a surface. Under L1028 a line of rocks is coming up under where L1027 used to be. The most confusing spot and possibly most interesting is in the middle of the North. There may be a corner with the rocks.   We took a small carbon sample from the Northwest of the rocks of L1028. L1044 is almost all gone. I want to finish off this fill today. A piece of basalt was knocked out of the East baulk 40 cm up from the base.   After breakfast we cut down the lump remaining in the middle from L1029. On the South side there is some darker dirt which maybe an oven or something.   After sweeping L1029 clean, there is a line of blue stuff with large pot sherds. There is another line like an S, but there is no symmetry that would mean anything.   We cut down this section, it is split by the blue line L1037 on the West, L1034 on the East. We cut the Southwest corner of L1037 to find the edge of the cobbles below. We scraped L1034 to find more blue stuff ont he East side, it starts to uncover a possible extension of the rocks of L1033. We pulled a round stone from the cobbles, kt'd as 1261.

It was more like a 1/2 bucket and I was able to get a few scraps of bone out of it. I closed that locus yesterday but didn't have time to sift that last bucket.    The workers are now trying to level the trench on top of the rock/pebble surface which appears to be concentrated in the centre of the trench heading East to West. On the south side of the surface we are finding a very hard clay-like surface which may indicate a floor. We cleaned and measured the newly leveled surface then took a photo. We changed to the following locus numbers: L1005 is the fill North of the rock surface, L1006 is the rock surface, L1007 is the fill south of the rock surface. We began by digging a small sounding about 1/2 meter long at the western end of L1005.   Of course, while cleaning L1006 for phots we found yet another burial. It is lodged in the eastern baulk on top of the rock surface of L1006. There is a definite pit around the skeleton and the skull appears to be crushed. We have uncovered a lot of upper torso such as the ribs, skull, teeth, and arms. We articulated it as best we could then photographed it. Hopefully we'll box it tomorrow.    Meanwhile the sounding in L1005 was being dug about 5cm deep. We were trying to find the next layers of the rock surface in L1006 there appear to be few stones continuing, but that might just be tumble.    We also began digging in L1007 to see what was on the otherside of the rock surface where we found a very hard clay-like surface that felt suspiciously like mudbrick. The soil close to the baulk was a darker grey while the soil away from it was the same as the rest only it was harder packed and had orange and black spots indicating burnt clay. Bradley decided it wasn't a mudbrick and we chopped through it.

We removed the larger pebbles between the large linin of rocks, and we found a pebbled later right below them. I am not sure that all the small pebbled layer were covered by larger pebbles, or only half of the small pebbles were covered by large pebbles. After removing some large rocks that were lined, we found more rocks, in two rows. Both, East and west lining of rocks had two rows below one row of rocks. In section (that is E-W section) you will probably see rocks placed in triangle, two rocks at the bottom and one rocks at the top. You will see two of the triangle, East and west, and in between them, the small pebbles are layed, up to on third the triangle, and larger pebbles (5 cm in diameter) above this. We dug about 5 cm or so, and find these two lining of rocks. I removed the first layer. Since this was the same structure, I thought about not calling it a level, but I closed level 6 at this point (where I found the two two-rows of lining rocks). We took a photo, I draw a brief sketch of it, and we dug deeper! Probably Level #5 and Level #6 could go together.   About KT 3029, this strange brick was sticking out from the balk at the SE corner. At one point this brick became unstable and fell down to the trench. This brick was concave, I do not know which level that it came from, and it is too close to the surface and not worth noting the elevation (I think) but it is worth saving.   Level 7We took the pebble and rock surface (or pathway/ steps?); excavated fair amount of soil, and here comes another surface. This surface looks similar to that of Level# 2. There are many flat laying sherds, some rocks and pebbles. The soil is loose and sandy, somewhat ashy? It seems this level is still in the Hellenistic phase.

No surface was found, so L 2004 was closed, and the line of stones was removed as L 2003. This action completed, the entire raised area in the SW quadrant was dug as L 2005. While L 2005 was being dug, however, two potentially intersting areas were discovered. A pile of large stones was found in the northern section of the locus, and an area of very hard soil, with a few large stones, was found in the Southern part. Between these two areas, L 2005 was dug to the level of the soil change found on 8/8/2000.      The area was cleaned up and Drew took a photo. After Bradley had decided that the hard soil in the SW corner was just random debris, we dug that area as L 2007 down to the level of the soil change from 8/8. The pile of large stones was dug as L 2006. Nothing exciting was found in either of these loci except for a small chunk of basalt that popped up in L 2006.      After L 2006 was cleaned up, we moved on to dig the pile of stones in the NW corner, discovered yesterday, as L 2008. Another chunk of basalt was found here.       We then worked on cleaning the balks for a while, and after that was finished, the workers dug a little further in the eastern part of the trench.     ,~: D-2-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2001,"88,2000-08-10," C-2-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2022,","   10 August 2000   We began by cleaning and articulating L2045 and L2039, getting them ready for a photo, at same time we opened a new locus L2046, which is a cobblestone wall, beneath the fill, which consisted of the L2030, L2031 and L2040.    We then opened L2047, which is line of mudbrick running parallel to L2037, although on a lower level. It abuts L2037, L2041 and L2046.    After this we opened a third locus L2048, which is a stone wall below L2044, we can see 2 rows of large cobbles in 1 course along the north baulk, abutting L2041.   When we had done this, we agreed to remove L2022, very carefully, fearing that it could bring a large part of the south baulk down.    While searching for the precise border of L2038, CE found an area with burnt wood, you could almost see the grains in the wood/charcoal, this wood was below L2034.   Jakob suggests that the kiln / oven L2034 and L2036 the ash pit beside it are the same phase.    We think that the burnt wood in between them could have been used to feed the fires in the oven / kiln. We saved a great deal of the charcoal for a carbon sampling and we took a soil sample from the same area.   We are working on articulating mudbrick walls to the east of L2037. These are probably related or the same as L2047.   We closed L2039, because we have come down to a surface with a potsmash, cobbles and other pottery are lying flat. This surface is located south of L2046 a stone alignment.   By noon we uncovered another row of cobbles parallel to L2048 and we decided to extend L2048 to cover these stones, as they seem to be part of the same structure.     ,~: C-2-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2022,"89,2000-08-10," C-1-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1026,","   August 10, 2000      We have Lokman drop the Northwest corner L1038 to the current level of L1044. We are also cutting along the South baulk L1034 to get rid of it and level to L1034. We cut slowly here because there are a lot of rocks and some nice pottery.   We also leveled L1040, I will look for bricks in the baulk. We found something 1.25m from the South Baulk and 1.2 m from the EB. It is a piece of pottery with a hollow inside, shaped like a kettle or something. Then East of this there was a piece of an oven and a huge carbon sample 1.3m from the SB and 0.8m from the EB in L1034.    We continue to work L1034 down from the North. THe wormenare picking it over slowly. I also took a soil sample form the center.   Lots of action on the West baulk. We dropped L1038, L1040 in the morning. We cut a rectangle out of the circle that was L1035. That soil is very hard, but there doesn't seem to be any lines. No pottery inside- we found only one piece.   Well, we swept the West and there is a yellowish square. THere are two possible rows, one with larger, one smaller bricks. We then dug a little further East in L1038 towards L1039. We found a piece of Obsidian up against L1039 that was quite nice. There was only a few cm to clean up there. I will dig L1026 to take off the top. I will pick off one nice rock. We are also cutting L1044 from the South Baulk down 10cm to Elvan's street. We found a lot of big pig bones in the new L1044 cut.   In L1025 I had a thought- it might be part of the door threshold that connects Elvan's street to L1039. It might be the next step up. But I removed it already, the rocks could be connected, there is more fill under in the middle. But the rocks around the edges might be connected.     ,~: C-1-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1026,"90,2000-08-10," D-1-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1,","   Aug 10, 2000   Locus 1003I'm writing this jounal a day after the actual day of excavation since we went to the week-end trip. This is the first time I wrote the  day after... So, my description may contain some misleading remarks. I decided to remove as much dirt as possible today. As I mentioned above, this is the first time that the trench was leveled. We started excavating from the East side and dug all the way to the West side. The east side is still in sub-topsoil, but the west side could be in occupational level. after clearing the surface, there were gradual line, but definate difference between the soil from west to east. Conveniently, the soil seems to be divided just about 2 m line. It was probably not a good idea to combine the west side of the trench and the east side of the trench. After the bashing has fiished, I brushed the surface and see if there is any sign of occupation. On the NW cornaer and SW corner, the soil seemed very compacted; almost like a mud-brick, especially on the North side. The texture is silt, white-grey in color. In the central part of the West side, soil was somewhat loosely cimpacted, and had some pebbles within the soil. It also appeared brownish. The soil on the North and West did not had any pebbles. There was a definate difference in the soil (something is going on!). Some soil of the NW looked like a mud-brick. However, the bashing crew did a horrible job of making a flat surface, and I really could not tell what was going on. The surface had many bumps and low spots. I told them to make the West side more flat. Also, the West side was much higher than the Eat side. We finished our job for the day while flattening the West side. So, tomorrow, we will make the surface nice and flat, and see the surface. there might be a mud-brick surface! About the east side, I will divide the trench into half (I don't like digging with two completely different levels) and excavate it deeper. This is only my thought, but in the past, the area where my trench was the edge of the mound. All the east side is just piled up erosion layer. Dividing the trench seems like I am excavating two trenches in one trench; it will be more work!     ,~: D-1-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1,"91,2000-08-10," D-3-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 3/Locus 3000,","   Aug 10, 2000   Level 8I am writing this  on the 11th day of August, because we went to Mardin for a weekend-trip. So, my memory is one day old, and I am little bit tired, but I think it is better than writing the  tomorrow. We begin scraping off the surface that we found yesterday, hoping not to find new surface of the Hellenistic age. However, there were another surface right below the surface above. This surface is only about 3 cm below, and this indicate that this area was heavily occupied for relatively long period of time. Some readings from the elevation seems little strange (elevation of the lower level are higher than the level above), becaue we dug only 1 cm or so, and took elevation from different point. Also, the surface was far from being flat. On this surface, the possible wall appeared on the East side of the trench. This wall? looks similar to that from the previous levels. It is allinged on same diretion, same sizes of rocks, similar way of lining (2 line), and almost exactly the same location. All of these levels seems to be related, but level #7 did not have the rocks (wall or a path-way) It was covered with compacted mud, and had only few pottery. The line of compacted mud was visible at this level (7). Probably I was lucky (or unlucky) enough to find the level where there were no rocks. Now, I found the first row of rocks, whihch was single row, and directly below was a two lined wall. It had a little space after that (Level 7), covered with compacted mud, and another 2 rows of rocks were layed below that. West side of this wall was covered with occupational debries, and multiple layer of surfaces were uncovered. At this point we decided to make this sounding an official trench. Now, I have to be more careful about the excavation. I will give a locus number and this small trench will be dealt as regular trench.   Since we finding multiple layer of surfaces, I assigned this surface as Locus 3000, and the possible wall as 3001. I wil excavate the inside of the wall (West-side) first to see if this wall continues further down or not. We start excavating the Locus 3000, but we did not excavate that much today. Wait for the result from tomorrow.        ,~: D-3-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 3/Locus 3000,"92,2000-08-10," F-1-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1005,","   August 10, 2000      I checked my measurements for L1006 this morning, they seem to be fine. We only have 2 workmen today so I've set them both to digging in L1005 and L1007. I'm still trying to see what is under the rock surface by coming down another 5-10cm along either side of it. The burial in L1008 will stay as it is for now, hopefully Andy will help me take it up today. I want to cut a section out of rock surface today.   I spent the morning articulating the burial in L1008. We took up some bones and took some photos. About 10cm below the rock surface L1005 we came upon another rock surface. This surface is devoid of pottery/bone/cultural debris indicating that it might not have been made by humans. The pebbles and cobbles are smaller in size than the surface in L1006.    We cleaned and photographed the surface in L1005. We are now chopping a section in L1006 at its western end along the baulk to see if their new rock surface continues under the 1st rock surface.   L1008: The Burial   We found a small bone near the skull that was in the position a clavicle should be in but it is actually a broken ulna for a very young person. The rest look like they belong to one person but that particular bone screws things up. There are more bones still in the baulk.      ,~: F-1-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1005,"93,2000-08-10," F-2-2000-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2001,","   10 August 2000   Today I looked around the trench and noticed that the southern half was a different color than L2001 so I opened it up as a new locus, L2004. It is characterized by a grayish brown soil that is medium packed. In the northwest corner of the trench it appears that more of a surface is emerging. In that case I will expand L2003 so that it includes the entire surface of the northern part of the trench. I will have the workers push down L2004 by 5cms while I try to articulate L2003.

For today I am only digging the top-soil.We started with 20cm.    Our arbitrary datum heigt is 50 meters. For the first time The workers could go only 10cm so I told them 20 more.   After cleaning the dirt I will change the bags. There are no difference between the levels but I want to keep them as seperate.    We found some bones and theyare so thin. And they are carved also or turtle bones. But I have no idea about the bones. (L3000, kt#3002) ( After we show them to Chiara now we are sure that they are turtle bones) They are at the NW quarter of the trench near to the center.    We found a teeth at the S side of the trench also.   The top soil has a brown reddish color.It is loose and we found more bones of the turtlebut I don't want to screen the top soil for the smaler bones. the location of the bones are; 1.80 meters from the W baulk and 1.90 meters from the N baulk.    L3000 is a fill which is the top-soil. Coarse sand mixed withsilt, semi-loose, brown &amp; reddish with roots.   After cleaning the dirt I will change the locus number. But I think we are at the same level, sme material. Bt because of the sun, it is really hard to identifycolor changes. Tomarrow morning I will check the section again and i will be sure then.    After we dig we could not finish the whole trench and the NE side is still higher. We couldn't level the trench very well also because the workers are so tired.      August 9,2000      We will set the tent firstand we will dig the highe part at the NE corner of the trench. Then I will change the locus and continue digging. Probably I won't be here after breakfast so I will try to go as fast as possible. I gave them a pottery bag (KT#3004) (L3000)We are still digging in the plowed soil)   I closed L3000. About elevations: August 7th, the bottom elevation was 49.26 because the trench wasn't leveled. Still that part is the lowest part but now it looks like it is a hole in the ground so I m not considering that elevation anymore. Today the closing elevation is49.27 at the corner (Bottom elevation)   We started excavating L3001 sub top-soil. We started from the W side of the trench. It is also loose nd the workers are using shavels to dig. At the same time they are moving the dirt from the west side. We found some bones that should belong to a big animal.   I don't think we can dig the NE quarter today because I have to leave soon.   We decided bot to go to Diyarbakir so I am back. We leveled the trench and I closed L3001 because we are now on a more packed stuff. I want to remove it seperately. And there are some pebbles at these level also. So this level is L3002. We started from the SW corner. I cannot see easily because of the dirt now but there is some white material under it. There are a lot of white chuncks in this layer. But Icut a section in the middle and the white stuff doesn't form a line. I will level this layer and look for lines. Because thet seems alittle reddish also. Dirty. We started digging the N side of the locus 3002. It is the same with the South side. (white stuff) We are now leveling this part. We could not find anything yet.    We decided to dig a probein the corner of the trenchwe will continiuethat until we hitsomething. I decided to open that at teh NE corner of the trench. It willbe 1.5 meters by1.5 meters and it will be a new locus (L3003) so I am waiting for the level now. After I take elevations I will make the workers to dig that corner.    In the S side of the probe ther is a harder part that looks like mud brick and in the N side it is more reddish with that white stuff. They cut the section after they clean it I will lokk at there to see any lines. I don't think there is mud-brick there. I decided to go 20 cm moreso if there is something I will see it in the section.   We couldn't see anything in the section. So we are continiuing in that probe. Also we are not finding too many pot sherds. This trench has nothing yet.      August12,2000      We are still continiuing that probe. Still a very little amount of pottery there. I said them 25cm more but the soil is hard so they cannot do that much.   We decided to continiue tis as a sounding and I am moving to F1. After now we will have only levels in this probe. And we will leave a worker there.       We found a lot of ash in this sounding and a lot of hard soil above these ash and bones. In the soil above the ash tere weren't a lot of pottery or anything else that we started to think that this was virgin soil.      Trench Summary      This trench is at the lower mound of Kenan Tepe. The purpose to open this trench was to identify the earlier phases of the site. We started to remove top soil (L3000) and then we changed the locus to L3001 because we decided that we went too deep as a same layer but there was no change in the soil. Then we continiued digging and we started to find more pebbles but there weren't enough sherds on the L3002. The soil was plowed so it was hard to reach good contexts.So we decided to open a probe at the NE corner of the trench to identify the depth of these contexts(L1003) and we dug it as a seperate locus at the first days. But we couldn't find pottery in this probe except one or two pieces. Then, we decided to concentrate on the other trenches at the area F because we were finding alot of stuff there and there was nothing in the trench F3. So I moved to F1 and the probe continiued as a sounding. We couldn't find almost anything in the first layer of the sounding. But when we reached the end of the first layer we started to find some bones and the next layer was a surface probably. Then we started to find a lot of bones and alot of ash in this area in Layer 4 so we took 4 bags of soil sample then we understood that te bones were belonging to a geer antler. After this layer we continiued to find a lot of bones and more pottery than before. At the Layer 7th the ash was still continiuing.

Dug today in the south section of the trench--removed soil of L2032 finding very few bones, sherds, and lithics despite screening. Once L2032 was \flattened\ such that it became levvel with the area to its east, we switched locus number to L2034 and dug down 20-25cm. L2034 was hard packed, possibly mudbrick collapse with very few sherds, bones, lithics floating in the soil. We dug only the area south of the former divider/trough lines of L2024.      We also dug between the 9m and 10m pegs as L2035. We switched locus because we were no longer in the sub-topsoil that came above this area. We dug a total of 1m in depth in this area. We also straightened the baulks using a plumb bob all along the trench.       Today we assigned new Locus number 2036 to the mega-hard packed mudbricks adjacent to L2010 on the north side of that mudbrick wall (i.e., 2010). This area L2036 was formerly left standing as L2012 but we now realize that a new locus is necessary because the hard packed brick wall is a different entity than the softer mudbrick wall of L2012 to the north of L2036.     ,~: A-2-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2002,"96,2000-08-12," B-2-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2013,","   August 12, 2000      Drew came along and did an opening shot for L-2035. It is a pit in the north east corner of L-2030.      Had a fight about the good level stick. People will be pissed about this for a while.      Dug pit L-2035 20cm. Found some charcoal looking bits and had them contaminated by fingers. Opened L-2035 because it was looser soil. When swept it decreased in elevation creating a perimeter around the pit. There were areas of yellowish soil that looked like root or bone decomposition.      Chopped off half of L-2023 to look at the section. Didn't see anything. It comes out tomorrow.      Took a soil sample of L-2035, KT 2194.      Chopped 4cm into the north face of L-2013. We have to take some off to make it straight and look for brick lines. Also chopped into the west of L-2020.      Removed the hump of mud brick that extends off L-2029 into L-2030. The area under it was quite soft. We removed it to the level of the pit trying to get a section on the hard areas west of this.      There is a pit in L-2036 in the south west, cutting L-2026. It is much softer and browner than the surrounding areas. It also has some ash content. 20cm into this pit a pot smash came up, KT 2208. Drew came and photoed it.      Had Erdol dig 20cm in pit L-2034. I'm trying to remove it in preparation for a big push in that area to try and find the wall foundation.

The trench seems to be cut by something at the Southern part. And before I started writing, they took off L1006, the bigger rocks. There weren't many left when I came. Only in the Eastern part of the trench in the middle.   In the West corner of L1007, there is a harder part but I didn't change the locus, I will check it after digging 10cm more. Next to L1010 on the West there is a big rock between the pit and L1007 (actually in the pit L1010, Because the loose soil continiues around the rock.). We screened one bucket from the pit. There are some bones under the hard material in the Southwest corner. There was always hard material here, in this corner. I remember that they were talking about finding amud-brick in this area but theree were no lines and there aren't lines now so it might be mud-brick debris or a mud brick wash.    We found a skull in the Southern quarter of the trench next to the Westen baulk but when we were digging we broke it. Now we are waiting for Andy and screening.   Kt1053 of L1007 is the part from the possible burial but we didn't change locus yet so it will be part of L1007. After we found the burial we took 3 buckets of dirt but it is mixed with the soil from L1007. The burial will be L1011.

This time, workers did better job. We brushed and see the surface. There was a definate line between loose soil and compacted soil. East side is loose, gray, sub-topsoil. I draw a line following the division of this transition. I made the east side (loose, sub-topsoil) as locus 1004, and west side (compacted) as 1005. While the workers took down the 1004, I excavated (destroyed) the pile of rocks that was floating at the North balk, about 1 m from the west. This structure waas made from several flat rocks of about 2 -5 cm in thickness, and rounded, about 4 - 6 cm in diameter. There were several layer of this rocks, but not in particular order, but it was all layed flat. But few rocks were round, or layed sideways. This rock pile finished around 1002 and 1003 transition in profile, or little deeper. The soil had no significant difference, it was not a mud-bricjk or mortor. I found two pieces of teeth, probably horse in the rock pile. The soil around the teeth seemed brownish in color. I gave different KT numberes (1055 &amp; 1056) for pottery and bones. I gave them Locus 1002, since this structure was in that Locus. I thought about assigning a new Locus, but the rock-pile did not seemed that significant. I am not sure it was cultural or not. Also, I took down another pile of rocks at the SW corner (1 m from W &amp; S). This pile was not layed on levels. Just a conglomorate of 7 large rocks. Soil around the pile seemed compacted and color looked brownish. This pile did not had a flat rocks, and shape and the size of the rocks were irregular. This, I doubt to be cultural.    Locus 1004we took several cm down, but found almost nothing. We will take down more tomorrow and hope to find some cultural layer.     ,~: D-1-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1/Locus 1003,"100,2000-08-12," D-2-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2001,","   August 12, 2000      Today we are opening L 2009 in the west half of the trench and digging down level with the eastern half of the trench. So far nothing interesting has surfaced, although the area below L 2007 in the SW corner is continuing to be very hard, so we will dig that separately as L 2010. There was also a small (30 cm diameter) grouping of four stoness in the NW corner, but since they were small, floating, apparently random, and not near anything else, we removed them.      When L 2009 is done being leveled, we may decide to divide the trench into quadrants and blast the SW one down until we hit something. However, in the process of leveling L 2009, we came across an extensive pit, or else just a very soft layer of dirt, covering most of the westen half of the trench, and some areas in the eastern half. In order to deal with this, we will close L 2009 and open L 2011 as a level of very soft fill.      We spent the rest of the day digging L 2010, although it was not completely leveled by the time the workday was over. We will dig it flat tomorrow, and also open L 2011.     ,~: D-2-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2001,"101,2000-08-12," F-4-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4000,","   August 12, 2000      What happened today? That's question I keep asking myself. I was digging happily in my trench F1 when we found a cool pot in the section F4. It was located in level 8 at the North West side.   Bradley saw it and decided that we were out of the Hellenistic/Islamic phase and decided to begin a trench there. Sounds good, lets do it.   We told the guys doing the section to stop picking and clear away the loose dirt for a quick photo of the pot in situ.   When that was finished I changed bags from Level 8 to Locus 4000 picking up KT#'s where we left off in the section. I began to level the trench by trying to bring it down to the level that the pot seemed to be on.   I lost track of time and waited till the last minute to remove the pot. I removed the dirt still within the pot and called it KT#4028. Then I picked up the pot and a sherd of another pot as well as a few bone sherds and ut them all in the bag for KT#4027.                        ,~: F-4-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4000,"102,2000-08-12," C-2-2000-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2023,","   August 12, 2000   We continued to dig L2041 down to the level of the stones of L2048 in preparation for a plan photograph. We are also continuing to excavate L2045. We believe it to be a surface similar to L2039, though it does not have pottery on its surface. It does, however, have a grindstone frag at the day's opening level. We are also straightening our baulks for drawing. We are only exposing L2045 a few cm because of its likeness to L2039.   We plan-photoed the trench and will plot some reference points for Drew tomorrow. That is where we will pick up tomorrow. We opened L2049 which is a surface below L2039 and L2045.      August 13, 2000   Today our plan is to finish the trench for this year. This entails finding out the courses of our walls (L2045, L2038, L2037, L2047, L2042, L2046), We will also remove the surface L2049 and continue to excavate the pit L2028.

Still, it is the same surface. Someone excavated NE corner little deeper than the other area. Looking at that pit, it seems that there are still more surfaces to come below. We made the surface flat, and took a photo, and closed the Locus 3000. I wonder why there are this many surfaces on top of each other. Some pot-sherds looked somewhat different than before. Most of the pot-sherds were well fired and the cut had a uniform color in general. However, I found some sherds with black color in fresh break. Well, we must wait for the pottery rading to be sure.    Locus 3002This is the Locus below 3000, which is another surface. there is another surface below, with many sherds. There were some round rocks below the surface of 3000. There could be some space of time between these levels, but I am not sure at this moment. Since we (area D) lost two best workers, today was a slow day. Hope we can get better workers tomorrrow. A guy that worked in this trench was lazy and did not do much.

We laid out the grid for the trench and began digging to a depth of 10cm. The soil was loose in composition with a mixed context of pottery. We guessed that most of this pottery is Hellenistic. At 10:30 we found a loomweight. At 10:51 we found a chert core. By lunch time we had two-thirds of the trench dug to a depth of 10cm.      July 22, 2000      began by cleaning trench. we will continue to excavate L2000 (topsoil layer). We will open a new locus L2001 (though the soil color and texture appears to be the same), knowing that we have removed the topsoil.   At 8 am we opened L2001. It appears to be the same as L2000. Looking at the stratigraphy there is a definite topsoil layer only 4 cm deep. Everything below that at our current depth of 34 cm (at the east wall baulk) appears to be one stratigraphic layer. The top of L2001 appears to be a mudslide with pockets of loose soil impinging a majority of tightly packed a majority of tightly packed soil (ie the mudslide). The loose soil might be caused by rodent burrowing, but more likely is caused by tree roots. Just below the surface of the trench one can see 6 or 7 small tree stumps.   At 47 cm below the surface, we have uncovered a small rock alignment made up of 2 large stones. White pebbles of plaster (perhaps) are found in the immediate area (about 0.5 meter radius).   We began digging L2002 at 10:25. L2002 appears to be the same as 2001, except for a rock alignment which is made up of 2 river stones about 20 cm in diameter at our present height. These lie atop packed dirt. We have yet to see the extent of this wall by the time we closed for the day. We will start tomorrow by excavating around the wall to find it_Ñés extent.      July 23, 2000   We began by cleaning the trench. We plan to continue excavating L2001 which appears to be a packed mudslide layer. We will also continue excavation of L2002 which we believe contains a wall. One change we plan to make is to contract L2002 so that it contains just the area where we believe the wall is. After digging down about 4 cm in L2001 a scatter of animal bones was found in the southwest corner of the trench. We believe this to be a pit and have designated it L2003. The pit is characterized by loose and darker soil than the surrounding soil. The bones are associated with a small root system in the far southwest corner of the trench.   After excavating L2001 about 10 cm below L2002 (rock alignment and packed soil) we uncovered a fairly symmetrical \platform\ or mudbrick fall. After consultation with Bradley we divided the trench on its north/south axis. We closed L2001 and opened L2004 and L2005 which lie directly beneath L2001. L2004 is the western portion of the trench and L2005 is the eastern portion. We did this so as to not contaminate the \mudbrick fall\ with any other artifacts.   After a section was taken from L2002 (called L2006) Bradley sprayed the baulks, to see any existing mudbrick lines. Nothing definite was found. Our strategy for tomorrow will be to cut the top off of L2002 in order to determine the nature of this deposition. We will also lower L2005 by 10-15 cm to further expose L2002.      July 24, 2000   We began by excavating the animal bone deposit (L2003). Our plan is to slice the top off our \mudbrick fall\ (L2002) to determine its nature, lower L2005 by 10-15 cm to further expose the mudbrick fall, and then continue excavation.   when we arrived at the site we noticed that some long bones that were protruding from the L2003 yesterday were removed today by looters.   After consulting with Andy we concluded that we had two mudbricks and a possible eroded fallen mud wall. We proceeded to section the trench into quadrants. The mud platform would be leveled to the same depth as L2005 with the exception of the two mud bricks and a rock between them- L2002. We closed 2003 and opened the area beneath it as L2007. L2007 appears to be a layer of fill with some animal bones sticking out. We believe it is the same as L2004. We will dig L2007 sown another 10-15 cm. The eastern half of the trench will be divided into two halves- a north and a south. After taking down L2007 we will proceed to lower L2008- the southeast corner- by 10-15 cm. Hopefully this will illuminate our situation with our mud brick wall.   We divided the trench into quadrants and changed loci. At 12pm we are working with 4 loci(2007, 2008, 2009, 2010) and our mudbricks (2002). We split the trench into quads in order to have greater horizontal control, over this seemingly large fill area.   In L2007 we have uncovered the top of a possible potsmash. We will continue to lower these loci.   As we investigate the section on the east side, we can see some indication of a possible mudbrick construction (some thin red lines separated by a thin white line) but this is very uncertain.      July 25, 2000   Today we will need to get elevations for L2010. We will then proceed to excavate the quadrants beginning with L2009 then going on to L2010. The depths of the east and west halves of the trench will be staggered into a steplike configuration with loci 2007 and 2009 being deeper than loci 2008 and 2010. By doing this we hope to determine if the mudbricks we have unearthed are at the top of a wall and by going deeper we can uncover it.   After consulting with Bradley we decided to level L2010 to the same depth as L2008. Then we will take a section of L2002 to see if the fallen mudbrick wall is more apparent. After that we will consult with Bradley again. In L2002 there are a few clumps of pottery, a couple of which look articulated.   After consulting Andy we decided that we definitely had a three tier mud brick wall, but we weren't sure where it went. We decided to take L2009 down by 20cm because it seemed fairly empty . Though we are keeping our eyes open for pits. We will trowel down the edges of L2008 and L2010 as well as the bottom in the hopes of better defining our mudbrick will.   After going down on L2009 we came across a deposit of ash- an oven. To define the area of the oven we took out a smashed pot in L2007 and renamed it L2011. We will now go sown on L2007 to help define the oven. We continue to level and trowel L2008 and L2010 to define the limits of our mudbrick wall.      July 26, 2000   We will begin today by taking elevations of all the presently existing loci. We will then continue to level and trowel L2008 and L2010 in the hope of defining the course of our mudbrick wall. We will also clean up L2007 and L2009 in order to better define the area of our oven. Then we will probably go further down on L2007.   After consulting with Bradley we noticed that we had at least three mud brick walls in our trench. We are still trying to define where the wall in L2008 goes, but the walls in L2007 and L2010 are fairly clear. Our hearth turned out to be three hearths. We believe it is a migrating hearth where one was built and then it gets moved around for one reason or another. We are currently trying to determine the depths of these hearths. The hearths become opened up as a new locus- L2012. We came to the bottom of L2011 and closed that locus. A wall is now becoming apparent in L2009. This along with a stone wall in L2012. Also in L2012 we have uncovered a small ceramic piece which looks to me like an open chicken beak. This is probably the first true small find of the dig. We took measurements and diagrammed the walls and hearths in our day plan, page 6. Tomorrow we have the day off, but the day after that we will probably come down around the hearths and the walls. All in all it was a good day of excavation and it is too bad that Chuck wasn't present for it. Most important, our small find and plethora of mudbrick walls really shows up our archrival trench, those B2 bastards.      28 July 2000   Today we will excavate the hearth (l2012) and our strategy will be to further define our mudbrick walls. We are as yet uncertain as to the nature of the south side of the trench because no definite structural lines can be discerned, but this looks to be the same texture as our definite mud bricks in the north side. Therefore we think it is mudbrick, but we do not know if it is a collapsed wall or a more definite configuration.   After consulting with Bradley we decided to take a section from L2008 and opened it as L2013. The purpose of this was to determine if we had another mudbrick wall or just collapse. Sure enough we began to see a wall from this section. we finally closed L2002, its purpose having been served to locate mudbrick. We leveled our migrating hearth L2012 and observed that the pit had been covered with \slup\- eroded mudbrick wash. In fact the hearth has major sluppage action. Not surprising we were the only trench with sluppage action. All the loser trenches had no sluppage. Below the slup was more ash layer.   In order to better define our mudbrick walls we decided to come down 10cm on the fill between our walls which we opened as loci L2014 in the north and L2016 in the south. The fill will be opened as L2015. The fill between L2016 and the southside of the trench becomes L2017.   By closing time we decided to combine L2007 and L2009 into a new locus L2018. We also decided to combine L2008 and L2010 into one locus L2019. We did this because they appear to be the same and we wanted to simplify our loci.   In conclusion we once again proved that C2 is where it is at. Our screaming chicken and plethora of mudbrick walls shows that we are badasses. Our asses our so bad it puts every other trench to shame, especially those Nazi bastards in area B.      29 July 2000   Today we will continue to clear off the mud brick erosion (L2018) from the top of the migrating hearth (L2012). We will then remove the remainder of L2012. Meanwhile we will also excavate L2019 starting at the rock lense (L2020) in the southeast corner, exposing it to see if it is the base of our mudbrick debris in that location. Meki will excavate L2019 close to the mudbrick wall on the north side of the trench (L2014).   By 11:35 am we have dug L2019 about 15 cm deeper, L2015 10 cm deeper, L2012 (ash pit/migrating hearth) we have been articulating the edges further, which surprisingly have run underneath L2016 (mudbrick wall, SW corner). This could be due to an animal burrow found nearby (about 10 cm to the west of the ash layer). Brian has been working in the SE corner articulating a rock-bone-pottery (L2020) which indicates a new level of deposition. We have also exposed a pit which is mostly located in the section, but extends 32 cm from the south section. Below it's ash fill is a layer of small stones, perhaps lining the bottom or thrown into it.   The fill to the northwest side of L2014 (mudbrick wall) has been designated L2021. About 10 cm down we found a stone alignment with a large corrugated potsherd. To the east of this locus, Andy suggests that another wall exists (see drawing):   In L2019 after scraping it flat Andy found some distinctively red soil. We will give this a new locus (L2025) and work around it for the time being. Andy also thought he saw possible mudbrick lines bisecting L2018 and L2019. Tomorrow we shall investigate these possible mudbricks and plan our strategy accordingly.   In summation, we have once again proved that the C2 Screamin' Chickens have the best trench of the entire tepe. Our mighty walls, numerous pits, and complex loci just make everyone else look bad, especially the simplistic, don't know how to take out a disk or shut the door, uncircumcised Philistine sons of bitches.      30 July 2000   Our strategy for today will be (1) to determine the depth of L2014, (2) to excavate and articulate the new mudbrick walls that run from north to south (3), to continue to find the margins of the pit L2012 (4), to articulate the rock scatter on the east side of the trench L2020 (5), to finish removing the pit L2022 and close that locus (6), to pedestal the stones in L2021 to see if they are associated with those in L2018.   Because of the large stones and pottery located in L2021 and the fact that they were floating suggests that they rested atop a surface and were unrelated to the stones in L2018. We will now change the locus to L2024 to be a surface.   The depth of L2014 is still undetermined at this time. It is at least 2 maybe 3 courses high.       31 July 2000   We began the day by getting photos of L2020 and plan shots of some of our walls. We took out the pottery and stone debris from L2020 and closed that locus. Below it we opened L2026, a fill layer composed of a very hard mudbrick debris. We also leveled L2019. While cleaning up L2026 we came to a softer level which we decided to open as a pit L2027.   At about ten to eight am we closed up L2013. Later while digging in L2026 we came upon another pit which was quite deep. We believe it is another oven, perhaps destroyed or an ash pit associated with a food preparation area. L2022 looks like a kiln because of all the hard-packed stone.   To make our trench more simplified, we consolidated L2019 and L2026 in to a new locus L2029. We did not see a difference between these two loci, thus we combined them. We ended the day by digging 10 cm into L2029. We also articulated our north/south mudbrick wall (L2023) down about 10 cm. The southwest corner of our trench is becoming quite interesting. On the east section is an ash pit of a relatively large and deep size - filled with ashy soil and charred bone. to the immediate southwest of this pit is what we believe to be the kiln L2022. A great deal of diagnostic pottery was found in the structure. It's base is a very hard pack of fired clay and stone. That will have to stay in our section as pulling it out will leave a large hole there.   Our strategy tomorrow will be to excavate L2029 to the level of some green-yellow mudbrick material seen in a section under L2023. We will also finish L2022 and photograph it.      1 August 2000   We began the day by taking elevations to double check some questionable figures of yesterday. We then got photos of two pits L2022 and L2028. We then proceeded to take down L2029 by 5 cm. We are cautious when diggin near L2023 our north/south mudbrick wall because we are looking for the second course of brick which is designated by a yellowish green tint. Our man plan is to dig L2029 down to the level of L2018. We will then re-evaluate our loci and plan our strategy according to the layout of our trench at that more uniform elevation.   11:30. We decided to take L2025 down by 5 cm at first and then probably more depending on what we see. We also noticed a mudbrick between L2022 and L2028 so we opened up that L-shaped area as L2030. Hopefully we will be able to consolidate L2029, and L2018 because they appear to be the same color and texture - a light grayish brown mudbrick collapse. We also hope to close out L2022 and L2028. All of these could probably be combined into a singular locus. We also want to articulate our mud brick wall L2023. Perhaps we can even get a good plan photo before the day is over.    We did consolidate L2029 and L2018 as they appear to be the same material. We are continuing to articulate L2023 our north south mudbrick wall. Our plan photo will have to wait until tomorrow, however.   In conclusion, our ability to handle the extreme complexity of our trench proves we are far beyond the operating level of the other trenches. C2 is a textbook example of how to excavate a trench. We're putting on an archaeology clinic. I do have one major point of contention today and, surprisingly, it doesn't involve B2. Instead it is B1, at least, half of B1. That stupid piÕó_ took a nice cold bottle of Uludag out of our cooler at the end of the day. There was no consideration whatsoever, just petty theft. Now I don't want to disseminate any stereotypes, but right now I'm thinking that the Danes are an ethic-lacking people. They don't seem to belong to society, but are rather a parasite gorging itself on the rest of civilized humankind. But that's just my opinion, I could be wrong.       2 August 2000   We begin by troweling the soil of loci 2029, 2018 looking at this soil it appears to be composed of the same material with small exceptions of root pits and some looser soil on the southern extreme between L2017 and L2022. We will not dig that area until we lower the major portions of L2032. After that we will articulate the loose pocket of soil.   Our main strategy today is to articulate all mudbrick walls and mudbricks and then to prepare our trench for a trench plan photograph.   After investigating L2025 we have decided that it is not mudbrick, but possibly a debris fill. No outlines could be defined and the soil is mottled with light gray and yellowish green. The yellowish green soil could be (and is probably) a mudbrick layer. As we look in the section of L2023 (mudbrick wall running north south) on can see a course of yellowish green soil that is quite symmetrical. Andy decided that it was probably structural. the texture of this structural material is very chunky and brittle and quite loose. It is not nearly as compact as the top few courses of mudbrick found in L2014. After digging a few centimeters of L2025 a larger deposit of yellowish green soil was found, though there were no signs of mudbrick lines on or near its surface. Therefore we decided to cut further into it to catch it in the section of L2023. We will designate it a new locus. Other curious facts about the yellowish green soil are that it is heavily paced with white hair width roots. And regarding the yellowish green in L2023, it does not appear as symmetrical on the east side section as it is on the west side section.   This was our stopping point for today. We dig 10 cm lower in L2015 to expose more yellowish green material as well. After that point we prepared to take a trench plan photo which was nearly completed today.   We return to work on Saturday, August 5th. Our strategy will be to finish photography, take elevations and to remove the mudbricks and continue downward.   In summation, I have a number of gripes today. The first was actually from yesterday, but at the time I was too speechless to address it. It concerns the desecration of my beloved Old Blackie. That goyim apikorsim Drew boy took Old Blackie while I was taking elevations and used a Sharpie to draw a face on her. This is a blatant violation of everything the Fraternal Order of Archaeologists holds sacred. You never mess with another man's trowel. That is just a given. It is an unwritten more of society. The only way to rectify the situation is to wash the trowel clean in the blood of the offender. Only then will the Trowel Goddess of the Hatti lands will be appeased.    Another point I would like to make concerns the management. While writing in this journal we were approached and asked if we could help with the shopping. Now I have no problem with helping out. The problem is that they want to do it now while everyone is smack dab in the middle of entering their notebooks into the database. If we had been told ahead of time or asked to go in fifteen minutes I have no doubt that their would be many volunteers. Instead management will go and sulk. So to hell with it.    Finally, I will just say that the Screamin' Chickens of C2 are leaving all the other trenches in our wake. We are sexy bitches. Yeah baby, yeah.      5 August 2000   Because of the wind storm on Wednesday, August 2nd, cleaning the trench is extensive. We need to re-photo the trench for our trench plan, take elevations for our day plan and tag the loci in the east section of the trench. Hopefully we will accomplish this in a few hours and be able to remove the mudbricks in L2014 and L2016. We would like to continue to excavate down to the yellowish-green structural layer. If it is a mudbrick type we should see some symmetry. Perhaps it will follow the orientation of the existing mudbrick walls. It looks as though it follows L2023 and is found closely associated with L2014.   Michealle is a guest today. We spent a lot of time plumb bobbing strategies sections of the trench for the plan so that Drew has reference points. After about an hour of that we tagged the stratigraphic layers in the east baulk with very large nails. The trench now looks like a garage sale when there is nothing left to sell out the tables. Bradley/Andy asked us to photograph the phases of the mudbrick walls, another hour or so of inactivity.   finally after all that we were able to chop 3 courses off the wall in L2014 on the east side. It was a cathartic experience. There is now a pile of 3000 year old mudbrick rubble on the floor.   Tomorrow we will finish closing L2014 and L2016 as well as begin the search for more mudbrick in the south of L2032 and the floor of L2015.      6 August 2000   Continuing where we left off yesterday, we cleaned the mudbrick debris from L2014 and found a pit L2034. Michaelle articulated the fill layer of the pit (a dark silt charcoal) and has arrived at a rock-pottery-bone layer. It looks strikingly similar to L2022. We will photo it and continue to dig it.   We are also digging the rest of L2033. It looks as though it spills out into L2032 shallowly.   L2012 continues under our mudbrick wall L2016 so we are sectioning L2016 to see what came first, the pit or the wall. It looks like the pit cuts into a second course of wall so we are moving cautiously to see what comes first. After some digging, it looks as though the pit L2012 continues under the mudbrick wall L2016. L2016 also contains a semi-course of mudbrick under the more definite bricks. This could be a mudbrick \mortar\ laid over the pit to hold the bricks in place.   We also excavated L2024 down to the present level of the western half of the trench. Nothing new was found in that loci except a few more large stones. They may be associated with the stones found along the west side of L2023.   After excavation of L2034 and finding a stone that looks to be a partial door post resting atop the layer of plaster and packed stones and pottery that this could have been a door post. We will trowel around that area to see what kinds of things are associated with this locus. We will not finish excavating this locus until we bring down the surrounding locus L2032 because of the hardness of the pit surface and its depth.   We also found a pit located in the east baulk on the north side and partially under L2035 (the fill under L2014 - the mudbrick wall). This pit is called L2036. It contained very little artifacts but was filled with an extremely fine white ash. We did not completely excavate this pit as time ran out.   Tomorrow we will finish with the pits L2034 and L2036. We will also dig the large fills L2032 and a currently unnamed locus on the west side of the trench to see if our north south mudbrick wall L2023 continues to have courses beneath it.      7 August 2000   We began by finishing the pit L2036. We got through the very white ash layer and beneath that (immediately beneath) was found some broken long bones (in very small pieces) and a tooth ( a very thick incisor), and a bead. We logged the bead as a small find. The tooth looks more animal than human, so I am assuming this is still an animal deposit.   We also lowered L2032 significantly. This is the fill on the east side of the trench surrounding the pits on the east baulk and the wall L2023 which bisects the trench.   directly beneath L2015 we were able to articulate another mudbrick wall or surface that runs almost parallel to L2023 called L2037. there is another mudbrick on the northeast corner of the trench called L2038. The space in between L2037 and L2038 looks also to be mudbrick. A mudbrick network is arising.   We dug L2032 down about 20 cm and it is spotted with 2 small pits on its west side. these pits look insignificant, but will be removed with caution. We are now digging a new locus L2039 which is the fill to the south of a small reddish colored mudbrick wall L2040. L2039 is located to the north of the pits on the south baulk (L2022 and L2033). We will excavate it about 20 cm lower that its present level. My overarching plan is to remove enough soil on the east side of the trench so that the east and the west sides are approximately the same elevation. once that has been accomplished with will examine both sides together.   We lowered L2028 another 15 cm and found a small metal band. Quite interesting though it was found in an ash pit.   We lowered L2039 about 20 cm and found nothing significant except an additional mudbrick in the wall L2040.   We finished the day excavating 5 cm from a new locus L2041. This is the fill below the ash layer L2012. 60 Minutes filmed us working on this locus.      8 August 2000   We began by finishing leveling out the west half of the trench L2041. It looks as though there is some mudbrick on the north side of L2041 called L2044. After scraping and sweeping we definitely have mudbrick walls, probably a continuation of L2037 and L2038. Once we remove the north/south wall L2023 we should see L2044 and L2037 and L2038 connect.   While deciding how to approach L2023, our north/south mudbrick wall, we dig 10 cm lower in L2039. At the bottom of this locus we found a rock alignment following the southeast trend of L2040.   One of the biggest questions I had today was the nature of L2023, and if it had any relation to the mudbricks found in L2037 and L2038. I also wanted to know how many courses L2023 has. in order to answer this last question, I sectioned the wall into a new locus L2043 on the west side where the bricks were best exposed and found that L2023 has definitely 4 courses and perhaps 5. I suspect however that this fifth course is actually L2037 running underneath L2023. This because the color of this \course\ is the same as L2037.   Before this section L2043 was taken, however, I had a plan photo taken of L2023 knowing that it would be removed today.   I finally named the rock alignment found near the center of the trench (L2042) and took opening elevations.   At the bottom of the section L2043, we found another rock alignment running parallel to L2042 with 2 courses of mudbrick between them. This looks to be a continuation of L2037. When we remove L2023, we should see its relationship to the rest of the mudbricks in the trench.   After investigating the mortar lines of L2023 and L2037 I saw that they didn't match up and that L2023 runs more north/south proper and L2037 runs more in a north, northwest direction. Therefore L2023 looks to be a later phase of construction.   Finally, we began to remove L2023 and will finish that job tomorrow.      9 August 2000   We began by removing L2023 in order to expose L2037 and L2038 and L2044. Hopefully L2038 and L2044 are the same.   After scraping L2032 we find what appears to be the bottom of some mudbrick debris. under this mudbrick debris we see a dark silty layer. We may change loci depending on how extensive the dark layer is. It may only be redent root pits. After investigation, we decided to keep L2032 intact as it is. The pits referred to earlier are too minor to change locus.   Additionally we see some possible mudbrick bordering the pits L2028 and L2036. These may be structures bordering or walling-in these pits.   We have started a new locus L2045. It is in the southwest corner of the trench. Lots of pits mixed with some packed mudbrick debris.   While digging out L2023 we found that L2044 was not mudbrick as it was only 2-3 cm thick. Under that is another course of stone.   Regarding L2032 and the surrounding pits, we thought earlier today that the pits were bordered by walls. After spraying the area, some colors of red mudbrick showed, but no articulation could be made. Therefore no walls.   After digging L2045 for about 15 cm, nothing new surfaced except for large stones (1 conglomerate riverstone, and one smooth stone) and some pottery.   We are now moving to L2039 and bringing that down 15 cm. It looks as though we've come upon a surface. It is covered with pottery and small rocks. A course of stone is also bisecting the locus - running southeast.   We sectioned L2034 to find its depth and to see the rocks and pottery in their configuration we also found in excellent charcoal sample below the pit. We no longer think its a door post so much as we believe it to be an oven.   We are also removing L2030, L2031, L2040. There is not enough evidence to prove if they are mudbricks. The top resembles mudbrick, but the sections show no definite stratigraphy. Below them we see a course of stones in section. We will close L2040, 2030, 2031 and L2034 hopefully today.   Investigating L2030 and it looks as though the brick is resting on part of L2028.   We closed L2034, 2030, 2031, 2040 and 2044 today.      10 August 2000   We began by cleaning and articulating L2045 and L2039, getting them ready for a photo, at same time we opened a new locus L2046, which is a cobblestone wall, beneath the fill, which consisted of the L2030, L2031 and L2040.    We then opened L2047, which is line of mudbrick running parallel to L2037, although on a lower level. It abuts L2037, L2041 and L2046.    After this we opened a third locus L2048, which is a stone wall below L2044, we can see 2 rows of large cobbles in 1 course along the north baulk, abutting L2041.   When we had done this, we agreed to remove L2022, very carefully, fearing that it could bring a large part of the south baulk down.    While searching for the precise border of L2038, CE found an area with burnt wood, you could almost see the grains in the wood/charcoal, this wood was below L2034.   Jakob suggests that the kiln / oven L2034 and L2036 the ash pit beside it are the same phase.    We think that the burnt wood in between them could have been used to feed the fires in the oven / kiln. We saved a great deal of the charcoal for a carbon sampling and we took a soil sample from the same area.   We are working on articulating mudbrick walls to the east of L2037. These are probably related or the same as L2047.   We closed L2039, because we have come down to a surface with a potsmash, cobbles and other pottery are lying flat. This surface is located south of L2046 a stone alignment.   By noon we uncovered another row of cobbles parallel to L2048 and we decided to extend L2048 to cover these stones, as they seem to be part of the same structure.       August 12, 2000   We continued to dig L2041 down to the level of the stones of L2048 in preparation for a plan photograph. We are also continuing to excavate L2045. We believe it to be a surface similar to L2039, though it does not have pottery on its surface. It does, however, have a grindstone frag at the day's opening level. We are also straightening our baulks for drawing. We are only exposing L2045 a few cm because of its likeness to L2039.   We plan-photoed the trench and will plot some reference points for Drew tomorrow. That is where we will pick up tomorrow. We opened L2049 which is a surface below L2039 and L2045.      August 13, 2000   Today our plan is to finish the trench for this year. This entails finding out the courses of our walls (L2045, L2038, L2037, L2047, L2042, L2046), We will also remove the surface L2049 and continue to excavate the pit L2028. We also must begin drawing the East baulk today.     ,~dc-terms:title: C-2-2000-08-013-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,"107,2000-08-13," C-1-2000-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1033,","   August 13, 2000      We took our second plan photo this morning. Now we are taking the rocks in the West off their pedastals. Also we are leveling L1037, taking the potential surface away.   The rocks in the West are the top most level of L1045. There was not much there. The entire section outside of the potential mud-brick is L1045. There is not really a definite line to make it different from L1044, but because of the location of the rocks above and Elvan's wall (L1043) on the East, the Southeast corner of L1045 is put near L1043 and L1035. There are some rocks and pieces of pottery near the West baulk on the North side of L1046, the potential mud-brick. It may be the edge of L1046 or a pit, too early to tell.   So L1046 is the mudbricky construction on the West baulk. We will clear away from it. We have already started in the South pulling away from the West baulk.   We are clearing L1037 from the South where L1034 was cut yesterday, all the way North to the NB. L1031 is closed and the fill behind L1039 will become part of L1037. We seem to be cutting through this potential surface across the board.   After breakfast we chopped L1045, the South part down 20cm in a square to straighten and look for lines. There seem to be bricks there and possibly even under where we chopped, they extend out. It is very choppy and hard to tell what is what. I found some slag in the corner that is similar to some we found a potential watermelon seed in above this.   Then we chopped down the remains of L1042 from the baulk in the Southeast corner. In the bualk there seems to have been a redline above a lot of the rocks and pottery in this section. It may have dropped off as I saw nothing like this when we cut out L1042 yesterday.   Under L1037 there seems to be a potential hole with ash-maybe an oven. The rocks on the East baulk, of L1033 and L1036, are beginning to pedastal without obvious things underneath.        ,~: C-1-2000-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1033,"108,2000-08-13," B-1-2000-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1008,","   8/13/2000   We started the day by removing the sourthern section of L1008, this was done by dividing the soil into layers and loci that resembled the loci on the eastern side og the wall, so L1030  (some of) L1007, L1021L1031 and L1028L1032, L1025 was closed and the soil beneath it was part of L1032. The following Loci was opened and closed in the process L1030, L1031 and L1032, and I closed L1025.   I then extended L1028 to cover the area of the southern section.   Have begun to dig L1028 another, seem to have hit an area of some ashy stuff, will dig more carefull and scrape afterwards.   Jeg foeler mig noget traet efter gaarsdagens solskin.   Removed the cobbles from the northern section of L1008, and there by closing it, used the same procedure as used in southern section, opening and closing loci L1033, L1034 and L1035, decided to extend L1027 under L1035.   After this we were sweating a lot, because it was VERY HOT and a bit humid.    Then closed L1009 and opening L1036 under it, removed the dirt and extended L1028 under L1036, there by closing L1036.    After this we cleaned/sweeped the trench, in doing so we discovered a posible pit and a potsmash in L1027, along the north baulk.     ,~: B-1-2000-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1008,"109,2000-08-13," D-2-2000-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2010,","   August 13, 2000      Today we started by opening L 2011 in the western half of the trench and digging it down roughly 30 cm. An area of stones was found along the N balk. It doesn't look like much, but for now we are leaving it alone.       Possible oven residue was found in three small circles near the center of L 2011. Soil samples were taken from each, but they were not given separate locus numbers.      Andy came by and noticed that L 2010 was still looking pretty rough from yesterday, so he had us clean it up. When he came back it was looking like there were some mudbrick lines in the W balk. so we brought L 2010 down a little further to level it and straightened the balks as best we could. After cleaning and spraying L 2010 and the SW corner of the trench, it seems that there is a mud brick wall in this area. We have probably cut through about 1.5 courses. Lines are visible in the balks, and also in the southern half of L 2010.       Tomorrow we will scrape L 2010 down further in order to make the lines clearer.

And we started to remove the rocks in L1009 from the East side. Yesterday when we were leaving, we found a pot in the Southwest corner. It is probably related to the burial. And we found a spindle whorl, kt1056. This might be a burial good. It is located at the East of the burial near to the feet.   We are collecting the small bones together in kt1057 and we are saving all the soil in buckets. We will screen them and then I will take a soil sample from the screened soil.   We are still articulating the bones L1011. We couldn't find the feet and the legs are broken. There might be more than one person.   We are trying to remove all of L1009 and the soil South of the burial might be another locus but I didn't decide yet.   Under L1009 there are some reddish parts, but to identify them, we have to sweep the trench and we don't have enough time today.

We are screening all of the buckets that come from L2003.   After breakfast we continued to level L2005 to the same depth as L2004. After that we will take out the oven, keeping only a few pieces of it along with a soil sample from the area inside the oven. This fill is L2006.   By the end of the day L2005 was levelled to the same depth as L2004 and the oven has been taken out. Tomorrow I will scrape around to see if I've taken out the entire bottom of the oven and the fill inside it.

We are now 3m deep at the south baulk! This area of L2034 is more of the same hard-as-heck mudbrick pack with no tell-tale brick lines...are we plowing through something without seeing it??       We dug L2039 west section only as deep as the equivalent top elevation of L2016 plaster floor in the east. We stopped digging at that elevation because there are plaster marks an dash making a line equivalent to the elevation of L2016 as we looked at the section on the north face of L2039. The plaster of L2016 that we had determined continues southwards from the former south-edge of L2016 also continues westward, stopping at a mudbrick or at least hard-packed dirt clod in the far west part of L2039.      We wanted to trace the plaster floor L2016 back to the south so we cut a 30cm wide section against the east baulk all the way through L2037-mudbrick wall. We sprayed the oil and believe that the plaster surface L2016 DOES NOT continue underneath L2037-mudbrick wall. The base of the 30cm wide section we cut into L2037 appears to be the same material as L2037, i.e., same yellowish soil with lots of colorful smal-sized river pebbles. The plaster apears to stop at the northern edge/northern seam of L2037. NOTE we recovered no pottery/lithics/bone from L2037 because there was none to collect!      In order to better understand L2038, we continued digging our 30cm cut southwards adjacent to the east baulk, now cutting into L2038 all the way southwards until we hit the northern edge of L2036. This small section of L2038 contained a noticeable amount of raw clay greenish-grey in color and non-greasy in consistency. There was no pottery nor bone to collect, although we came up with one lithic piece.       We also began digging L2010 today--startng with the  est\ all along the southernmost edge. We took this narrow strip of higher-elev. bricks (which had been chopped into when we originally excavated to find L2010 wall) down 40cm such that the top of L2010 bacame one continuous level with no artificial shelf as it had been before. Then we decided to treat the remainder of the wall in two halves: east and west. We removed the \facing bricks\ on both the north and the south sides of the \body bricks\, taking them down to the level where we can no longer determine new courses of brick on the south side--i.e., 40cm approx.      A \seam\ 6cm wide that we see in the top of L2036 corresponded with a distinctive crack running vertically through the facing bricks on the north side of L2010. Once these facing bricks (or at least the upper 40cm of them on this north side--the facing bricks continue further down in depth on the north side than the facing bricks on the south side) had been removed, we saw clearly that this distinctive crack in the north-side facing bricks on L2010 CONTINUES and also appears very distinctively in the \body bricks\ of L2010 on the north side. We believe that this major seam in L2036 corresponds to a two-phase construction sequence and the crack in L2010 corresponding to this \seam\ in L2036 may be a result of shifting, or of major damage, or perhaps indicates that both L2010 and L2036 were constructed in two parts this way. HOWEVER the body and facing bricks on the south side must be examined before we can concretely say that a seam in L2010 is likely.      N.B. SEE HARD COPY OF  FOR DIAGRAMS OF LOCI BEFORE AND AFTER TODAY'S EXCAVATIONS.      We believe that the floor system L2016-L2014-L2015-L2017 is roughly contemporary with L2037 wall while L2038 represents mudbrick fill packed between L2037 and L2036. L2037 seems to be a house wall because it is softer and coarser in composition compared to the \defensive\ walls to its south and L2037 has facing bricks only on the south side (i.e., the north side faces the interior of some entity.)       L2036 definitely goes with L2010 because of the way the walls were constructed flush against each other and they show continuous damage in the seam/crack correspondence. L2036 and L2010 are very likely some kind of defensive wall or city wall of some sort. We think it is plausible that a house of some domestic/occupational space (or even fortification tower-dormitory??) is situated OUTSIDE the city walls--i.e., L2037 and the surface sequence L2014-17.      Perhaps digging down L2038 will help determine whether walls L2037 and L2036 are contemporary or whether wall L2036 runs much deeper and is therefore earlier (?) than L2037.        ,~: A-2-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2010,"114,2000-08-14," D-2-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2010,","   August 14, 2000      Andy and Bradley came by early this morning after we scraped L 2010 flat. We decided that the area was not well defined enough to be mud brick yet, so we are holding off on opening L 2012. Instead, we are going to take L 2010 down another 5 cm to see if we are able to start seeing mudbrick lines.      After removing 5 cm and scraping the area super flat, it looks less likely that there is a wall in this area. Bradley came by and noticed that the lines in the balk are starting to look more like sedimentary layers than brick: there are long continuous horizontal lines, but no vertical ones except for animal holes. In addition, the lines that were once faintly visible on the surface of L 2010 have now pretty much disappeared.       Now the plan is to flatten L 2011 and then to bring L 2010 down level with it. We will then decide what to do with the locus situation on the western half of the trench. In flattening L 2011, we continued to have the same areas of very soft soil that we had yesterday. Towards the middle of the locus there were again small areas of different colored soil. After we finished level the main part of L 2011, we started work on the pile of rocks along the N balk. There were quite a few stones in this area, but they appeared to be just tumble, so we kept them as L 2011. We did however, give the area its own KT numbers.      When L 2011 was completely leveled, we started working on bringing L 2010 down. However, my workmen were starting to drag at this point, and in the time left we were only able to get half of L 2010 chopped. At some point while we were digging this section, Andy came by and said that he thought there still might be a wall in this area, but it might be lower down.      Tomorrow is my last day, so we will try and get a little deeper, but it is not looking likely that we will find anything.

This gets it's own pottery bag. We at the same time are moving North in our L1045 probe to find the edge of the L1046 mud-bricks. This brings us up to Elvan's street (L1043).   Next I will level L1044 in what appears to be a futile effort to find bricks there, or anything of note. The greatest hope for this area remains the Southeast corner where it seems 2 bricks have appeared just cutting the corner. I am unable to find any symmetry in our probe into L1045, though most of the dirt is pretty solid. It might all be collapse. We have swept L1044. In the Northeast near the baulk between L1036, L1033 there is definitly an ash pit, a donut and some smashed pottery and pebbles, perhaps it is a kitchen.   To see about finding something in L1045, we dropped another 15cm. We swept L1044 and are trying to see something there. There may be a line running from the edge of L1042 to the edge of L1043. This would be constitant with our big pit theory. The pit theory is that people later dug a hole on our south baulk down quite far and took all the big rocks. Perhaps it was my original well theory. We will look for lines in the baulk. It seems we have never found anything where L1009 and now L1044 are. There are big chuns coming up in L1044, so maybe we are cutting through brick.   Around breakfast we dropped L1044 and squared off cell corners. The same was of L1045, which we had dropped an additional 15cm. Also we are cappadocing L1036 to see if there is anything underneath. If not, the stones can be removed.   Well we found a great little glass or rock crystal blade North of L1036 on the East baulk. We also cleared under L1033 to a small extent. In the North, just west of L1039 we dropped 10cm to see if there was anything in L1045. Finally we removed the collapse on the West side of L1043.     ,~: C-1-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1033,"116,2000-08-14," F-4-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4000,","   August 14, 2000   We're still straigtening the east baulk. We cleaned the trench and took elevations.    I began the morning by trowling around the NW corner of the trench where we found the large pot in situ 2 days ago (KT 4027). I found lots of ash and burnt clay and some hard brick like material. I decided to change locus to L4001 and chopped out a large chunk of hard clay at the NW baulk to level the locus. After we chopped we found loads of splintered bone and small pottery pieces. We decided to clean the locus, sift all dirt and get it ready for photographs just in case it was a surface.    Meanwhile in the rest of L4000 I went down about 10cm in the NE corner ina 1.5m wide probe which yielded the same material as the previous layer. I decided to clean the entire trench and talke a photo to get my bearings.   After the photo we changed locus again, L4003 is a buffer zone extending from the east to west baulk about .5m wide. We opened this locus because Bradley was concerned that there was some contamination because the workers dump all the dirt right over the side of the trench. We changed everything that wasn't L4001 or L4003 to L4002 which covered the middle of the trench.    In L4002 I dug 10cm and then another 5cm in a section extending North to south along the east baulk.   Tomorrow we will level the trench.        ,~: F-4-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4000,"117,2000-08-14," B-1-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1008,","   8/14/2000   Started the day by digging the pit (discovered yesterday), as L1037 and took a soil sample, in doing so I discovered that it was a thin layer of dust................I then stopped the paperwork on L1037, and cancelled that locus, so I could use the number later.   After this we dug 10 cm in L1028, while Djengis articulated the potsmash in L1027, finding that the most of the pot was in the baulk, and will be completly removed at a later date.   While scraping around the potsmash, we uncovered a \big-ass\ sherd, KT 1188.   I am beginning to believe that the 2 loci I have are very similar and maybe equal, therefore we began to level the whole trench.    As we were ploughing through the soil of L1027 we turned up, 2 very preserved pots. One a small nipplebased cup, the other a some what coarse piece of kitchen ware (?).   As we were cleaning for photo of the two pots, we uncovered a rectangular pit in the NW corner of L1027, naming it L1037 (due to lack of locus sheets.......must remember!) After cleaning, Bradley came by and outlined several pits in the trench, and advising me to close L1027 and L1028, which I then did. I will assign new loci tomorrow.         ,~: B-1-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1/Locus 1008,"118,2000-08-14," F-2-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2002,","   14 August 2000   The plan for today is to make sure the entire oven and the fill inside it are out and close both loci.   After poking around I noticed that the soil in the southern half of the trench was harder packed so I closed L2004 and opened up L2007 beneath it. I checked the oven, scraped around, and decided that I had found the bottom of it so I closed L2002 and L2006.   Now I'm having my workers take L2007 down by 15cm. I poked around the north half and noticed a new surface emerging in the northwest corner. I will therefore close L2005 and open up 2 loci beneath it- L2008, the new surface and L2009, the rest of the northern half.   After we pushed l2007down 15cm I didn't notice anything so i had them go down another 5cm. Meanwhile I scraped around L2008 and found that it extended farther than i originally thought.        ,~: F-2-2000-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2002,"119,2000-08-15," B-2-2000-08-015-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2,","B-2-2000   July 21, 2000      Laid out trench, swept perimeter. the elevation was taken as the average between the highest and lowest points. we started digging locus 2000 in the southern half of the trench. we dug roughly 10cm through the topsoil, which was dry and clumpy. we found many, many pot sherds in this section and one bone fragment. a possible lithic was put in the pottery bag to be washed.      roughly 10 cm down, we hit a harder packed surface, sloping downhill to the west and lighter in color than the topsoil. this extended across the entire southern half of the trench. we didn't open this as a new locus because we had to finish digging the northern half of locus 2000.      the northern half was similar to the southern half except that it was rockier and only about 5cm thick from the surface to the layer of harder packed soil below, which was contiguous with the layer on the southern side. we found many more sherds here, and also a larger bone fragment. we did not entirely finish excavating this section of locus 2000, and so will continue tomorrow before opening locus 2001.      surface find consisting of a large fragment of a stone pot was located 86 cm east and 193 cm north of the southeast corner of the trench. both measurements were taken from the 5 meter trench line, not the 4 meterbalk wall. as the fragment was found outside the trench, it was not given a kt number. the work day ended before an elevation could be taken. it will be taken tomorrow.         July 22, 2000      Stone pottery surface find is at elevation zero (2.57) according to the line leveling method which was changed to stadia rod measurements today. Elevations taken on 7/21 were adjusted and recorded in the notebook according to the stadia rod measurements.      Potsherds were ecenly distributed throughout the loci and most pieces were 1.5 cm thick. We dug 10 cm on the southern side in soil which was densley packed mud wash. This continued so we began digging the eastern side of the trench in an attempt to level it. We swept things clean and no new locus appeared so we dug another 15 cm.      After digging these 15 cm we encountered a large body sherd .5 m SW from the NE corner. We searched for more fragments, but didn_Ñét find anything else. Later as we were cleaning and straightening the balk wall in this area we found a pot smash which this earlier sherd seemede to fit. We estimate the pot was 10 cm below the previous sherd. We are working on cleaning the area and leveling it for photographing tomorrow. The pot is 19 cm off the E wall and 47 cm off the N wall. A rough size estimate of the debris field which is colsely articulated is 32 cm wide and 34 cm long. When it is more fully unearthed tomorrow we will get more specific meaurements.      Also midway along the E wall were large stones which appeared to be cut and were at the same level as the pot. We will look for a possible suface tomorrow in this area and 2-4 cm below the pot and rocks.         July 23, 2000      We began by straghtening the balks and leveling the floor surrounding the pot smash. Drew came and took 2 photos. One close up plan shot for drawing and one at an angle. He later returned and took one in context which also shows L-2002 which we opened today.      Additionally we found a piece of basalt midway along the east wall abutting the balk. It was a piece of grindstone and was given KT 2011 and bagged as a small find.      We then began digging down a raised section midway along the east wall of the trench. It was ground outside of the 1m section around the potsmash and consequently was not leveled before the picture. After it was at the level of the potsmash and surrounding earth we dug the eastern 2m of the trench down 10cm attempting to find any surface the pot may have been resting on. As we did so we noticed the earth became slightly more moist and it was more brown in color. We then opened L-2002 for the estern half of the trench. Locus-2001 remained opened in the NE corner in a 1m square surrounding the pot smash and in the western half of the trench. We were then advised that the area around the pot should be given its own locus to avoid contamination of its context. We opened L-2003 in a 1m square surrouding the pot which had formerly been a section of L-2001.      Our workman Matine found a large potbase when he was picking the eastern side of the trench. We estimate it was located 12cm off the E wall and 80 cm off the S wall. It was 16 cm north to south and 12 cm east to west. We took the elevation and bagged it as a small find.      We then uncovered 2 large rocks which as yet don't seem to be anything but rocks. One was along the north balk and 99cm off the E balk. The other was in the center of L-2002. 176m off the N wall and 116cm off the E wall.      After cleaning off the southern third of L-2002 we came upon a ring of reddish soil surrounding a white center. We call it the Red Donut. The ring was about 90cm from both the south and east walls. We gave this area a new locus, L-2004. The ring is 18cm in diameter, but we are currently unsure of whether it is a surface and a larger area should be designated L-2004. We will clean further tomorrow troweling the surrounding area more level to determine the appropriate designation.      Earlier in the day we also found examples of basalt grindstones. The first was found in L-2001 and was lodged next to the E balk 218cm off the S balk. The next is slightly questionable as to its function as a grindstone, but it was found in L-2002 105cm off the E balk and 30cm from the S.       July 24, 2000      We started by troweling the area around the red donut to bring it down the same level. as we did so, 2 more rocks appeared next to the rock 1.76 off N balk and 1.16 off E balk. This rock was found yesterday as it was taller than the others and stuck up into the 10 cm taken off yesterday. A large rock was also discovered in locus 2003 which was of similar size and could be in line with the other two. Another rock was discovered in locus 2002, somewhat smaller but also in a line with the larger grouping. it was located about 1 m south of the trio of rocks. we will continue to trowel this area in search of more rocks.      in addition to the rocks, we found other areas of reddish discoloration. we are tracing around them to see if they could be a surface. the new red spot in locus 2002 is between 1.40 and 1.52 m off the S balk, and between 1.36 m and 1.48 m off the E balk      After we had smoothed out and swept loci 2002 and 2003, Andy came and sprayed the eastern half of our trench. the E balk had a orange mark in the southern half which slanted down from right to left. Andy thought this may have been a mud brick line, though we did not remember encountering anything more than scattered bits of brick while we were digging. We decided to dig the western half of the trench to bring it to the same level as the eastern half and see if there were more reddish marks, mud bricks, or any indications of a surface. we designated this level of the western half of the trench locus 2005 and dug it a third at a time, going from south to north. the eastern side was dug roughly 20 cm, and the western roughly 5.       there were many pot sherds in L 2005, especially compared to 2002 which otherwise seemed equivalent. two reddish spots were also found, one in the southern third of the locus, and one in the middle third. A large number of whitish flakes were found in the southern third of the locus, which we took to be rmenants of a plaster surface. Rocks and corrogated sherds were also common in this part of the locus. in the middle third, we encounter a number of sherds which twisted, as if they were part of a spout.      After completing the excavation of 2005 to the same level as L 2002, we swept out the trench so that Andy could take a picture of the entire trench. Tomorrow we will dig 10 cm in L 2003 to see if we can locate the bottom of the potsmash. Andy believes that the surface may be below where we have dug to already, although we did find flat lying sherds and several stones in 2003 today.      July 25, 2000      We began today by sweeping down the entire trench so that Drew could come by and take another photo because the ones yesterday were washed out. The picture was of L-2005 which we opened yesterday. After that we took elevations and measurements of several rocks and a series of aligned corragated pot sherds. We felt that they could be on a surface.      After this Bradley and Andy reccommended that we start a new locus in the northwest corner around the L-2003 (the pot smash locus). So we opened L-2006 in this area. A mud floor was found 1-2cm under this locus. We called the floor L-2007. However the pre-floor layer was deemed important as it was directly on top of the surface so we saved the soil for a floataion sample in the hopes that we could find some seeds or other light items that had rested on the floor.      While we excavated L-2006/7 Matine and Zafir dug another 5cm in the southern third of L-2005. Another rock was discovered in this area as well as a flat lying group of pottery sherds, possibly a small pot smash. We took elevations and measurements for these items and gave the sherds KT# 2026.      We continued to epose the floor in L-2006, but it seems to end toward the north end of the locus. The floor and pre-floor layer have yielded not great finds except one possible piece of grindstone.      We were excavating L-2003 in the hopes that the pot was resting on the same mud surface. We could not find the mud floor, but multiple rocks were found to the west and south of the pot. Two seemed to be lodged under it. However we could not find this rock layer to the north of the pot.      We decided to open a new locus in 2002 because it could possibly be a pre-floor layer as well. We excavated the south third of locus 2002 down 5cm and it became L-2008. We will excavate the entire L-2002 leaving L-2004 (the donut) intact so we can get a plan section and see if it's anything cool.      We used the Munsell color chart today and decided that the red donut and its sister red marks were \""reddish yellow 6/6\"". T he pre-floor layer, L-2002, was \""light olive gary 6/2\"". The floor was \""light gray 7/2\"".      July 26, 2000      We began by sweeping the trench really, really well for a publishable photo of our floor. This took about 2 hours and was quite tedious.       After the photos we noticed that the south eastern corner of the trench seemed to be a different color and texture from the surrounding soil. The section seems to indicate a change as well. I have designated it a pit and given it L-2009. The color was matched to Munsell's \""gray 6/1\"". Other than ascertaining these few facts this new locus was left alone for the rest of the day.      Phil was feeling very sick and went home after breakfast. I toil alone.      I dug 15cm in southern half of L-2005. The area seems to be simply wash from hillside erosion so I felt that 15cm was justified without fear of tearing up the floor from L-2007 that doesn't seem to exist on that side of the trench.      I also took a section around L-2004 down about 10 cm. I am trying to determine if the red stain extends below the surface layer. After the section is cut precisely around the circle we will cut the circle in half and see what lies within.      I also took elevations for the rocks that surround the pot smash.      I finally took out the pot smash today. The area surrounding it was to the a point 4-5cm under where the pot rested so it was not needed for context anymore. Additionally we were worried that someone might mess with it since its been in there for a few days and lots of people know about it. Since we have a free day tomorrow and will be out of town, out came the pot. The dirt inside was gven L-2010 and it was all saved (KT#'s 2041 &amp; 2042) for a floatiation sample. Some pot sherds that were found yesterday in the rocks surrounding the pot were at roughly the same elevation as the bottom of the pot. (Pot 96.36 Unarticulated sherds 96.38) These sherds were given KT#2039 and were marked as a possible mend with the potsmash.      July 28, 2000      We swept the trench as usual so we could visually evaluate what we had. We think there could be mud brick lines in L 2008 near L 2009 in the southeast corner.      We took opening elevations for L 2009, a potential pit. Some areas were not measured on July 26, so we took elevations for those as well.      Dawnelle is cutting a section through the donut, L2004. The section shows that the donut only goes down about 5 cm. underneath, there is a layer of ash that extends into the area around the donut.       Phil, meanwhile, is excavating the pit L2009, which contains a few potsherds, some small bones, and a small piece of obsidian. He has not reached the bottom of the pit yet.      We had our workers and Jakob and Michaelle's dug about 10cm in L2005. Possible mud bricks appeared in the southern half, and we decided to dig 5 cm more on the northern side. We found a large pot sherd with a matching smaller one here, KT2055. Further to the west, we found a possible pot smash, not as complete as the earlier one in L2003. We assigned this KT 2053.       After looking at the donut section, we removed it and saved the eastern half of the soil for analysis. The ash layer continued under the donut. We designated a new locus 2012 for the ash area. The boundaries so far are indistinct. This locus cuts L 2011.      While reviewing our notebook this afternoon, we discovered a couple of problems. The first was that our elevations for the past two days are out of whack with those from previous days. We are not sure what caused this problem, but figure it could be due either to a transit that was moved without our knowledge, or to a transit that had been knocked out of level. Hopefully, if it is the former case, we will be able to fix our measurements by taking an elevation off the rocks that remain in the NE corner of the trench.      The other problem is that Dawnelle and Phil had some miscommunication about which locus was where. Consequently, some KT numbers were put in the wrong locus. We think we have this under control now, but will have to check the tags on our pottery from today. KT 2053 and 2055 are from L 2005, not from L 2011.      July 29, 2000      We found out this morning that the bad elevation snafu was stemming from an incident that occured on the afternoon of the 25th, when Phil was placed in charge of taking the measurements. The bad data is confined to the closing elevations for that day, and was possibly caused by an unlevel level. We will try to replace what measurements we can by taking elevations off the balk.      We scraped L 2005 in order to see what we could see. While we were doing this, our workmen brought L's 2007 and 2011 down approximately 10 cm, evening them out with the bottom of the section of L 2008 that was dug on the 26th.      Meanwhile, back in L 2005, we came across the top of a mudbrick wall running east-west through the approximate center of the locus. This wall was renamed L 2013. The area to the south was labelled 2014; that to the north was called L 2016. A small, clay lined pit discovered in the southwest of L 2014 was named L 2015.      The workmen then dug the eastern half of L 2014 to a depth of 20 cm.      L 2015, excavated by Dawnelle, was discovered to be a 34 cm diameter circle, lined with broken potsherds. Similar to the donut discovered some days ago (L 2004), the soil appeared burnt. Its color was established as reddish yellow, (6/6). Also like L 2004, the pit was rather shallow, terminating in a large rock which was continuous with L 2014.      While Dawnelle was digging L 2015, Phil was engaged in the painstaking excavation of several small ash pits located underneath loci 2011 and 2008 in the southeast corner of the trench. An arbitrary area, L 2017, was set up to include all of the pits, which were then excavated as if they were one larger pit.      After Dawnelle had completed excavating 2015, the workmen dug the remainder of L 2014, except for a small area along the south balk which may possibly be another mud brick wall.       July 30, 2000      We started the day by having our workmen attempt to flatten L 2014, so that we could look for mud brick and other neat stuff.      While this was going on, Phil continued digging in the pit, L 2009. Later, Bradley and Andy came by and told us to create new loci in the eastern half of the trench. The south side of the trench, under L 2011, will be L 2018. This area is mostly softer crumbly dirt. The north side of the trench, under L 2007 and the northern ~15cm of L 2011, will be called L 2019. This locus has areas of hard material, possibly mud brick debris. Other parts are similar to L 2018.      In addition, we are assigning a new locus number to the hard, mud brick like area in the eastern part of L 2016. It will now be known as L 2020.      July 31, 2000      We opened two new loci today L's 2021 &amp; 2022. Consisting of the two piles of rocks in the eastern half of the trench, these loci were excavated by Bradley (with the help of Betsy) in the space of approximately 2 minutes. We had quite a time corraling flying chunks of basalt, pottery and other miscellaneous heavy stuff. Not to mention trying to assign everything KT numbers. Anyway, after excavating around the rock piles on previous days, we had come to the conclusion that they were free floating and probably sitting on the same surface as our beautiful smashed pot.       L 2021, the area of rocks straddling L's 2018 &amp; 2019, contained the three chunks of grindstone assigned KT's 2074-2076. L 2022 is the area of rocks associated with the pot smash, and contained one large chunk of basalt.      After the morning's excitement, we settled back into our routine of straightening balks, sections, and floors. The mini balk around L 2009, created when 2018 was being dug, was removed. In addition, L 2020 and the southern part of L 2014 were troweled in the hope of discovering mud brick lines. The area in the middle of L 2014 is very soft and is quite possibly a pit. Once troweling and cleaning is complete, we may assign it another locus.      L 2014 is now closed. We found we think to be a section of wall heading north out of the S balk. This wall, L 2023, is interupted by the soft pittish area, L 2024. East of the pit and wall is now L 2025; to the west is L 2026.      After these numbers were assigned, we had the workmen dig the eastern half of 2013 down to the level of the mud bricks that we found in the north of what was L 2014. These bricks have been, for the time being, incorporated into L 2013. We are not sure if they are collapse, or if they represent the true line of the wall, as they veer off from the upper part of 2013.      August 1, 2000      We started out by sweeping the trench so that Drew could take a photgraph of the new Loci in the SW quadrant of the trench. After that business was complete, we chopped the northern third of L 2019 down to the level of L 2020, and straightened the balks and sections so that we could look for mud bricks again.      Erdan was put to work excavating a new pit in L 2018, L 2027.       Andy came by and said that L 2019 still didn't make any sense. There was a lot of slumpage, and no clear lines. To try and figure out what's going on, we are nowgoing to dig the rest of L 2019 down to the level of L 2020. The soil in this section appears to be compacted mud brick debris, with areas of looser crumbly soil.       While L 2019 was being dug, we also dug the remainder of the hump in L 2013, so that the entire wall was approximately level.      Drew came over and asked us to make him do manual labor, so we had him dig and scrape balks for a while.      After finishing digging L 2019, we dug the northern half of L 2018. Andy came by to look for mud brick, and then had us complete diggin L 2018 to the same level as L 2019 and L 2020.      August 2, 2000      We have Erdan's (sp?) brother today. We started by having him clean the balks while Matin dug in L 2024. We found a strange egg shaped vessel in this locus. Bradley and Andy came by to look at it and told us to dig L 2018 lower, so that it would be even with L 2013. We are trying to have Matin dig level, but don't know if he will, as he hasn't really ever been able to so far.      Bradley also noted that our pit L 2027 didn't totally correspond to the boundaries of the pit in the section. It was a little too big. We redefined the edges of the pit and made it a new locus, L 2028.       There is a possible mend for our egg shaped cup in KT 2099. Dawnell found a handle of an appropriate size for the cup yesterday.      Pit L 2024 was closed today after Dawnell reached the end of the loose soil which was its defining characteristic. The bottom surface of theit is the same hard packed mud that seems to be everywhere.      We continued scraping and picking L 2018 and L 2019 down to the level of L 2013. The wall, L 2013, now appears to continue into the eastern half of the trench. We are waiting for Andy and Bradley to come and take a look.      Also, we seem to have missed a pit in the southeast of L 2018, just north of our other pit L 2028. It appears to cut into the wall just discovered in L 2018.      When they finally arrived, Bradley and Andy sent off our workmen to dig at Ellie's trench. They were very impressed with our wall, which consists of three rows of bricks. The inner bricks are large and square, while those on the outside are as long, but half as wide. L 2020 looks like it may be a wall running north from L 2013 to the north balk, and L 2023 looks like it might run south from L 2013 to the south balk, cut in the middle by L 2024, the pit.      After Bradley and Andy left, Dawnell started digging L 2028, which yielded a few bits of pottery and bone. The soil remained loose and dark until the level of the wall, at which point it became the omnipresnet hard mud fill once more.      L 2020 was scraped by Phil so that it was flat and even with L 2019. It is looking more and more like a wall running perpendicular to L 2013, of the same construction and thickness.       August 5, 2000      There has been a change in personnel. Phil has gone to work with Jakob in B1-3 and then to his own trench. Brian has come to this trench to do an intensive search for mudbrick lines in L-2013.      We took closing elevations for August 2 this morning. It was too windy to hold the level straigt on the second. We were gone the third and fourth for lab and rest days respectively.      Brian and I spent the time until breakfast scraping L-2013. We are trying to find good lines to create a continuous wall connected to the mud bricks in L-2018. L-2013 is a few centimeters higher than the developing wall in L-2018 so most of the pre-breakfast time was focused on taking the elevation down so that continuous lines would be recognizeable.      The post-breakfast scraping was fruitless. We concluded that L-2013 was still too high and the lines were covered with slump. We had the workmen hand pick a few centimeters deeper.      We removed the pot smash in L-2016. The elevations in the notebooks look odd, but they are correct. The first piece removed was a sherd standing on its edge, KT 2102. The top elevation was originally taken from this top edge because it was assumed that it was just one big, nice sherd. As we dug we found the other lower pieces which had an elevation of 95.76, KT 2024. As the area around the wall decreased in elevation we were able to remove the remaining sherds.      Brian continued looking for lines in L-2013. I began scraping L-2020 in the hopes that we could find lines which would connect it perpendicularly to L-2013. As of the end of the day there was no absolute connection and no good lines as well.      August 6, 2000      We began by sweeping. This was followed by more scraping after a fight with Jakob because he sent his worker minion over to our trench to steal our trowels. It turned out to be a moot point because we sent our workers away to help open the new trenches.      I also shot 2 closing elevation points for yesterday. They looked obviously wrong. I think I misheard when the number was originally shouted out. The new numbers fit correctly.      Brian has pulled up some good lines in the western half and central area of L-2013. I'm still working on L-2020. I've handpicked about 3cm because it is above the level that the lines appeared in L-2013.      I decided to make the mudbricks in the east their own locus. They do not exactly match the wall that is L-2013. So for better control this wall is now L-2029.      August 7, 2000      The grindstone pictured on the day plans is sticking out of the balk. Since I'm well below it I'll stop picturing it. At the end of the season we may try and remove it from the balk, but right now that would be hazardous to the straight balk situation.      The pit L-2024 that cut the wall stub L-2023 may have mud brick debris at the bottom. Perhaps part of the wall connecting it perpendicularly to L-2013 exists at this lower elevation.      This probably should have been done yesterday, but I'm doing it now. Since the wall in the eastern half of the trench is a new locus L-2029 the areas it abuts and cuts are now new loci as well. To the north once L-2019, is now L-2030. The south, L-2018, has become :-2031. The area in the north west quadrant that is enclosed in walls 2013 and 2020 was once L-2016. It is now L-2032.      We sprayed this morning. You can see mud bricks in the section. We also saw in the very south eastern corner of the trench what appears to be a pit. So it seems the pit we closed there earlier should not have been closed. Thankfully we haven't dug in the surrounding locus since we closed that previous pit. So I have opened it in the incarnation of l-2033. The whole corner seems to be part of a gigantic pit system. I won't dig it for a while because I'm focusing of articualting the walls and any associated surfaces.      Andy speculates, and it seems plausible to me, that L-2029 was an older wall cut by the \""L\"" shape of L-2013 and L-2020. The 2 wall system is a lighter gray and is narrower. They appear to have the 2 square brick construction. L-2029 has the square-rectangle-square 3 course brick construction.       I'm digging the north half of L-2031, 20cm. Then I'll check the section and if nothing appears take down the southern half.       No floor in first half. Two whacks with the pick into the southern half reveals a beautiful potsmash, KT 2132. Now we're articulating it. We'll get a photo. Means while we'll push down 20 cm in L-2030.      Th potsmash turned out to be two potsmashes. The rims are separate but the body sherds are all mixed up in context. Both seem to be IA. The sherds will be bagged together. The thickness of the sherds should help indicate which piece is from which pot. Sherds from this smash may have appeared at an earlier elevation and been bagged with the general pottery in KT 2131. I also think there are pieces of the potsmash in L-2016. It was KT 2101 and 2124. These sherds which appeared at the same coordinants but a lower elevation were bagged as KT 2133. None of these were removed today as 60 Minutes drpped by and wanted to film them. From bitch of the tepe to show trench. Oh ya baby. They will be removed tomorrow.      I pushed down in L-2030. Nothing came up but I articulated the fallen piece of mud brick from L-2029 better.      August 8, 2000      I had Drew take another pot smash photo and then I took them out this morning. Metin is leveling the area they were sitting on.      I've gone down 10-15 cm in L-2030. Nothing's coming up yet. We'll just keep following the wall down.      There are some rocks with pottery sitting around in L-2031. They may be a pit, but I don't know. I'll trowel around there. Then we can push down in that locus. L-2031 may be an outside locus in relation to the wall. If that is so the large pit system currently in the form of L-2033 makes sense.      Turns out that the rocks and pottery are yet another pot smash. I am truly the pot smash queen. The elevation has been taken so I'm taking them out. It was only a few sherds. Nothing fantastic. In the context was a pestle. I small finded (found?) it and gave it KT 2142.      Pit L-2033 has been cut level to the surface of L-2031. The pit may have been chopped into L-2031 perhaps contaminating the pottery in KT 2140. I'm continuing the leveling process west into L-2025 which abuts L-2031. I'm trying to see more courses of bricks in L-2029 and L-2013. I also cut off the one fallen brick on the north of L-2029. We're cleaning the north section for a cleaner view there.      There appear to be mud bricks in the north balk of L-2032, near where it abuts wall L-2020. I can't find them on the current surface of L-2032. I don't know if we just chopped them out or if we caught the edge of the bricks and they extend north into the balk. It might be a wall parallel to L-2013 and L-2029. At this point we're just not sure.      I have also leveled L-2026. I left the wall stub L-2023 alone hoping that we could connect it to L-2013 at a lower course. At this point the bottome of pit L-2024 doesn't seem much different than the surrounding loci. I have split it between L-2025 and L-2026.      The last hour was spent straightening balks, cutting in close to the walls to see sections, and cleaning.      August 9, 2000      Drew took a photo first thing this morning to show all that had been dug yesterday.      Erdol dug L-2033 20cm. Metin cleaned around L-2023 to once again look for lines.      Mud brick is coming up in L-2030 near to wall L-2029 on the northern side. The southern side has an area of hardness which may be bricks or tumble.      Andy came and we scraped L-2029 and L-2013 looking for courses.      I pushed down L-2031 20cm, level with the pit, L-2033. I left the hard area alone so we can look for lower courses and determine if its a wall or not.      Pushed down 20 cm in the northern half of L-2030. Ever slowly and stealthily I'll move closer to the mud brick, exposing it and looking for lower courses.      Came up with a neat sherd in L-2031. It was painted and incised with a weird \""N\"" or \""S\"" shape. Turns out it's Hellenistic. It was found near the edge of the gigantic pit, L-2033, so that could account for its appearance in an elevation that has been pulling up Iron Age pottery.      A nice ash layer showed up in L-2033. I got a soil sample of it, KT 2159.      There are some areas of really loose dirt in L-2030. I didn't change locus because the rest of the overall matrix still seems to be the same. However I'm doing a controlled dig of the area in case it turns out the be a pit or something.      Finally met up with the mid brick in L-2030. I straightened the section. We're working on all the wall sections and then we'll sweep well. Then I'll have Andy come and scrutinize everything.      There were a couple of rocks in L-2032 that have been there for 2 days. I looked at them with Andy today and decided they're grindstones. KT 2166 is basalt and KT 2167 is some other type of stone. I took their elevations, measured them, and made them small finds.      Pushed down 10cm in L-2025. Founds some small accretions of coarse grained sand. They didn't turn out to be anything.      Andy chopped down the mud brick in L-2031. It was just tumble. Then he chopped into the wall. The courses are now beautifully visible. There are three visible so far on the south. I'm chopping into the northern side as well as t"120,2000-08-15," B-1-2000-08-015-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1,","B-1-2000   7/21/2000      After a long time we marked off the square. We dug 10 cm into Locus 1000 an area roughly one third of the square, finding a few bones and some pottery, but no lithics. The topsoil was dark tightly packed soil, with weeds on top.    We let the workers dig about 10 cm too far and too fast. We did not detect the change in soil color until the workmen had cleared the full third of the trench. When they began to dig the rest of the square we found a layer of hard packed, grey clay (which we first believed to be mudbrick), this we named Locus 1001. We spent a few hours clearing the rubble from the trench and scraping the thin dark top soil off the clay layer.   By the end of the day we began clearing the hard packed clay and at the same time trying to level the square. We managed to clean and \level\ 2/3 of the trench, finding numerous pottery sherds in the process.   Due to the chaos of the day we were only able to take one elevation at the beginning of the first locus. We have the opportunity to catch up on elevations tomorrow as the levels have not changed significantly.      7/22/2000   We forgot our dig bag this morning but were able to borrow materials from the neighboring trench. We took elevations for Locus 1001 using the stadia rod method instead of the line level method we used previously. To remain consistent we recalculated our measurements for Locus 1000 from the baulk. We cleared the rest of Locus 1001 and found several animal bones and pieces of pottery.    Among the finds were a piece of overfired ceramic, which was labled small find KT#1006, it was found in the SE-corner of the square. We decided to close locus 1001 and began sweeping and cleaning it. Here after we (MS) marked of a sounding area, which was labled locus 1002, along the East baulk (1.4 m) we dug about 10 cm. The finds from this locus were mostly bones (KT# 1008) and many pieces of pottery ( KT#1007).   The dirt was the of the same kind as in locus 1001. Though there seemed to be areas filled with a loser dirt type, but these are relatively small and irregular, they could not be considered pits. Some of the dirt was more massive and hard (tough dirt) which maybe mudbrick-tumble? As we cleaned the locus 1002 we uncovered 7 large potsherds which we thought may be part of several pot smashes. That was not the case so we plotted, photographed and removed them. Near the North East Baulk we plotted some reddish clay within grey hard clay that may be a crushed potsherd or clay that had been exposed to fire. We began to clean the rubble from Locus 1002 and prepared to even out the trench.    While sweeping over Locus 1002 a workman swept some more of Locus 1001 and uncovered a small round white body sherd laying flat. We decided that it was still in Locus 1001 and we plotted and removed it.    We changed to L. 1003, because we thougth there was slight change in soil color. Most likely we thought that there was a pit or oven somewhere and were concerned about the slight changes in soil composition. We now know that Locus 1002 and 1003 are the same and we have indicated that on our records. There were large rocks strewn about Locus 1003 that we hoped would indicate some architecture, as well as more soft dark fill that we had encountered in the previous locus. After spending a lot of time scraping the floor looking for some architecture we gave up and conferred with our dig supervisors. We were told that we had nothing and we should just blast our way another 15 cm.    We opened Locus 1004 on the North East wall of the trench digging about 10 cm and then we dug another 20 cm in a 1 x 1m sounding in the North East corner. We will extend this to the rest of the trench tomorrow. So far the soil and contents have not changed.      7/23/2000   We began to expand the deep part of locus 1004, (KT#1013-1017) so it would fill one half of the trench (2x4m). Seeing no change within the soil, we continued to expand the deep area into the other half of the trench. All hope seemed to be lost, when one the workmen (Asiz) uncovered a series of rocks running from the South baulk towards the West baulk. It became clear to us that this most likely some sort of foundation and we decided to label it as locus 1005 (KT# 1018-1019)( JPP named the wall-foundations \Asiz_Ñés Wall\ ). The small area between the wall and the SW-corner became locus 1006 (KT# 1020-1022). After the identification of these loci much of the work was directed into cleaning / leveling the trench. While doing this we uncovered two very small spots of different soil types, one within the wall, which had a yellowish color and the other along the North baulk, which had a grey color very much like the soil around it. These \spots\ seem to be made of coarse sand (very much like the sand we today use for concrete) which was entirely different from the surrounding clay. Adjacent to the East side of the wall foundation, in Locus 1004, was what we thought might be some mudbrick. We took a sample and labeled it KT 1020, we decided that it probably wasn't mudbrick so we dug through the layer and leveled the trench. Along the western baulk (locus 1004) we also found large pieces of pottery, which still sit in situ. They appear to be parts of storage vessels.       07/24/2000   We started the day by taking elevations. On the advice of Andy on the previous day, who suggested that the material below the wall on either side would be different than the material above it. We opened three new loci using the wall as a dividing line. The first was on the south west side of the wall which had previously been part of 1006, we sunk a .5 x .5 meter sounding 20cm deep trying to find another course of rocks that would indicate the size of the wall/foundation in the adjacent locus 1008. We did not find any new layers, but we did find various pot sherds and bones imbeded in clay beneath the stones.   On the east side of the wall we opened a 1m wide sounding 20cm deep from the south east corner of the trench directly up to the wall. We called this Locus 1007. Adjacent to the wall we found numerous pot sherds scattered like debris just at the surface of the Locus 1007. We straightened the south baulk closest the wall trying to find more layers of the wall, Locus 1008. As with Locus 1009, we found only pot sherds. While trying to level Locus 1007 along the wall we came upon a suspicious number of pot sherds that may have indicated a pot smash. We decided to dig around those sherds, leaving them articulated and started focusing on the middle of the Locus1007. We marked off a 1m square sounding for the middle of the trench and immediately came upon a pile of large rocks 10cm below the wall surface in Locus 1008. We followed the rocks through the middle of the trench hoping to find more foundations. We spent the rest of the afternoon following them across to the north east part of the trench.   While this was going on, Michaelle began straightening the edges of the sounding done that morning on the south east corner, and she came upon a group of large pot sherds and a lot of fired clay lodged about 5cm above the bottom of Locus 1007. It resembles a large pot smash that Bradley thinks is typical Early Iron Age. We found a handle and numerous large body and rim sherds stacked on each other in the layer. We began to clean this area immediately while still following the wall in the middle of the trench.   Here's where it gets complicated.    While digging close to the wall in Locus 1007 we found what appeared to be another smashed pot, more delicate than the first. We uncovered a handle, body sherds, and a small cylindrical piece artculated along the east side of the wall 5cm below the wall's surface. Part of the crew was assigned to clean this area as well.   All this time we were still trying to find the rest of our new wall. We finally came upon some softer soil 3m east of the west wall, as well as some ash (which Aziz seems to think is wood ash) and some over fired clay. We took soil samples of the clay (KT 1032) and ash (KT 1031) which we think were contaminated because of the plastic bags we had to put them in. (Doh!) We will take more samples tomorrow in aluminum foil. We think that these materials indicate a pit of some sort so we decided to dig a sounding to the north of the \pit\ to outline its size. We found lots of large and small bone as well as more clay and ash. These materials do not extend all the way to the north wall they seem to stop very close to where we originally found them. We named the fill that we found the ash/bone/clay in as Locus 1010. When we dig for the bottom of the pit tomorrow we will give the pit itself a locus of its own.   We spent the rest of the time cleaning and looking worried because we hadn't taken any measurements due to the large number of finds. We will compensate for that tomorrow morning.       7/25/2000   We began the day by making a conserted effort to keep up with our notebook. We took bottom elevation on all loci. Then we remeasured the debris of stones/pottery and the west pot smash.We started by digging in the north west area of Locus1007 trying to follow the debris. When we discovered many small stones and some pottery in this area we dug further towards the west baulk and came upon some very soft soil that had no rocks within it. We thought we might have another pit and started a new KT#1042 for pottery and KT# 1043 for bone. About .5 m out from the north baulk we found some mudbrick debris so we isolated that area for futher investigation. We changed the locus along the East baulk to Locus1011 ( at this point JPP felt very tired ) JPP had so far been working on the heap of pot sherds in locus 1011.   Drew came by and helped us prepare the trench for photos, after the photos were taken, we lowered Locus1007 (Easten edge) 5 cm, to search for more of the rocky debris or cobblestone floor. One of the workmen found the time teach us a little Turkish, especially the words small and large.   We continued the search for debris from the west baulk towards the SE-corner. Aziz, while digging, came upon a floor in the NW corner of the 1007-area, and the search began to find more of this floor, we began tracing this (in small chunks) all over Locus1007. We also found another concentration of pot sherds at the Southern part of Locus 1007 which we half heartedly cleaned because we found it so late in the day. Bradley-bay came by to tell us that he thought that the pottery and rock debris in Locus 1007 may have occured before the wall in Locus 1008 was built. This makes sense considering that after we cleaned the wall thoroughly we thought the debris continued under the wall as opposed to being debris from the wall itself. We decided that our next step would be to thoroughly map and draw the trench as it stood as well as trying to find where the debris ended in the trench. We want to lift the rocks from the wall and the floor as soon as possible so that maybe we can find the floor surface beneath.      7/26/2000   We began the day taking the elevations and cleaning the trench for a publiciable photo. After spraying the remains of locus 1004 to see if it was mudbrick, it turned out to be normal clay after this became clear we closed locus 1004. After hours of cleaning, our most esteemed leader informed us, that we could not take the (damn-) photo. We covered L.1004 with grain sacks and more dirt.   Then we leveled locus 1011 of, by digging 5 cm on both sides of the potsmash ( now called locus 1013) we also defined locus 1012 as the potsmash in middle of locus 1007, which might be located in a pit because of the soft soil surrounding it. (Andy doesn't think so but we cornered it off anyway). We ended the day by cleaning, taking elevations and measurments of the loci/features in the trench.      SUMMARY 7/21/2000 - 7/26/2000      We had a slow start but we are getting the hang of it now. Our biggest problem is elevations. There are few loci with out proper elevations. Fortunatly they are the topmost levels of ...... little is ...., of course this no excuse. When wee got the notebook talk from Andyour workload doubled. We had to redo everything, make sure that we described all our soil with the Munsell chart.   As for the loci:   L. 1000 - Topsoil w/scattered potsherds and bone, no lithics. The pottery is a mix of EIA, IA and possible Hellenistic.   L. 1001 - Most likely a continuation of the topsoil. Scattered bones and pottery dating mostly to EIA &amp; IA. One striking piece of pottery, was a pale colored sherd with red paint, the date of this peice is still not clear. We found a few cobbles \floating\ in the soil.   L. 1002=L.1003 - We were so anxious to find something that we haked without taking elevations, soil coloration and such things. We changed locus from L.1001 to L.1002, because the soil seemed harder packed. Then while digging L.1002, we thought we saw a change in soil color, so we changed locus to L.1003. Now we know that L.1002=L.1003, and then we leveled them.    The pottery was a lot IA stuff, with a nipple base among the finds from L.1002 and some Late/Hellenistic stuff in L.1003.   In the SW corner of L.1003 we found some cobbles running from the south baulk towards the west baulk of the trench. When we realized this was a cobblestone foundation, we changed loci.   L.1004 - This is the fill east of the wall above the level of the of the cobbles. We had so much pottery scattered around this locus , that we had to give it 2 KT#   L.1005 - This is the fill above the wall foundation. Lots pottery and bone.   L.1006 - This locus is the fill west of the wall foundation, surprizing few finds compared to L.1005 and L.1004. Among the few finds was one peice of EIA painted ware.   L. 1007 - This is the fill that started at the level of the Wall foundation (L.1008) and continiued down wards from there. We quickly came upon a more compactly packed layer of pottery, silt and stones (collaps?), we then tried to follow this collaps, making it the bottom of L.1007 (and the top of a furture locus), we then continued the locus beyond the collaps debris, the finds from this continuation got its own KT#s. Just outside the debris we uncovered what could be a pit (L.1010)   L. 1008 - The foundation wall, one course of cobblestones, in 3-4 rows.   L. 1009 - A sounding made at the bottom of L. 1006, the idea being that we would be able to get more detailed strata. info.   L. 1010 - A possible pit, but when we got around to excavating it was only a thin layer of soft dirt covering a hard packed soil. Then we closed the locus.   L. 1011 - We changed to this locus because when we began to dig in this area, we hit very hard silt, containing many potsherds (what later became L. 1013) The soil produced many potsherds and a few lithics.   L. 1012 - This could be a bottom of a pit we missed in an earlier layer. It contained a lot of potsherds and basalt stones.   L 1013 - This is the potsmash with in L.1011.      7/28/2000   We began the day with cleaning the trench for our first Plan photo, this operation took the whole morning. After Breakfirst it became clear that Drew was not ready to take the plan photo yet. We then decided, together with Andi &amp; Bradley, that we should start another trench next to B1, primerily this trench should trace L. 1008. So we spent the rest of the day laying out the new square. The special thing about these two, was(is) that they shared a .5m wide baulk. We only opened B3 as a half trench.      7/29/2000   Damn Diabetes, Jakob was not able to be at the dig today.    After a long talk to Andi last nigth, about the (pittyful) state of our notebook...   After clearing the the trench for yet another final photo, Michaelle spent the rest of the day redoing the notebook, Munselling ect.   We did not dig anything today.      7/30/2000   A lot happened today. Jakob came back and we began taking up the pottery from L.1014 (KT# 1053,1057,1072) along with a lot of other finds (KT#1054-1056,1058-1068, 1071,1073-1075). Among this were 10 finds of basalt tools.   We also decided that the baulk between trench B1 and B3 should be excaveted, at least down to the foundation wall. To avoid spill of soil in to Loci (3001 and 1014) we were going to take soil samples from and sift later. We decided, with advice from Andi, to make small buffer zones/miniature baulks, 10cm wide, that later would be taken down as well. The Northern part, where we wanted to protect L.1014, became Locus 1016 and the southern part, protecting 3001, became Locus1015. Apart from working on the baulk-loci, we also sifted the dirt from L.1014, looking for artifacts. And with great success, many small potsherds and bones. After this we took soil samples.   In L.1016 we did find a continuation of the cobble foundation wall, found in L.1008 and L.3002.   At the end of the day, we hadn't been able to complete the digging in the baulk. But this happen tomorrow.      7/31/2000   Today was tough in Trench B1. We opened 5 new loci and used over 30 KT# to hold th finds. We began the day by lifting all the debris from L.1013, the potsmash by the East baulk. Consisted of nummerous large potsherds and a few animal bones, There wasn't any soil to sift, and very little for the soil sample. While L. 1013 was taken away, work was continued on the rest of the west baulk in L.1015 &amp; L.1016.   Jakob was told by Bradley, that the burial had to go today, so he spent all his time working on L.1015, where we found the burial/pit, which became another locus L.1019. In the north end of the West baulk, where the large cobbles were situated we finished excavating.   Now we were able to see the entire wall foundation, which seems to be sloping sligthly upwards. After this we cleaned the entire series of cobbles for a photo. After this we opened a small locus (L.1020) on the East side of the baulk, by cutting through L.1016, to the level of L.1014-L.1017. This was done to study the strata under the foundation.   L.1014-L.1017:   Yesterday we closed L.1014, the debris east of L.1008. Today we opened L.1017 as a surface/floor locus of the debris and began systematically looking for a floor layer. We began articulating some soft spots around the floor, which migth be other floor levels. Along the border of the debris we came upon some unusual soft dirt, thinking it could be a pit we gave it L.1018, just in case. Instead of one pti we found numerous small animal (mouse?) holes/tunnels, that went very deep below the hard surface, this was disapointing to say the least.We left the mice to their own doings and continued digging L.1017 in hope of finding another floor level. We started in the southern end, going 5 cm down, seeing no surface we continued going another10cm, here we hit a hard surface, near L.1008. Tracining that, we moved to the middle of L.1017, Just after digging 10cm we discovered a great deal of burnt clay and black burn marks, 2-3cm beloow the surface. The abundance of burnt clay and burn marks surgest there was an oven sitting dirrectly on the floor. We also found several flint flakes (some of them had a pinkish tone, sugesting exposure to high temperatures) Aziz's theory that these stone flakes were used to cut straws in the fields. We diecided to skip the oven surface for the fine ? and concentraded on the rest of the floor. Very closeto the suface (2-3cm) we found a hard floor, spreading to the rest of L.1017 revealing ever more debris such as large potsherds and pebblesas well as cobbles fill from the previous level. While leveling L.1017 we ? potsherds from L.1012 at the soutern end of the trench. We bagged all the of the pottery, a few bones and all the (very heavy basalt) small finds, and saved the rest of the dirt as a soil sample. Our trench looks rather barren now, with only the wall and a few scattered cobbles lying about.         8/1/2000   We opened the by looking at the trench in dismay. What were we to do? We have a hole lot of rubble and some floors, which seem to be endless, but contain nothing useful. We cleaned L.1017 for a last photo of the surface, before we could chop further. While this was going on we named everything East of L.1008 and L.1017 (L. 1023) for L.1021. We started digging at the western most point, where L.1008 and L.1021 meet, digging from there towards the west baulk, turning north when we reached the western baulk. We did not find another floor/surface10 cm down. Up on reaching the North baulk, we did find a pit. Which contained vastly looser soil, so decided to define its edges rigth away, hoping that it is not animal holes again, but we found some bone spilters, scaring the living daylights out of us (Did we accidently ploug through another deader?) Instead when we defined the pit L.1022 we found to be 30cm deeb, all dirt was sifted and there were taken samples of it. At the bottom we found another pile of thrash (potsherds and bones), this was left there. As there were more \important\ (can't remember why?) work to do... We made sure that in L.1021 we sifted 1:5 buckets of dirt, because we didn't want to loose all the important small finds.   As we began to dig the bottom of L.1017/the top of L.1023 we sifted all the dirt (WE DO NOT LIKE SIFTING, it's boring). Ofcourse we ende up finding something cool 1/2 hour before we should leave. As Aziz was cleaning L.1023 (sweeping) he found a nice little stone bowl, just a few cm below the surface. We noted its possition, but left it standing, because it could be standing on a surface, which we hadn't uncovered.       8/2/2000   The morning began with our usual elevation argument. (What locus is that? ect. ect.) We began to level L.1023, chopping about 5 cm through the middle around the rocks on the North baulk.We were trying to find out what kind layers there were bellow the floor (more floors?) We began to bring up more the the overfired clay and ash. We came upon some small circles of ash surrounded by a ring of overfired clay. As opposed to the usual sporadic occurance of the material near the rocks. We took a carbon sampleof ash and charcoal and conferred with Bradley on what the circles migth be. He said that they were the bottom of destroyed oven. We then articulated those areas of burnt ash and leveled the rest of L.1023. We still were sifting every peie of dirt in L. 1023, which slowed us down considerably. While working on L.1023 we also finished articulating the middle part of the foundation in L.1016, so we could get the last photo.   We are dying to chop up the foundation in L.1008, it's been around long enough. We also removed L.1006, so only L.1009 is the only locus at the west side of the foundation, to find the rest of the strata. We found the same mix of stuff, as we last itm we dug in this part of the trench (nothing), but a few sherds. The debris doesn't seem to continue on the west side of the foundation.   Back to L.1023, we are not sure what's going on. We found another group of potsherds, on the western most point, which we atticulated, thinking it migth lie on a new floor/surface. That is yet to decided. ???? 5 cm below the surface of the rock group by the north baulk, there doesn't seem to be anything burnt clay and ash under the stones.   About L.1020:   We opened a sounding at the east side of L.1016 in the baulk that separates B1 from B3 and called it L.1020, because it representates the material below the wall surface. We found a few large cobbles and a potsherd laying flat. This is probably tumble.      8/5/2000   Started the day with a new man in the trench, Michaelle had been rotated out, and now I have Phil to deal with... The first thing I did was to lable the semi-circle of stones along the North baulk L. 1024, this should have been done days ago.........   Then we had one of the workmen level L.1023, while we measured in the part of L.1008, we were going to cut away, to do further study of the strata. Especially the relations between the foundation and the floor layers. This cut was labled L.1025.   After breakfirst Jakob had stomach-cramps and had to retreat from the site.   The work in B3 was continued by Aziz, after which he helped in cleaning L.1023, while Phil excavated L.1025, and leveled it with L.1021. Taner Re-cleaned L. 1022, which had been filled with dust during the 8/3, storm. At this point Aziz made fun of Phils Turkish skills.   While scraping down L.1023, we came upon a pit in the NW corner of the trench. The soil is very dark and ashy, and very soft. The whole ting was cleared, leaving a pit with a sloping bottom of a hard paked soil. In the pit was found a small cylinder seal.       8/6/2000   Today I was given the complete command over this trench and its two workmen Aziz and Taner, unfortunatly I had to give Ali to another trench.   Started the day by taking elevations. After which decided to close L.1024, by removing the stones. There by opening a new L.1029, which is the dirt between the stones and the bottom level of L.1023. Found some pottery with this soil (KT# 1139).   Then had 2 new loci created, both with objective to find the\floors\ as seen in the Loci L.1022 and L.1026, which I closed at the same time. Then had the workmen dig the 20 cm it would take.   Soon discovered that there were no floors/surface, and the color difference between the two parts of the trench still is there. The 2 loci were L.1027, which is below L.1023, and L.1028, which is below L.1021.   Iam not finding anything..........Andi calls it a middle phase   The rest of day was spent on leveling the trench....... which will take a couple of days.      8/7/2000   Due to total misunderstanding of notebook/dayplan system, I spent the morning remasuring the trench. While Aziz and Taner continued to work with leveling the trench.   After breakfirst I went back to Bismil and started redoing/retyping the notebook.      8/8/2000   Still typing, miss my trench, the sun, the dust, the tepe...................   Went \MWHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH\ while typing, I am no longer depressed.      8/12/2000   Around 11 o'clock we began work at trench B1 againg. We started to level off L1027 and L1028. During which I removed the two potsmashes from L1027, KT#1155 &amp;1156. Then the baulks were straightned and the trench was sweeped. We are still finding oven pieces in L1027.      8/13/2000   We started the day by removing the sourthern section of L1008, this was done by dividing the soil into layers and loci that resembled the loci on the eastern side og the wall, so L1030 = (some of) L1007, L1021=L1031 and L1028=L1032, L1025 was closed and the soil beneath it was part of L1032. The following Loci was opened and closed in the process L1030, L1031 and L1032, and I closed L1025.   I then extended L1028 to cover the area of the southern section.   Have begun to dig L1028 another, seem to have hit an area of some ashy stuff, will dig more carefull and scrape afterwards.   Jeg foeler mig noget traet efter gaarsdagens solskin.   Removed the cobbles from the northern section of L1008, and there by closing it, used the same procedure as used in southern section, opening and closing loci L1033, L1034 and L1035, decided to extend L1027 under L1035.   After this we were sweating a lot, because it was VERY HOT and a bit humid.    Then closed L1009 and opening L1036 under it, removed the dirt and extended L1028 under L1036, there by closing L1036.    After this we cleaned/sweeped the trench, in doing so we discovered a posible pit and a potsmash in L1027, along the north baulk.      8/14/2000   Started the day by digging the pit (discovered yesterday), as L1037 and took a soil sample, in doing so I discovered that it was a thin layer of dust................I then stopped the paperwork on L1037, and cancelled that locus, so I could use the number later.   After this we dug 10 cm in L1028, while Djengis articulated the potsmash in L1027, finding that the most of the pot was in the baulk, and will be completly removed at a later date.   While scraping around the potsmash, we uncovered a \big-ass\ sherd, KT 1188.   I am beginning to believe that the 2 loci I have are very similar and maybe equal, therefore we began to level the whole trench.    As we were ploughing through the soil of L1027 we turned up, 2 very preserved pots. One a small nipplebased cup, the other a some what coarse piece of kitchen ware (?).   As we were cleaning for photo of the two pots, we uncovered a rectangular pit in the NW corner of L1027, naming it L1037 (due to lack of locus sheets.......must remember!) After cleaning, Bradley came by and outlined several pits in the trench, and advising me to close L1027 and L1028, which I then did. I will assign new loci tomorrow.       8/15/2000   Started the day by assigning new loci for the entire trench (see day plan #17).   L1039 is a small pit in the eastern part of the trench, much of the soil seem to be ashy.   L1038 is a large pit dominating the south western corner of the trench.    L1040 is the remaining soil from L1027, located between L1039   and the East baulk.    The rest of the trench was labled L1041 and L1042.    Then we began sifting the remaning material from L1037, plus taking soil samples from it, soon after this it seemed that we reached the bottom of the pit, the soil looked like the soil of L1042 (anot. In doing so I took final elevations and closed L1037.   Then I had the baulks straigthened. (Damn I have a headache, can't consentrate) Began to dig L1040, bringing it to the level of L1042 and then closing it.   Then I turned to L1039, and began to dig it, took 5 bags of soil samples. We found potsherds from 1 or 2 large pots in the pit, plus a lot of \cÕó_b\, Djengis was a bit too overzealous with \Bessie\ and cut the walls of the bit so the last of the pottery bags is probably mixed goods.   After this we began more well coordinated work on the large pit in South west corner, L1038, we sifted 7 buckets of dirt out of 20 buckets, and took 6 (medium) bags of soil samples. The L1038 pit seems to be softest and deepest in the Eastern end. As I was scraping through that area of the locus, I found a single stone bead.   After this we closed for the day, of corse we sweeped the entire area.          Trench Summary    for B1.   Trench B1 was opened on the 7/21, it was marked off as a 5x5 m square, where the active field was 4x4 m, leaving the rest for the baulk.   The topsoil was named L1000, which we excavated at once, it was only a few cm's deep, before we changed locus to L1001, because of a change in soil coloration.   Seeing that we were finding nothing, except a sligth colorchange, we split the trench into two Loci, L1002 and L1003, after digging we saw that there was no change in the soil color, and we made them equal, while cotinuating digging L1003, we turned up an aligment of rocks, we immidiatly changed loci to L1004, which was the fill on the NE side of it. L1005, being the soil on top of the wall, that later was named L1008. L1006 being the fill on the west side of the wall. After leveling the trench, we changed loci again to L1007, being the soil below the wall L1008, on the other side of the wall L1009, a small triangular locus, like L1006, which it was located below.   The next couple of days we focused on L1007, excavating in the area, we found a layer of debris, this made us change loci to L1014, which became the debris, this area of debris was located in the North-western part of the trench. Along the East trench we uncovered a high consentration of potsherds, a so called \potsmash\, we then renamed that part of the trench L1011, to catch the entire potsmash, right west of this potsmash, we thought we had a pit, L1010, which turned out to be nothing. Later, having defined the potsmash in L1011, we decided to give it its own locus, L1013. The same day we had uncovered another potsmash, naming it L1012     ,~dc-terms:title: B-1-2000-08-015-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 1,"121,2000-08-15," B-2-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2013,","   August 15, 2000      Today is my last digging day, sniff sniff. I will miss Erdal and Metin. In preparation for closing I have done a number of things.      We hacked off the tiny stub of L-2020. It is gone and closed. We also hacked off all of L-2013, even passed the one mudbrick we had been saving.      I undercut the bottom levels of the wall L-2029 another 10cm but the courses don't extend that far. The wall is about 20 cm above the floor so the contexts don't go together      We articulated the rocks, L-2038. They may be part of a foundation for the wall we missed in the north baulk.      We scraped the floor thus closing pit L-2034. As we extend the floor L-2037 will be closed. We picked 10cm in L-2037 and L-2032 in an attempt to extend the floor. It reached through the end of L-2037, but not into L-2032.      We didn't get the plan photo done today. There was so much to scrape to extend the floor. Tomorrow we'll clean really well and maybe bash some more in L-2030. Then we'll get the pland and the work will be finished.      Closed L-2037. The floor is now L-2039 and encompasses that entire area.      Closed L-2032 and L-2020. Called the area L-2040. As we push into L-2030 later it may become part of it.      Closed L-2036. Met up with a rock layer so the pit stops. Made the forthcoming rocks part of the floor L-2039.        ,~: B-2-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2013,"122,2000-08-15," D-2-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2010,","   August 15, 2000      We are starting off today by finishing the excavation of L 2010, so that it is level with the rest of the western half of the trench. When that is complete, we will cleanup the trench and try and make sense of of the situation in the western half.       After digging and cleaning, we encountered no evidence that L 2010 was part of a wall. However, on the brighter side, it became apparent that the rocks uncovered yesterday in the southern half of L 2011 are actually part of a cobble surface. We troweled and explored the area a little further, and found definite edges to the surface. It does not cover a particularly large area, but it appears to be extending into the eastern half of the trench. In order to follow the surface, we are opening a section of the eastern half of the trench as L 2012. This locus appears equal to L 2001.      After L 2012 was dug and cleaned, we noticed that the surface appeared to continue further into the eastern half of the trench, but became consistently narrower as it continued. In order to try and figure out what was going on, we decided to extend L 2012 to cover the entire eastern half of the trench, and dig it down level with the surface. It should also be mentioned that an area of discolored soil was found in L 2012 near the center of the trench--possibly more oven residue.      Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the excavation of L 2012 before the workday was over, so the extent and overall shape of the surface is still unclear. At this stage, it appears that it may be triangular in shape. It also includes quite a few potsherds.     ,~: D-2-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2010,"123,2000-08-15," F-2-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2007,","   15 August 2000   The plan for today is to articulate the surface L2008. i will also trowel around L2009 and L2007 to see what is going on in those loci. I'll probably have the workers take down L2009, possibly 5-10cm.   I looked around and decided to have the workers go 10cm down on L2009. I'm beginning to wonder if L2008 is a new surface or just a continuation of L2003. There were about 5cm of soil between them, but L2009 appears to follow the same plan as L2003. One difference is the composition. L2008 is made up of small rocks approximately 5*6cm. i don't see any of the cobblestones that characterized L2003.   After talking to Bradley we decided that today will be my last day digging F2. Tomorrow I will learn how to draw sections with Dawnell. So today we are going to plow. I will start by having my workers blast 20cm in L2007. This gives a nice step effect with L2008 being higher than L2009, which will be higher than L2007. If nothing else this should give a nice section,   After breakfast Michaelle loaned me Ercan for a while. During this time I was really able to plow. I had him and Samet picking and shovelling while Bayran ran the araba. Unfortunately Ercan was taken as quickly as he was given. The plowing has now slowed down considerably.   By the end of the day I was right back where I started. Apart from the oven L2002, the surface L2003, and some rocks in the northeast corner, my trench is very boring.        ,~: F-2-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2007,"124,2000-08-15," F-4-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4001,","   August 15, 2000   I told the workers to finish leveling L4002 another 5cm. Bradley/Andy came by and troweled around L4002 and found a surface near the North East baulk. We spent the morning trying to peel back the surface (because the dirt literally peeled off) and found a hard burnt clay forming a semi circle around a light grey colored hard packed surface. While peeling back we found chunks of wood ash under the clumps of soil, we took some carbon samples. We left that area for a bit so we could clean up and level the rest of the trench.   We then took down L4003. We know this material is probably mixed since its so close to the place where we dump dirt.    Next we cut down L4001 to see if the surface extended under it. The dirt was much like the dirt in L4002 which peeled off readily from the surface but was very hard and blocky.    When the rest of the trench was clean we went back to the NW corner. We peeled back more of the area to define the burnt clay area and the grey surface better. We found that the burnt clay was a brick wall about 8-9 cm thick surrounding the grey surface. The grey surface had some scattered pottery, lots of splintered bone, and some chunks of black ash. We troweled around the area finding that the grey surface was actually soft underneath.      ,~: F-4-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4001,"125,2000-08-15," D-1-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1/Locus 1005,","   Aug 15, 2000   Locus 1005Well, yesterday I had a fever and did not go out to the site. So, today, I'm not feeling that great but I did my best. Day before yesterday, I found a dark-bluish discoloration in the NW corner of the trench. Today, I tried to define what this is. I excavated arond and inside, but it seems to be just a variation in the soil. The soil seems to be burnt, since it had some small frag of charcoal within. It did not follow any definate shape. I found same soil arond it when I dug deeper. I thought it could be an oven, but the soil was not ashy. I found a flat-compacted mud below these discoloration. But, this too had not distinctive shape, and had many animal holes around them. Found no pottery, lithics, or bones around. Before I began excavting this area, I thought about giving a different Locus number, but I decided not to.    Now, we began bashing the rest of Locus 1005. We first excavated about 20 cm and see what was there, but it was taking longer than I thought, so I decided to knock the whole thing down at once. I lost 1 day, and the days that is left is short, so I must hurry up and level this trench.      ,~: D-1-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1/Locus 1005,"126,2000-08-15," F-1-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1010,","   August 15, 2000      We cut a section from the South in L1015 (the wall). Now we are trying to find the borders. So I decided to go 5cm to the wall in L1014 (N of L1015). Wee dug L1014 for 5-10cm and now I am planning to dig the wall to the same level and check the baulk section. We are now leveling L1015 with L1014 and we will spray to see the lines again. If there will be no lines I will close L1015.   I saw some lines at the southern edge of the locus. So L1015 is still open then I decided to go 10-15 cm more in L1012. We started from the South-Eastern corner but after that I had to go to the hospital so I closed my trench.     ,~: F-1-2000-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1010,"127,2000-08-16," F-2-2000-08-16-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2,","F-2-2000   August 7, 2000   We opened up Area F today. After taking initial elevations I told the workers to dig 20 cms for L2000. Digging was slow at first because we only had two wheelbarrows for three trenches. In addition to that I only had two workers because some of them were commandeered to dig a cut into the east side of the tepe.   The soil at this level is topsoil fill. It is brownish gray in color. The terrain is maked by plow furrows.   We just found out that \60 Minutes\ is coming.   After digging down 20 cms I noticed that the soil seemed redder and softer. Because of this I closed L2000 and opened a new locus, L2001. As of yet there are no indications of anything special. Tomorrow I may split the trench in half and stagger it so I have a section to see what is going on.      8 August 2000   the plan for today is to take L2001 down 5-10cms. If nothing shows up I may split the trench into east and west halves. I could stagger these by 5cm to help me get an idea of what is going on in the trench.   About 5mins into digging we found an oven in the middle of the trench. After consulting Andy I decided to go ahead with my plan to divide the trench in half. I will push the west half down another 5cms. Hopefully this will geve me a good section and help me find a surface for the oven.   Change of plan. I turned my back to do elevations and they started digging the east half of the trench. Here we found some bones, rocks, and pottery that could be a surface. Because of this we will peel back the eastern part and try to articulate a surface. It looks like I'll have to change my loci making L2002 the oven and L2003 the surface.   My workers are quite slow and often stand around. I'm tired of babysitting. Fortunately Andy brought Meki over to help me. I'm having him articulate the surface, L2003 and he's also going to work on the oven. Meanwhile the other three workers will dig the rest of the trench down level with the southeastern corner of the trench.   By the end of the day L2001 has been levelled while L2003 has been somewhat articulated. The plan for tomorrow is to work more on the oven and the surface as well as pushing down the rest of the trench.      9 August 2000   I was ill and didn't dig today.      10 August 2000   Today I looked around the trench and noticed that the southern half was a different color than L2001 so I opened it up as a new locus, L2004. It is characterized by a grayish brown soil that is medium packed. In the northwest corner of the trench it appears that more of a surface is emerging. In that case I will expand L2003 so that it includes the entire surface of the northern part of the trench. I will have the workers push down L2004 by 5cms while I try to articulate L2003.   Stopped digging after breakfast to go get an IV.      12 August 2000   The plan for today is for me to continue peeling back L2003 while my workers trowel around close to the oven, L2002 in the hope of finding the its associated surface. if they don't find it I'll probably have them push down L2004 by another 5cm.   After consulting with Bradley w decided to get a photo after the surface is articulated. Then we will push down L2003 to the level of l2004.      13 August 2000   Today I will begin by taking elevations because some of my figures from yesterday don't make any sense. Then we will take out the surface, L2003. After that I will open a new locus L2005 below it and push it down level with L2004. Then, Inshallah, I will be able to take out the oven. We are screening all of the buckets that come from L2003.   After breakfast we continued to level L2005 to the same depth as L2004. After that we will take out the oven, keeping only a few pieces of it along with a soil sample from the area inside the oven. This fill is L2006.   By the end of the day L2005 was levelled to the same depth as L2004 and the oven has been taken out. Tomorrow I will scrape around to see if I've taken out the entire bottom of the oven and the fill inside it. I'll also poke around for any texture differences and color changes to give me an idea where I stand now that my oven and surface are out.      14 August 2000   The plan for today is to make sure the entire oven and the fill inside it are out and close both loci.   After poking around I noticed that the soil in the southern half of the trench was harder packed so I closed L2004 and opened up L2007 beneath it. I checked the oven, scraped around, and decided that I had found the bottom of it so I closed L2002 and L2006.   Now I'm having my workers take L2007 down by 15cm. I poked around the north half and noticed a new surface emerging in the northwest corner. I will therefore close L2005 and open up 2 loci beneath it- L2008, the new surface and L2009, the rest of the northern half.   After we pushed l2007down 15cm I didn't notice anything so i had them go down another 5cm. Meanwhile I scraped around L2008 and found that it extended farther than i originally thought.      15 August 2000   The plan for today is to articulate the surface L2008. i will also trowel around L2009 and L2007 to see what is going on in those loci. I'll probably have the workers take down L2009, possibly 5-10cm.   I looked around and decided to have the workers go 10cm down on L2009. I'm beginning to wonder if L2008 is a new surface or just a continuation of L2003. There were about 5cm of soil between them, but L2009 appears to follow the same plan as L2003. One difference is the composition. L2008 is made up of small rocks approximately 5*6cm. i don't see any of the cobblestones that characterized L2003.   After talking to Bradley we decided that today will be my last day digging F2. Tomorrow I will learn how to draw sections with Dawnell. So today we are going to plow. I will start by having my workers blast 20cm in L2007. This gives a nice step effect with L2008 being higher than L2009, which will be higher than L2007. If nothing else this should give a nice section,   After breakfast Michaelle loaned me Ercan for a while. During this time I was really able to plow. I had him and Samet picking and shovelling while Bayran ran the araba. Unfortunately Ercan was taken as quickly as he was given. The plowing has now slowed down considerably.   By the end of the day I was right back where I started. Apart from the oven L2002, the surface L2003, and some rocks in the northeast corner, my trench is very boring.      16 August 2000   I learned today that Dawnell wasn't ready to draw sections yet so instead of standing around we decided I would plow for another day. I started by having the workers push down L2007 by 20cm.   After consulting with Andy we decided that once L2007 had been pushed down 20cm we would take out the surface L2008. Then if we have time we'll take a corner out of L2007 and push it 5-19cm down.   After breakfast I trowelled around the southwestern corner of the trench. it appears that there could be mudbrick sluppage. I couldn't make out any definite lines so I had the workers continue to plow.    We sprayed the baulks and I think I can make out a brick outline in the southern part of the western baulk.   L2007 is finally done so for the rest of the day I will have my workers take out the surface L2008. I'm still not sure if L2008 is the same as L2003 or an earlier phase of it.         TRENCH SUMMARY OF AREA F, TRENCH 2   17 August 2000      We opened up F2 on 7 August 2000. F2 is the northernmost trench on the lower lip of Kenan Tepe near the Tigris. The terrain of this area is marked by numerous plow furrows. L2000 was the topsoil layer which went down for about 20cms. Below this depth the soil became both redder in color and softer in texture. This led me to close L2000 and open up a new locus, L2001.   While taking down L2001, about 30cms from the top of the trench we found the beginnings of an oven in the center right of the trench. We opened this as L2002. The fill inside the oven later became L2006. We didn't want to disturb the oven so we left a 10cm buffer zone and began pushing down around it. This led to the discovery of a surface, L2003, in the northeastern quadrant of the trench. We peeled back and realized that the surface extended across the northern 2/5 of the trench. L2003 is composed of small cobblestones approximately 5*8cms on average with scattered pottery and even some animal bones. We believe that the surface is contemporary with the oven, as they are at the same depth. We are not sure of the period, I haven't had any pottery readings yet, but we suspect it is Islamic. From this area we did recover a nice pot base and two handles from a dish, both KT# 2017. These should be good diagnostics for helping us determine for certain the time period of these loci.   Meanwhile, in the southern half of the trench the soil became grayer and more packed. For these reasons I opened up L2004 as a new locus. We pushed this down in the hope of finding a surface, but to no avail.   After L2003 had been articulated, we took it out, screening every bucket that came out. Below it we opened up a new locus L2005 and pushed it down level with L2004. Then we took out the L2006, the fill inside the oven and took a soil sample, KT# 2023. Inside this fill was an interesting piece of pottery. This piece, within KT# 2021 is a crappy looking sherd that Bradley says could be either Chalcolithic or Islamic. We only saved a few pieces of the oven as KT#2022.   On 14 August 2000 I trowelled around and noticed that the southern part of the trench was becoming harder. This led me to close L2004 and open up L2007 beneath it.    In the northern part of the trench a new surface began to emerge. I therefore closed L2005 and opened up L2008. After a while I began to wonder if L2008 was a new surface or just a continuation of L2003. It follows the same plan in the trench, but it was not composed of cobblestones, but rather small rocks about 5*6cms on average. All of this leads me to believe that L2008 is an earlier phase of surface L2003.   The rest of the northern half of the trench was opened as a separate locus L2009. L2009 is composed of a hard packed brownish gray soil.   On 15 August 2000 I learned that I would close up F2 soon so I could go and learn how to draw baulk sections. That being the case I was given the go ahead to plow. So we took down L2007 by 20cms. This gives a nice step effect with L2008 being higher than L2009, which is higher than L2007. The next day we started out by plowing L2007 by another 20cms. Here we came upon some interesting pottery, KT# 2039. There were two sherds, on a rim, that were ridged. One even looks like the veins of a leaf. I am hoping, Inshallah, that it is from the Chalcolithic. At this juncture it looks as if we're starting to come upon some mud brick sluppage, eroded mud brick wash. I trowelled around, but couldn't see any definite lines so I allowed my workers to continue plowing. After 20cms had been dug we sprayed the southern half of the western baulk. I think I can see the outline of one brick.   The last order of business with trench F2 was to take out the surface, L2008. This brought it about level with L2009. F2 was closed at the end of 16 August 2000.     ,~dc-terms:title: F-2-2000-08-16-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2,"128,2000-08-16," D-1-2000-08-016-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1/Locus 1005,","   Aug 16, 2000   Today, I slept in for a while in Bismil and came after the breakfast. Workers were bashing before I arrived. I was feeling better, but not in a perfect state; I had approximately 76.38021 % of my average strength today. I was drawing a section of the D3 and did not concentrate on what was going on at the trench 1. I hope they were doing a good job. There are still some soil left to dig tommorow. We will finish this trench. Level the whole trench, stright the balk and I'm out of here!         TRENCH SUMMARY OF AREA D TRENCH 1 (before pottery reading)      The purpose of this trench was to reach the early occupational level of the site since the area D was located at the lower part of the site. During a survey, we found some pot-sherds from early period (Chalcolithic, Uruk, etc). Area D is located at the east side of the Tepe below a steep hill where there is relatively flat area like a hump that sticks out from the Tepe. We did not achieved our purpose in this season. Because of the deep disturbed top and sub-top soil, it took us a week to excavte to reach the possible cultural level, and we began excavte this area during a last week. We have not looked at the pottery in detail, so I am not certain about the age of the Loci that I excavated. Although I am not a pottery expert by any sense, most of the pottery appears to be from the Hellenistic period. Lower levels seems to be earlier. We must wait for the pottery reading. However, this area still looks promising for next season. Trench 3, which is located 1 m West (1 m uphill) of Trench 1 had multiple layer of surfaces and possible Hellenistic wall, or a path. When I walked around this area, especially below the area D, I found several fragments of early pottery, even possible Ubaid rim-sherd, many lithics, such as obsidian. Also, from this trench, and Trench 2, which is just North of this trench, seems to produce more lithics and grind-stone than other areas. Since we finish excavting the disturbed zone, if we given several days to excavte, there is a great possibility that we could achieve our original purpose of this Area.    LOCUS 1000 (E 85.34-85.22 W 86.76-86.05)   This Locus is the top-soil and heavily disturbed. Because of the steep slope, I expected to have a deep top and sub-topsoil. Interesting enough, I found many worked stone artifacts, such as stone-bowl, possible weight (circular shape with a hole in the center), and others; for more info look at the KT 1003,1005, 1007, 1008, 1010, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1017, 1018, 1019, 1022, 1024). First I thought this could be the indication of the early occupation of this area. Near the North balk, about 1 m from the west balk, I found a concentration of the pottery. It appears to be a pot-smash, but it is too close to the present surface (KT 1011). I found a hard compacted layer of the soil below this potsmash, and gave a new Locus 1001. Because of the slope, I decide to assigne locus 1001 for only west side of the trench. We did not excavte much in the east side; as I mentioned above, West side had a compacted soil, but East half was still in top-soil. I divided the trench in half, and made a arbitrary steps at the 2 m line.   Locus 1001 (West 1/2 86.05-85.86)    The purpose of this Locus was to level the entire trench flat, unless we reach a possible cultural layer. There was a possible stone piled wall (86.13) at the SW corner of the trench, and found 2 possible pit, so I closed the Locus and gave Locus 1002. We found several large rocks around this possible wall; probably fallen from the wall. The soil arond the wall seemed somewhat compacted, but did not seems to be much of anything. The wall was made of piling up the flat and round rocks for about 30 cm in height. In this locus, above and below, I found sevral brick fragments, those could be Hellenistic in age.    Locus 1002 (West 1/2 85.86-85.63)   Since we found 2 possible pit, and soil was more compacted than locus 1001. First I thought that this could be a cultural surface. The stone lined wall finished in this Locus. Also, we found a pile of rocks in the North balk. A possible pit were located on the South-centarl section of the trench, irregular shape of about 1.75 m in length and 1 m + wide. the another pit was smaller, and it was located on the west balk, on the north side, about 1.25 m in length. I excavted both pits, and found relatively few pot-sherds, bricks, lithics, and bones. (chech KT 1033, 1034, 1035, and 1036). These pits seemed to be just a variation in the soil. The shape of the pit was irregular, and did not have uniform depth. I decided to make the whole trench flat. The pile of rocks that I found near the North balk was constructed by flat-rocks, and found a possible equid teeth. (KT 1055 and KT 1056). In general soil seemed to be somewhat vary in nature and disturbed, it could be still in the sub-top soil, especilly in the Eastern side of this Locus.   Locus 1003 (85.63 - 85.20)   This is the first time that I had a flat trench! Strange enough, there is less worked stone in lower levels. I found a pile of rocks about 1 m away from the SW corner of the trench. However, this did not look like constructed by human. Soil was same as inside and around the rocks. Some rocks were layed flat but many rocks were on side. I excavated for about 30 cm, and found a line between loose and compacted. This line roughly followed the 1.5 m line from East balk. Loose soil to the East is probably still in the top-soil but the west side could be in cultural level. I decided to excavted the loose soil (Locus 1004) first and than compacted soil (Locus 1005).    Locus 1004 (85.20 - 84.75)   This Locus is the East side of the line which is loose soil. I thought that the Compacted soil will gradually slopes down, but it more or less went down straight. One area at the center had a slope of compacted soil. About 30 - 40 cm below, we found a compacted soil, which is similar to the soil west -side. I think at this point, it is below the top-soil. There were some pottery and lithics. Found obsidian fagments and several pieces of bricks from this Locus.    Locus 1005 (85.20 - 84.84)   This Locus is the west side of the trench with the hard compacted soil. This Locus started out with a promise of discovery, but turned out to be little disappointment. In Northwest corner of the trench, I found a hard-compacted soil that looked as a mud-brick. We tried to make the soil flat and see if there is a mud-brick or not. There were few several lines, but were not stright and the soil looked disturbed. In the same area, I found a band of dark soil that seemed to be in circular shape. First I thought it could be an oven; the size and shape of the dark soil was similar to that of A1 Locus 1018. This dark soil contained chrcoal. I excavated and tried to define the shape. When I start excavating, it turned out that the shae was irregular and had more dark-soil below. I decided to bash this area and make the trench flat. So that next year, when someone comes back, they will have a flat trench. Found grind-stone and Obsidian from this Locus.      For this season, the Area D trench 1 resulted in some disappointment, but for next year, there is a great chance of discovery of this Trench. From this season, we basically removed the thick top-soil that was washed down from the steep slope. For next year, we should reach the earlier ocuupational levels. We found many grind-stones, lithics, and Obsidian. All pottery seems to be from Hellenistic age, but still wait to be seen.         ,~: D-1-2000-08-016-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1/Locus 1005,"129,2000-08-16," F-1-2000-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1010,","   August 16,2000      We are digging 1012. We started that yeaterday but we couldn't finish that. This soil is hard and workers had hard time with this soil and the color is brownish gray.   We are almost at the elevation of the L1010.Now we are sweaping so I will see if there is anything different.   We removed the rok in L1010 and the lowest is 47.77 and the rock is 45cm*50cm diagonally. Now here is a hole in L1010 because of the rock. It was almost standing.   I removed the other 3 rocks that were forming a circle at the end of the wall L1015. We sprayed the ground in the North half of the trench. Because I thought that there were some lines. But I cannot see them anymore. Now one of the workers is cutting the baulk.    We found a bone at the lower part of the Southern baulk. Over L1010I will put this into a bag.    Now I am planning to dig 5 more cm at the Northern half of the trnch. At that point I will change the locus. Because the burned mud-brick seems to end at that elevation.   We couldn't find the end of the mud-brick so I decided to level the northern part of the trench with L1012. Then I will change the locus.    We closed the loci 1012, 1015, 1014 and opened 1016 which is the dirt under everything. The color seems like light brownish gray.   I dont want to remove the burial today so the loci around the burial 1011 is still there L1013 and a small part of the 1012.     ,~: F-1-2000-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1010,"130,2000-08-16," C-1-2000-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1033,","   August 16, 2000      We start by taking out the section hump from L1037. The blue pebbles were over the L1043 cobbles but under the big L1039 stones. As we peel back L1037 section hump, there is a lot of that dark ashy silt underneath.   There was a pit in the middle of L1048, 0.5 from SB, 0.8m from EB, with a 0.22 diameter and 0.12 depth. I took some soil from it and a lot of worn pot sherds. This we will call the South pit as it is in the South part of this locus.   In L1047 in the Northwest is another similar pit I will call North pit. We dug it. 1.15m from SB, 1.1 from EB is its center. It has 0.24m diameter and 0.12m deep.   Then we dug L1051 ash pit out. Also we begun to level North from L1047 to find extent of bricks. First we dug North towards L1051/L1050. Then we dug westward towards the corner of L1043.   We also took a soil sample from L1051, the ashy pit. As we scrap, the pit became long in a North-south direction. There is less crumbly dirt on the same sides, I am trying to find the full extent. All the dirt in this area tends to have dark silty dirt.   After drawing the baulk we dug the North part of the probe in L1045 up to the North baulk. Then we also cut straight west from L1045 through the bricks of L1046 up to the West baulk.        ,~: C-1-2000-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1033,"131,2000-08-16," B-2-2000-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2/Locus 2029,","   August 16, 2000      Will take the plan shot before taking down L-2030/ Articulating rocks in L-2038 and L-2039 then we'll sweep and shoot.

We measured our 5x5 on the side of the hill. There are only a few prickly weeds were in this section. The work men are digging them out. I am working with Lokman and Ercan. We are removing some top soil. We started at the southeast corner to remove topsoil. Then we hit upon some hard packed soil only about 8cm below the surface. It is flat and follows the plane of the slope. We only had to dig about 2cm on the downhill side. It is more of a crumbly dried mud surface. They are sweeping it. On the southeast corner we seem to have dug into it without initial problem. There are trees growing out of it, roots. This second surface is locus 1001, the topsoil is 1000.   After Carpus for breakfast, we started to dig the southeast corner of 1001. The dry crumbly dirt came apart pretty easy. We dug a quarter of the trench and looked for finds. We found a piece of basalt bowl, kt 1006 in this southeast quarter. And there were some interesting pottery rims.   Once we broke the top of 1001, the top pieces were held together tight so we had to break them up to search for sherds. But under there was more dirt until another solidish surface. We will clear to there to determine if it is a new locus. We got through some of the dirt to another crumbly white surface. In the southeast corner were some small smashed pieces of pottery. We found a snail shell and a funny rock shaped like a nail. We will probably crush through this level.   Tomorrow, I think we should continue digging the corner so we can find a section on the other parts of the trench.      July 22, 2000      We did Munsell on yesterday's loci. We are continuing for 10 cm in the quarter that we dug yesterday in the Southeast and we couldn't find too much pottery, only one or two pieces but there are many in the southeast corner on the bulk. But it doesn't seem like anything different. Yesterday there were some pottery at the same spot also. We sound some sandstone at the southwestern corner of our quarter, so we are now cleaning up, probably it is a different layer. We munselled the sandstone piece and it is 2.5Y 5/2 Greyish brown with some black pieces in it.   I found an acorn in the middle of our 2x2 locus, 1001. We cleaned the southeast 2x2 and there are a lot of rocks in the southwest corner. This we will clean more closely. There was found during digging a very different sort of stone with silver and gold and black colored flakes in it. Then we retook our measurements from yesterday in order to use the new level. Then we started our workmen on the North side, we started with the Northeast corner and decided to cut all the way west from there. We called this all part of locus 1001. The East side is pretty much the same. The West side is hard to tell if it is the same because we cut it fast. The chunks of dried dirt are big. There are also some big rocks. We only went down about 5cm on the West and 8cm on the East. We will start to clear the Southwest corner. We are taking it a little slower to look at where the rock pile will lead us.   We think there is something different in the Southwest corner it is so loose and the color is different, we will probably open a new locus for this but until we clean and decide we will collect the pottery as a new KT#1020 in the same locus 1001. It is probably a pit. And there are some rocks around it. We will leave them because they may be related with our rock feature that we couldn't describe yet.   I am curious that we have seen about 6 roots, of large diameter, but there are no trees on this hill. All the roots were buried, perhaps sprouting those prickle bushes on the surface.   Now we have cleaned most of 1001 away to get to the similar 1002 in the North part of the trench. The action now is in the Southwest corner, where our rocks have expanded out almost circular. There seems to be a different sand texture inside the rock circle. We will measure the bottom of 1001.   We dug through the scattered rocks and they don't seem to continue, so we counted that as the same locus, 1001. That brought the trench near level and clean. Next we thought to work off another 10-15cm off the East, uphill side. We were working North to South when we found a large, fat group of broken pottery and some large bones, so we will clean. The pottery is in the middle. Then we worked from South to North. The soil close to the middle made a funny hollow sound when we hit it and it felt more damp, or soft, it is hard to tell. We left it to \dry\ for tomorrow and we will tell at that point. We should also clean up the broken pot and give it a KT number.      July 23, 2000      We have the pot smash in the middle of the East side and the rock garden in the middle of the South side. We started the day by dropping the area between the rock garden and the pot smash. And also taking out the crumbly topsoil on the North half. There are a few more pieces of pottery around the smash. There is a larger piece 1/4 of the way from the west on the North bulk. It is buried deep and has a wavy side. We found some bone on the North side.   We took a photo of the East smash. Then we sent our workmen working on leveling the West side of the trench. We want to end up with a flat surface on the downhill (West side) that we can clean. There continued to be large pieces of pottery strewn about our trench. We just found a large piece on the west side. We will create a step trench. The rock garden which Elvan is clearing appears to extend North. The funny thing is we find few rocks directly East. There are a lot of medium size rocks around the big rocks. To me that says the rocks were placed there on purpose.   The solid in the downhill (NW) side is beginning to be a little less packed. Some different coloration on the deepest part near the middle of the entire trench on the uphill side of our flat trench. On the North wall there are some large pieces of pottery we have kept in place. I will open 1003 on the rock garden because there are so many rocks around. Just West of the rock garden are a lot of small sherds and stones.   We started to go towards the middle and there were some more large sherds and some rocks, and we removed the big rock in the middle. We got a nice level surface down at the bottom. Then we started towards the rock garden. First we wanted to level from the Southwest corner along the wall to the rock garden. There were some nice rims so we opened KT 1029. We will go until I think it was a new locus (1003), the rock garden. Also we leveled the center to the higher step. The trench is on two level steps. In the southeast corner between the rock garden and the pottery smash is very long and has a nice complete rim, which may connect the two. It seems a nice pot and I want to dig it up.      July 24, 2000      We decided to level the NE corner with the Western half with a big pick. For this area we will use small hand picks because there might be some more pottery smash. These 2 areas will be collected as L1002 and with the KT 1031.   We decided to open a new locus for the SE corner because there might be something different between the pot smash and rock garden. If these two are related, the section between them should be a different locus.   Now the workers are removing the dirt in the NE corner and we found some white plaster in locus 1004. But it is not very clear. With all the pottery there, it is probably a surface. We found a piece of lithics there also. There is stone pottery sitting there also. But we think the soil is the same with the locus 1002. We found a pot sherd, thin fine fabric, probably late in this context.   In the NE corner we couldn't find any more pot smashes but the pottery pieces are bigger. In the SE corner we cut a little section and we saw the white material there. It doesn't look like a surface but there is a probability. We found a rock when we leveled the NE corner.   Okay there was nothing special on the North side, so we continued to dig from the North to the South in the middle adjacent to the smash and towards the rock garden. We have also started to dig in towards the rock garden.   As we work towards 1004 in the middle a lot of pottery started to appear about the same time as the white particles. It is very similar to those I found in the Southeast corner in 1004 before I stopped digging there. We will change this locus to be, in the middle of 1004 also.   We will make 1004 the Southeast corner until the white stuff in elevation, thus it will be everything on our pseudo surface. Then the white stuff, a potential surface will be a new locus. The sectioning of the rock garden has not turned anything up yet. We started to go to South from North we are trying to find the other edge of the white stuff.   After breakfast we started clearing the surface. I put this red rock that looked like the inside of a brick in its own kt in 1036. We had found a bigger piece but it was lost. We are also sweeping the floor.   We are now cutting through the rock garden from the West. But still there is nothing in the section. And we are trying to level the 1004. We are following the white plaster and trying to level it except the pottery smashes there. We decided everything on the white plaster will be collected in L1004. So if it is a surface here, it won't get mixed.   In the section that we are cutting through the rock garden, we saw some white pieces all distributed irregularly. We cut the rock garden! (Peter is very sad.) We will clean L1004 and we couldn't find any more pot smashes. So after cleaning this we will take a photo and continue digging. There are some reddish spots in the West side of the trench.   We found a C14 ash sample but we didn't take the sample yet. There is a piece of pottery (round) near to the C14 sample. We will also take an elevation but we cannot do that before taking the sample. (We don't have aluminum foil).   As the rock garden was being removed, I cried. We found one bone underneath. Long live the rock garden. This is a day of infamy.   The rock garden (L1003), and the smashes 1004 will be closed soon. The elevated Southeast corner will become 1005 on account of the white flakes. We will cut over towards the pots in order to have them come out easier.   We are now digging 1005. (Under white plaster pieces). Then we will level these. We started to find some reddish soil. So we will clean it up.   While digging Eastward under what used to be 1003, the rock garden, we saw a portion of reddish dirt. It is only distinguishable when scraped, but when brushed it looks the same as everything else. We canceled KT1044 because we decided to leave it there. We found some other pot sherds around that area.      July 25, 2000   We have only a rise in the Southeast corner- where we took the pot smashes from yesterday. That is L1005. There was a little reddish dirt when we scrapped on the top just west of the nice rimmed pot. We will flatten 1005 and clean the entire flat trench to look for some change. Where we cleared 1005 on the North side of the current rise (middle of the East side), we have some pot smashes all level, and level with the carbon sample. We removed the carbon sample from L1006, Kt1045. And it's elevation is 92.40. in the L1006 there are some pots, mortar, pestle and there are also some rocks in the western side of these. It may be a surface. We will call it Elvan's Kitchen. We will level the SE corner and we will check if there is pottery under that part. In the SE side we found some more pieces of the nice rimmed pot that we took out yesterday (KT1042,L1004). We saw a little white plaster but it doesn't look like a line. And we are digging the NW quarter of the trench (15-20cm).   We have started digging the Northwest corner again, we first dropped 10cm and then another 10. We need to level the whole West (downhill side) and then clean it.   We have almost brought the Southeast side down to level. That means 1005 will soon disappear.   The Northwest corner is 1007. The only thing we have removed so far is the carbon sample. We have found the nice bottom of the nice rimmed pot a little Southwest of the previous piece. We also found another piece Northeast of it. We continue to level the Southeast. Also we are continuing South on the West side to level it all the way across.   We found another piece of sandstone as we found in the rock garden in the SW side of the trench.   We continue, we have to take a lot of dirt out of the West side. There doesn't seem to be much, but there has been some more of those white flakes. Perhaps it is more of what we see in 1005. We are now sweeping the East side of the trench. With that white material, and pot smash and some rocks. We need a photo!      July 26, 2000   We are cutting the section in the middle of the trench and we are looking for lines and we saw the white material in the North side of the trench for the first time. But as with the South Side, these white pieces are not forming a line which would indicate some sort of architecture.   We decided to dig the higher part of L1007 in the middle so we will have a section. And then we will remove the rest.   We found a piece of teeth in the section in the middle, it might be an animal bone buried there or related with the surface (Elvan's kitchen).   We cleaned the West surface and began a probe from there heading East to the middle of the nice-rimmed pot and Elvan's kitchen. Also, in the very Northwest corner, there are some bones and loose soil which we will open as L1008, a pit.   I removed a large piece of pottery about half way down the probe, 10cm below the surface of the kitchen.   In the probe we found some rocks at the level of the West side of the trench. They look like they are a circle. And some cobbles also.   We found some white chalk-like particles in the Northern side of the middle section. We opened a new locus 1008, we thought there was a pit but we couldn't find too much pottery or bones in it. It was obvious that it was loose.   We are now cutting 1007, from the probe to the South side. We will try to find the rest of Peter's pot. Before breakfast we thought there was some mud brick in the NW part but we couldn't see the edges. There were some lines but probably they were because of the roots.   We have a bunch of so-so stuff and it is hard to put it all together. The rock circle seems promising as the dirt in the wall above it is very pebbly. The kitchen even seems to form a circle. I found some ash in the Southwest corner, but we have no facilities to remove it.      July 28, 2000      I have opened a new locus on the Southwest corner where the ash sample is. We were unable to take a decent ash sample. We will take elevations again because there may be a mistake.   We are digging in L1009. It is a 1x1 m square and we are trying to find what is around the ash (that we couldn't take). We are digging L1007 from the South to the kitchen (in the center of the trench) and we are trying to find the rest of the rock circle at the bottom and we will check the section in the North to see if we can make anything of the reddish material with white chunks (L1010). Peter is going to take the nice-rimmed pot out. He is digging from the West to the pot along the South Baulk.   There are some rocks under the big rimmed pot and they are at the same level with the kitchen/surface. The rim that we found in L1007 doesn't fit to the big pot. So we won't put that with the big pot. It is thinner than the big pot.   The rocks that are at the same level with the kitchen/surface will be removed. I will give a different Kt# to the rim (1061).   We found some of the shiny crumbly rock that we found a part of yesterday. One part is in L1009 and one is in L1007 (bottom), at the same level with the other pieces of that shiny crumbly rock.   We found some more rocks in L1009 around the West edge of the circle formed by things in Elvan's kitchen. It is a big pile of rocks and broken pottery.   In the Southwest we have dropped L1009 by 5 cm and there are a lot of rocks and some shiny stuff along the West baulk in the Northwest corner of the square we dug. Nothing much on the East side of that L1009 square.   We have cut deeply L1006 towards the East baulk around the rocks. On the North of our cut into the kitchen with L1007 we have run across more L1010 red-white dirt, which is good and expected.   We have quite a beautiful thing going down in the Southeast. There is a straight line heading Northwest.   We found a different kind of dirt in the South side of the rock feature. And we removed the rock there (in the South of the rock feature). There are a lot of big white pieces there also. We are leaving the white part and removing the dirt around it.   We seem to have found brick on top of the wall, it is red with white flecks in the section and towards the center. We cut into the kitchen to come south into it.   Peter's Best Theory: He decided that all the rocks in the area decided to migrate to our trench because we are so excited about rocks. The dead rock garden told them about his love for rocks. And some of them decided to create a wall, a straight line, but some of them thought that we would like another rock garden, so they formed a more unordered set of stones.   We are now leveling the middle part of the trench to the elevation of the West part. There was a big white rock but then Andy stepped on it and now we are removing the pieces. It was in the South side of the wall, we Munselled it as Gley1 8/1 Light greenish gray.   We have flattened and removed 1007, there are more rocks on the other (West) side, possibly connected. The probe has shown the side of the rock pile. We have one mudbrick to the South of the probe above the wall. Also in the baulk we see mudbrick-redder.      July 29, 2000      First we decided upon all the loci for the day. We started articulating the rock pile L1014. Then we started to remove L1006, we first removed 5cm to level with the rocks in L1015. But we couldn't find anymore rocks. We are going down there. We cut at an angle parallel to the wall.   And we started digging in L1018. The soil seems to be the same as L1007 but there are 2 loci separating that from L1007 so we decided to separate it. We will go down 10 cm in L1009 and are articulating my wall. The rocks in L1015 and L1014 are not related, there is a part of hard soil between them. There might be mud bricks between the rock pile L1014 and the wall.   We will clean and articulate the wall for a photo. We never cleaned the wall but we did articulate the West part and we went a little deeper in the West half of L1009.   Also we leveled L1018 with L1014 to see lines. And we worked a little on the mud brick lines And we worked a little on the mud brick. \And Andy worked on our baulk and he kicked the rocks there. Now we have holes in our section.\ But Peter found a piece of his pot in the dirt. So we kept that! But we won't keep the other pieces. We were articulating the wall but it doesn't have an order and we found a piece of that shiny crumbly rock again.   We end the day with a lot of rocks exposed to no explanation. So today, in recap, we cleaned the rock pile L1014, we articulated it a lot, it doesn't seem to go much further. We leveled off the Northeast corner(L1010,L1018,L1014) to look for bricks since it seems to have different coloration and some hard surfaces.   We leveled what was left of L1006 North of the wall. We have only a piece of mudbrick leftover. We also began dropping the Southwest side around the rocks of L1012 and the South side L1009 which is South of the wall. It is very much just dirt and not hard outside the wall. We have found almost nothing in that area. There are a lot of rocks, broken pottery and possibly brick in the Southwest corner.   We are still anxious about taking out L1010, the red brick, until we can clean the surface and search for bricks. There is a nice base on top of the rock pile. There seems to be very little under the Southwest rocks except brickish material.      July 30, 2000   We started cleaning the trench for photos. Then we are planning to level L1009 then we will go deeper in L1013. We saw a line in L1009 (very clear) parallel to the wall (L1011) on the South side, which separates the reddish dirt from the gray. And now we are cleaning that area. And in L1012 we found more rocks. And we couldn't see the continuation of the red line so we are going 1 or 2cm more in that area. We saw a line in the North side of the trench. In the L1010 we saw a very clear line in the South-west direction.   Andy was nice enough not to kick over our piece of mud brick on our wall.   We dug L1009 down today about 15cm. We leveled it to the West side that we cut yesterday. In the Northeast corner is the red/gray separation, apparently a mud brick line to the South and parallel to the L1011 wall. We spent a lot of time trying to level L1009 but have not yet finished. In the Northeast corner of the trench I brought the East side of the rock pile (L1014), L1018, and L1010 to the same level and flat with my nice new big flat trowel. We sprayed it to look for lines, but the only line we found was in the middle North side which runs east-west.   In the Northwest we dropped L1013 right up to the baulk but not all the way across. We start to find some rocks including a crumbly colored one closer to L1012. We took a soil sample on L1010 to remove it and found harder soil beneath.      July 31, 2000   We have the kid leveling L1009 South of the wall, I gave him a general pottery bag Kt1100, and he found some bone Kt1097. It hasn't been cleaned so we don't see anything there yet, but we are looking for bricks.   In the Northwest corner we started cleaning away from the wall L1012 North through L1013 and we found a line extending Northeast from the other wall. It is a nice line of stones.   In L1009 we found a different sort of shell on the North edge near L1011 wall, it is Kt1104.   Then we decided to remove the rock pile L1014, we find a lot of broken pottery and small-medium rocks. We had to open kt1102 to remove the top stuff, and kt1101 to remove a nice base on top of the pile. We also opened kt1105 for the middle to hold the rest of the pottery but changed to a bucket because there was so much. Elvan found a small green rock in the pile.   There is hard stuff in L1010 above what looks to be the full extent of our new wall. We are leveling L1014. I also removed the pot smash in the corner of the walls in L1012, gave it kt1098.   What's interesting is that all the rocks are strewn about near the intersection of the two rock lines. Perhaps it is a collapse.   We are not sure about L1012, it might be an architectural feature or a fill. We cut through L1014, the rock pile, there was not much underneath. The sections we saw on the South and West sides we had cut before were as low as it went.   We cut down L1018 heading Northeast. The soil is chunky, with not too many pottery pieces. As we reached the baulk we hit more rocks. We also found a funny yellow rock in the middle. It is some sort of rock made of a bunch of little rocks. It didn't look like a brick.   In L1012 we now have rocks all over the West baulk in a semi-organized position. As usual there is pottery smashed in between the rocks and a really nice base.   In the middle of the West baulk, West of the main intersection we dug L1012 down a bit and the soil seems to have more small rocks. Also in L1018, there beings to be rocks of not much size, but not dirt. On the East baulk there may be more.   We cut through L1015, the rocks in the middle of the East baulk. We also leveled off L1018 in the corner. The most interesting thing was we found a huge rock in the middle of L1010, in the middle of the North baulk in line with the new wall. We will level everything to search for a connection.   L1010 is red with white specks. That was different than L1015 which was dry with brownish chunks. The difference was distinct. Now Drew made an interesting observation, he said L1010 seemed to look like Fertilizer. It definitely seemed to smell and feel a little like that. It was a bit soft and moist (relatively speaking).   There were also a lot of larger rocks within L1010. Possibly they are part of the wall, possibly thrown into the \pit\ as the base of our red L1010.      August 1, 2000      We start today by separating all the loci. Then we saw that the level surface between the wall of L1019 and L1011 seemed to be different along the lines of where L1014 was. On the North it was more dirt and soft reddish. On the South it seemed more blocky and crumbly like the topsoil. So North is L1020, South L1016. We will clear and level both. We will screen a bucket from each since here may be a surface associated with our walls. North is Kt1117 screen, south is kt1118 screen.   Elvan started to dig the Southeast corner of L1021 from L1009. She wants to articulate the corner which seems to be here at the intersection. She found a clam shell which I gave Kt1120. We haven't hit upon any more large rocks in the clearing of that surface.   We decided to level everything but we felt bad about our mud-brick so we decided to leave it there. Don't worry! We put a tag on it so it won't be mixed with anything: \Lovely mud-brick.\ We found one more white rock (we found one in the Southeast corner a few days ago) in L1016.   We don't have our mud-brick anymore and Peter is cutting L1017 from the West. Then we will clean the trench. We found some more rocks under L1017.   We found some reddish stuff that might be pieces of an oven and it might be related with the rimmed pot. And maybe related with all pot smashes there. I will put that piece in a Kt bag. We found another piece of obsidian. We usually find that on both sides of the wall L1011. The rocks that we found under L1017 might be near an oven because we found some reddish stuff with some possible ash. Also we found a beautiful cover of a pot there.   After clearing the surface of L1016 and L1020 we found nothing, so we will call it L1020 all across the Northeast corner between walls L1019 and L1011. Except in the center where we are digging down 10cm to find if there are anymore rocks, this we call L1022.   We are digging 1020 for 15cm. There is an interesting piece of pottery in the middle of the rocks that we found under L1017. It looks like the top of something with a little square piece to hold. And there may be 2 pit formations in the West side of the trench.      August 2, 2000   We start the day by drinking Õó_ay and Apple juice for me. After a rousing au coppola rendition of Beethoven's 9th Symphony we decided to dig in the dirt. Our kid went to Jakob's trench, knocked out everyone and stole a flat small pick. We expect retribution from Area B during the later part of the day. It is quite amusing to watch our kid dig very slowly with an oversized hand pick. Elvan, who is by nature very cruel, decided that a tired, sad, suicidal, crying trench mate Pete is preferable to the one who is happy, good-natured, and full of life. We can only figure that she would make a poor Psychiatrist.   Our trench was pillaged last night by some locals searching for gold. Actually, someone saw a young lady from Ankara digging late in our trench last night. Elvan is a poet, she said, \If you close the cooler it will stay cooler.\ In reference to our water.   We are digging L1020 in the Northeast corner. We will level to the wall L1011 for photographs. We found a pile of medium-small rocks close to L1011 on the West side of L1020, at the same level as some other rocks.   In the Northwest corner we dropped L1025 about 10cm. We took some pottery out of the baulk about 10cm up so Andy won't kick it out. I separately kt'd it as kt1125.   Notice we decided to separated the pits in what used to be L1013. The rocks there potentially outline some separate storage areas, so the West one is L1023, the East L1024 and everything outside is L1025.   We cleaned our trench, sent the kid to get a good whipping at Elle's trench, let Lokman chill, and took plan photos of the whole thing.      August 5, 2000      We separated the reddish stuff in the South of L1011 and the rocks perpendicular to the L1011 is L1027, on the east of L1027 is L1028. The rocks (L1030) probably fell fro L1011 but they are a separte locus now. We think the L1020 is more reddish now so we changed it as L1032. We sprayed the floor but couldn't see anything. And there is another circular formation in the NE corner (1/4 of a circle) with loose soil in it. This is L1031.   Now we are digging L1012. We are planning to level it. We will dig L1032 for 5cm then we will search for mud-brick. I kt'd a possible loom weight of stone from L1012 in kt1145. There was a red brick-like stone found near there with a possible flat surface on one side.   There are some more rocks under L1032 so there is no mud-brick there. Probably it was a surface with all pebbles. But we took a soil sample from the surface. The surface is the rocks we are uncovering.   In the Southwest corner we are searching hard to find the mud-brick from the spot we took L1012 off. In L1032 we found a bunch of rocks. As we try to level it to the rocks, the soil is more dirty and choppy, a bit more red. It will be hard to level because it is loose. We will take L1022 down 5cm to level it to L1009. There seems to be no more rocks under the line formed between L1011 and L1021.   We are now leveling L1032 and there are more rocks under it. We think the soil is more silt. North of L1011 next to the East baulk, we found some rocks, and the sand around the rocks are darker like ash. In this layer (L1032) there are a lot of pebbles. We are cleaning the trench.   There is reddish stuff in the West side of the rocks that we found today (In the North of the wall L1011). They look like bricks.   We dropped L1031 in the Northeast corner by 10cm. There are many pebbles in that area. The rocks stretching Southeast from L1026 are disconnected with the walls on the East baulk. We are sweeping L1024/L1023 clean for a photo. Also we will clean L1031 and L1026.      August 6, 2000      We are digging the pits L1023/L1024. And the soil in the pit L1024 is really hard although it is soft in L1023. We screened and took soil samples from both of them. Peter thinks that he sees a line in the baulk. \A mud-brick line\, he started dreaming about mud-brick (!) We found reddish stuff with white pieces under both pits (same material as in L1010). We found a square shaped rock and we put that into the lithics bag. Around the rocks in L1033, the soil is dark and silty. Probably it contians ash. It seems only to be on top of the flat square rocks.   We cleaned out some more of L1031 to level it with L1032. We are looking for a connection between L1026 and L1036. There are a lot of pebbles in the Northeast corner, but they don't seem to form a surface.   We dug L1032 East of L1034 between L1033 and L1036. We found a piece of pottery with ash on the inside and a burned surface. I also poked around in L1033 at the loose, dark silt.   Elvan started to articulate rocks in L1011 heading East. She took pottery off of the wall. There seems to be a straight line of rocks crossing from L1026 to L1036. L1031 is on the North side, L1032 on the South.   L1031 is turning up some very good lithics. We think it is a separate pit. L1026 seems to have a box and a possible flat surface for work. L1036 could be the same. I screened and took a soil sample from L1031 and screened L1032.   A lot of small pieces are coming up"134,2000-08-17," F-1-2000-08-17-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,","F-1-2000   August 7, 2000      I began by digging 10cm in L1000 which was top soil. That was too cautious it seems to be all top soil, so I told them to dig another 10cm.    At 20cm we came upon a lighter grey soil that was harder packed with finer grain. Most likely this is just sub top soil but I changed locus anyway to L1001. I dug another 20cm down finding some large and beautiful possibly Hellenistic pot sherds in the North East corner of the trench.    Andy came by to warn us that we were digging in a heavily plowed zone, which would account for the mixed soil and the presence of modern debris.    There are two large roots at the North Baulk and North East area.   After going 20cm down L1001 we saw some soil that was a darker reddish brown and was a finer grain. I changed locus again to L1002 and decided to go down another 20cm looking for more stuff.   Unfortunately when I made this decision I didn't realize that it was so late in the day, so I just had everyone clean up the trench. All the KT#1006-1008 have been canceled. While cleaning the workers found a very small piece of jewelry with some bluish/green paint on it. I labled it a small find.   We spent the rest of the day playing hackey sack waiting for the TV crew to leave.      August 8, 2000      We opened L1002 and found a lot of very soft soil at the south part of the trench because I had decided yesterday that the soil was a darker reddish brown color. I orginally asked them to dig about 10cm but the soft soil enabled them to go almost 25cm without obstruction. I thought I might have a pit so I told them to leave the harder parts of soil for me to inspect. The soft soil might be due to the large roots in the area or because we're probably still in the plow zone. We found a few large pot sherds and a handle.    I'm also watching F4, the sounding on the south part of the slope, but there doesn't seem to be anything going on there.    The workmen are constantly complaining and they think I'm crazy because I told them to dig 25 cm in the whole trench. Those harder spots of soil I inspected ended up being the same as the rest of the trench which indicated that we didn't have a pit.    It took all morning to move all the dirt from L1002 but towards the end we came upon a concentration of bone at the NE corner of the trench. Andy said that most of the bones were broken in antiquity or plowed thru because they are so close to the surface. Before we found the bones imbeded in the soil we bagged the bones that we had disturbed in KT 1012. I also decided to sift 2 buckets to catch the smaller bits of bone, but we found only a potsherd and a few scraps of bone. We changed locus to L1004. I troweled around looking for a pit as Andy instructed. I doubt there is a pit in L1004 because all the soil felt the same as I was scraping. Andy thinks the bones are human but he's not sure. I spent the rest of my time articulating the bones.    While I was working on the disturbed burial, the workmen finished cleaning L1002 and began to push down 5cm in the new Locus L1003. I changed locus because I saw that the soil had gone from a dark reddish brown to a light reddish grey. The workmen uncovered a cobble and pebble surface about 5-7cm down which is very similar to the cobble surface in the sounding F4 just south of my trench and at about the same level as my surface accounting for the heavy slope at that side of the plateau. There are also flecks of white plaster/limestone flecks strewn throughout the surface. I also found some at the base of L1004. These flecks can also be seen in a section of F4 directly above the cobble surface. The workman were able to clean a the rock surface about 3m long and 1.25m wide. This does not appear to be the extent of the surface and we plan on finding the rest tomorrow.    At the very last minute Drew took a photo of the burial in L1004 and Andy grabbed the bones and bagged them. I guess L1004 is closed now.      August 9, 2000      First thing I did today was sift the last bucket from L1004 from yesterday. It was more like a 1/2 bucket and I was able to get a few scraps of bone out of it. I closed that locus yesterday but didn't have time to sift that last bucket.    The workers are now trying to level the trench on top of the rock/pebble surface which appears to be concentrated in the centre of the trench heading East to West. On the south side of the surface we are finding a very hard clay-like surface which may indicate a floor. We cleaned and measured the newly leveled surface then took a photo. We changed to the following locus numbers: L1005 is the fill North of the rock surface, L1006 is the rock surface, L1007 is the fill south of the rock surface. We began by digging a small sounding about 1/2 meter long at the western end of L1005.   Of course, while cleaning L1006 for phots we found yet another burial. It is lodged in the eastern baulk on top of the rock surface of L1006. There is a definite pit around the skeleton and the skull appears to be crushed. We have uncovered a lot of upper torso such as the ribs, skull, teeth, and arms. We articulated it as best we could then photographed it. Hopefully we'll box it tomorrow.    Meanwhile the sounding in L1005 was being dug about 5cm deep. We were trying to find the next layers of the rock surface in L1006 there appear to be few stones continuing, but that might just be tumble.    We also began digging in L1007 to see what was on the otherside of the rock surface where we found a very hard clay-like surface that felt suspiciously like mudbrick. The soil close to the baulk was a darker grey while the soil away from it was the same as the rest only it was harder packed and had orange and black spots indicating burnt clay. Bradley decided it wasn't a mudbrick and we chopped through it.   Last we screened all the dirt from L1008 and cleaned up.      August 10, 2000      I checked my measurements for L1006 this morning, they seem to be fine. We only have 2 workmen today so I've set them both to digging in L1005 and L1007. I'm still trying to see what is under the rock surface by coming down another 5-10cm along either side of it. The burial in L1008 will stay as it is for now, hopefully Andy will help me take it up today. I want to cut a section out of rock surface today.   I spent the morning articulating the burial in L1008. We took up some bones and took some photos. About 10cm below the rock surface L1005 we came upon another rock surface. This surface is devoid of pottery/bone/cultural debris indicating that it might not have been made by humans. The pebbles and cobbles are smaller in size than the surface in L1006.    We cleaned and photographed the surface in L1005. We are now chopping a section in L1006 at its western end along the baulk to see if their new rock surface continues under the 1st rock surface.   L1008: The Burial   We found a small bone near the skull that was in the position a clavicle should be in but it is actually a broken ulna for a very young person. The rest look like they belong to one person but that particular bone screws things up. There are more bones still in the baulk.       August 12, 2000      I (Elvan) started to run this trench and we found a pit in the SE corner L1010 under L1007 or may it may cut L1007. We are continuning in L1007, we tried to find some rocks from L1009. But it doesn't seem to continue so we are continuing as L1007 in the southern part of the trench. The trench seems to be cut by something at the Southern part. And before I started writing, they took off L1006, the bigger rocks. There weren't many left when I came. Only in the Eastern part of the trench in the middle.   In the West corner of L1007, there is a harder part but I didn't change the locus, I will check it after digging 10cm more. Next to L1010 on the West there is a big rock between the pit and L1007 (actually in the pit L1010, Because the loose soil continiues around the rock.). We screened one bucket from the pit. There are some bones under the hard material in the Southwest corner. There was always hard material here, in this corner. I remember that they were talking about finding amud-brick in this area but theree were no lines and there aren't lines now so it might be mud-brick debris or a mud brick wash.    We found a skull in the Southern quarter of the trench next to the Westen baulk but when we were digging we broke it. Now we are waiting for Andy and screening.   Kt1053 of L1007 is the part from the possible burial but we didn't change locus yet so it will be part of L1007. After we found the burial we took 3 buckets of dirt but it is mixed with the soil from L1007. The burial will be L1011.   We are now cutting the baulk and we will clean it after taking elevations and some measurements. We will take a photo and we will remove the possible burial good.      August 13, 2000      We started articulating the burial. And we started to remove the rocks in L1009 from the East side. Yesterday when we were leaving, we found a pot in the Southwest corner. It is probably related to the burial. And we found a spindle whorl, kt1056. This might be a burial good. It is located at the East of the burial near to the feet.   We are collecting the small bones together in kt1057 and we are saving all the soil in buckets. We will screen them and then I will take a soil sample from the screened soil.   We are still articulating the bones L1011. We couldn't find the feet and the legs are broken. There might be more than one person.   We are trying to remove all of L1009 and the soil South of the burial might be another locus but I didn't decide yet.   Under L1009 there are some reddish parts, but to identify them, we have to sweep the trench and we don't have enough time today. I decided to change the locus to L1012, but we didn't dig anything in this locus.      August 14, 2000      I think all the stuff under L1009 and a part of L1007 are made of the same material. That will be L1012. The soil at the Southwest corner will be L1013. The pit is still there (L1010) and the burial L1011. We started by sweeping the trench. In L1012, there is a loose part (might be a pit) near the rocks in the middle. It is only 2cm and doesn't look like a pit. I didn't open a locus for this.   And in the Northeast part of the trench there is an ashy part with clay (reddish soil) L1014. I started digging there to find out the borders and they found some kind of oven brick. L1014 material is packed, ashy with clay. Its color is reddish with gray and black.   But there is the ashy part so L1012 is the soil except that area (under L1009 and some part of l007). Now we are digging L1012 which is loose, medium sand mixed with silt. We will level L1012 and we will try to find the continuation of L1014. I screened all the soil from L1014 (ratio 1:1).   There are some bricks in the South of L1014. They seem to not be in the locus, though there is a chance they might be. We hit them when we were digging from the South side of the trench. For now they are part of L1012.   There might be a wall in the Northern side of the trench near the South of L1014. So we are now scraping and sweepping. That is something certainly different and I will call it as a wall. The wall will be L1015. We didn't mix the bags at the South and North of the wall because we started digging from the South of L1012 and we were aware of the color difference in the North of the trench. So I will keep the loci as it is now. I won't change them.   So the North side of the trench (according to the wall) will be L1014 and the South side will be L1012. But the pit (L1010), the burial (L1011) and the soil at the South part of the burial (L1013) are still there.   And the rocks in the middle of the trench seem to form a circle but they are now floating. So I don't think to give them a new locus number. But this is the part that I started as a pit. So I made a mistake. But there wasn't any pieces of pottery, bone or lithics at that area. For tomorrow we are planning to cut a section in L1015 to identify the bricks. And we are planning to work on the burial.      August 15, 2000      We cut a section from the South in L1015 (the wall). Now we are trying to find the borders. So I decided to go 5cm to the wall in L1014 (N of L1015). Wee dug L1014 for 5-10cm and now I am planning to dig the wall to the same level and check the baulk section. We are now leveling L1015 with L1014 and we will spray to see the lines again. If there will be no lines I will close L1015.   I saw some lines at the southern edge of the locus. So L1015 is still open then I decided to go 10-15 cm more in L1012. We started from the South-Eastern corner but after that I had to go to the hospital so I closed my trench.      August 16,2000      We are digging 1012. We started that yeaterday but we couldn't finish that. This soil is hard and workers had hard time with this soil and the color is brownish gray.   We are almost at the elevation of the L1010.Now we are sweaping so I will see if there is anything different.   We removed the rok in L1010 and the lowest is 47.77 and the rock is 45cm*50cm diagonally. Now here is a hole in L1010 because of the rock. It was almost standing.   I removed the other 3 rocks that were forming a circle at the end of the wall L1015. We sprayed the ground in the North half of the trench. Because I thought that there were some lines. But I cannot see them anymore. Now one of the workers is cutting the baulk.    We found a bone at the lower part of the Southern baulk. Over L1010I will put this into a bag.    Now I am planning to dig 5 more cm at the Northern half of the trnch. At that point I will change the locus. Because the burned mud-brick seems to end at that elevation.   We couldn't find the end of the mud-brick so I decided to level the northern part of the trench with L1012. Then I will change the locus.    We closed the loci 1012, 1015, 1014 and opened 1016 which is the dirt under everything. The color seems like light brownish gray.   I dont want to remove the burial today so the loci around the burial 1011 is still there L1013 and a small part of the 1012.      August 17,2000      I decided to level the rest of the trench to the bottom level of the pit 1010. ( I was planning to level L1016 with L1010 and leave the burial L1011 and the soil around the burial L1013)   We started digging from the South -Eastern corner next to the pit 1010 and we broke a skull at that area. So there is a burial under the pit and the skull was under the rock.   So we searched for other bones at the northern side of the skull but we couldn't find any. According to the bones (we found the piece of the forehead)Andy thinks that is a child. We are now screening the soil from that area and I will put the pieces from the screening to the same bone bag. It is interesting that thay placed the skull under that huge rock.    So the burial will have the locus #1017. Probably we cannot find the borders of the burial because it is the last day, so I will seperate an area for this locus arbitrarily. I will use the borders of the pit L1010 because I think that the pit and the burial are related.    After that we decided that we won't destroy any more bones at the northern side of the trench so we started digging through that direction (1016). We leveled the trench ( L1016) and cut the baulks and took the closing elevations. But may be we will go and take the bones from the burial 1011 this week if we can find enough time.

We also removed the pedestalled oven fragments in L2031 AS Locus-2031 because there are only a few small broken up bits and we think that the oven bits ended u where they are as a result of eroded occupational debris. We wanted to pick up these fragments today since today is the ast day of excavation and we did not want them to get lost after closing down the trench for the season. We also cleaned up the pedestal in L2031 at the norht edge where the bast wheel and fragments KT 2283-2284 once rested. (we had not cleaned that up yet.)      We finished removing L2036-west section and the alternate-colored bands of mudbrick visible in the west baulk corresponding with L2034 ALSO CONTINUE up to the edge (south edge) of L2036. Underneath L2036 west the plaster line (facing the new mudbrick wall L2042) continues to the west, although the bricks themselves of L2042 are not as clear in the west as they are in the east.      We also removed the short step of L2037 such that the area containing L2038-L2037-L2039 is now a flat step. the same brick somposition of L2037 is still visible in the \floor \ now that the wall has been flattened.       We cleaned up for section drawing and will start after the day-off's adventures in Diyarbakir land.          TRENCH SUMMARY A-2      Trench A-2 was designated as a step trench and begun as a 2m x 2m square on the sharply sloping north-eastern edge of the upper Tel. The trench was laid in according to the natural slope of the hill, rather than according to cardinal directions, therefore the trench descends the hill in a north-northeasterly direction rather than due north. The trench was dug to the final dimensions of 2m x 13m. The goal is to reach the bottom (valley) of the Tel within one or two more dig-seasons. Trench A-2 utilized three datums during this field season: primarily Datum 1, but also Datum 2 and Datum A, the latter of which was laid specifically to aid elevations for A-2 due to the steep incline of the Tel on the north side.      We broke ground in trench A-2 as a 2m x 2m square beginning with the topsoil layer L2000. As we dug successive 2m sections of the trench downhill from the original 2m x 2m, we continued using L2000 to describe topsoil. Thus L2000 covers an area of 2m x 13m. This locus, L2000, was consistently sunbaked and loose, sometimes full of root activity and animal burrows, and sometimes contained small to medium sized rocks floating in the dirt layer. Below L2000 we opened L2002 as subtopsoil and cleared the 2m x 2m trench in halves: eastern and western. Again in the same way as L2000, when we excavated further downhill in successive 2m sections, we referred to the subtopsoil as L2002 (with two exceptions [L2005 and L2035] which will be explained below).       Because the most interesting features were uncovered in the southern section of the trench between the south baulk and the 5m peg, I will focus this summary on our findings in this 2m x 5m area only. The remaining part of the trench between the 5m and 13m pegs produced only two interesting finds: a whole 11cm diam. possibly Hellenistic (?) bowl with mildly damaged rim recovered from L2002 as KT2267 at the 11m peg, and an entire basalt doorpost/wheel-like object with a hole carved in the center discovered as part of of L2031 bagged as KT2283 at the 6m peg. The rest of the area between the 5m and 13m pegs was uninteresting topsoil and subtopsoil. We are, however, beginning to see mudbrick lines exposed in section at the northern cuts. These areas of mudbrick will be examined and excavated next season.      Once the loose, sunbaked topsoil was removed from the 2m x 2m trench, we uncovered an area of large stones and oven debris in the southwest corner of the trench, which we documented as L2001 and removed. After changing locus to subtopsoil L2002 in the southern 2m x 2m area, we dug down and reached a burn layer in the eastern half of L2002 in the southern 2m x 2m area. We halted excavation in the eastern side and having examined the section cut in the western half, we changed locus in the western half to L2003 to compensate for the harder mudbrick debris we had whacked through in the eastern half of the 2m x 2m trench.       Having leveled the southern area of the trench as L2002 on the eastern side and L2003 on the western side, we changed Locus to L2004 because we had removed the layer of harder mudbrick debris we had seen in section and believed we were about to move into potential occupational debris. We pushed down the western half of the southern-most 1m of the trench as L2004. Then we pushed down the eastern half of the southernmost 1m x 2m area as L2004. We expanded L2004 to include the area 2m wide x 150cm from the south baulk. After pushing down this 150cm x 2m section of mudbrick and possible occupational debris in the southern most part of the trench as L2004, we hit the top of a mudbrick wall in the SE corner measuring 66cm x 92cm.       We assigned Locus 2006 to this wall in the SE corner, but did not begin digging it as that locus until several days later. The area in the SW corner of the trench lay directly adjacent to the wall and appeared to contain several animal bones and pot sherds which we hoped would help date the wall. Thus we assigned L2007 to this 65cm x 110cm area in order to retain tight control over the material recovered. Now that all the pottery from L2007 has been read, we recovered Type 9, Type 8, Type 4, and Type 5 sherds, which we believed at the time to be Hellenistic but now are re-thinking the identity of some of the type profiles. A sherd with a funky double ripple band remains stuck in the baulk corresponding to L2007.      Immediately to the north of the wall L2006 and collapse area L2007 lay a band of cobblestones covered by loose soil. We assigned L2008 to the soil in this area and pressed down several cm in the west section to expose the cobblestones, then dug down in the eastern half to expose the cobblestones there. After having removed the soil of L2007, which was filled with animal bones and occupational debris, we discovered that the cobblestones on the north side of L2006 also continue underneath L2007 in the SW corner of the trench. Thus we assigned L2009 to the entire L-shaped band of cobblestones. When we began removing this cobblestone surface, we discovered that it was constructed of 3 layers of cobbles which abut L2006 on the north and west sides of that wall. and also uncovered the top of another mudbrick wall in the SW corner, to which we assigned L2020. Having removed the cobblestones of L2009, we hit a layer of loosely packed soil, which we removed as L2018, and found underneath this soil layer another layer of cobblestones. We assigned L2019 to these new cobblestones, which appeared to serve as the foundation for L2006 because they were tucked underneath the edge of what appeared to be the last course of bricks in L2006. We excavated L2019 and below that layer of cobblestones we hit a layer of very hard packed mudbrick material to which we assigned L2021, changing to L2022 after several cm because we believed we had missed an important transition in the soil. Having reached the bottom of L2022, we could see clearly that the cobblestones of L2019 continue underneath L2020 as well as L2006. When we excavated the wall L2006, we assigned L2027 to the cobblestone foundation layer and 2028 to the mudbrick debris pack corresponding with L2021 and 2022 in the central part of this southern area. When we excavated the wall in the SW corner, L2020, we assigned L2029 to the cobblestones corresponding with L2019 and L2030 corresponding with the dirt pack equivalent to L2021, 2022, and 2028.       Having leveled the southern section of the trench, we could see a tall-section that we had cut corresponding with the southern face of a mudbrick wall L2010 that we uncovered to the north of the cobblestones of L2009. We had found this mudbrick wall L2010 by removing the topsoil from the area between the 150cm line and the 3m peg (as measured from the south baulk-line), calling this section of topsoil L2005 because we needed our locus numbers to line up sequentially in section. ë_We moved dirt in L2005 between the 150cm mark and the 3m peg and exposed the top of another mudbrick wall, to which we assigned Locus 2010. This new wall runs roughly east-west across the trench and is comprised of a single row of facing bricks on the south side and wider bricks on the north side. Because of the way we had cut L2005, we realized that we had chopped a 30cm drop into L2010 before seeing that it was a wall and not just more mudbrick debris from L2005.       The cobblestones of L2009 abutted this new wall L2010 on the south side only a few cm from the preserved top of the wall L2010. We troweled to find the northern edge of this wall, which appears to have another row of facing bricks on the north side. We would later determine that these north-side facing bricks belong to another wall that was constructed flush against L2010-wall. (See below for discussion of L2036 wall.) The cobblestones of L2019 and the dirt pack corresponding to L2018, 2021 and 2022 all abutted wall-L2010. In order to trace the lowest course of bricks in this wall, we pushed down our leveled-out floor of the southern part of the trench formerly occupied by L2006 and 2020. We assigned Loci 2024 to a diagonally NE-SW-running 20cm wide trench we found in this flattened area. This narrow trench L2024 is several cm below the foundation cobbles of L2027 and L2029, but may have served as a drainage system for the floor L2019 at one time. The appearance of L2024 caused us to split the remainder of the southern part of the trench into two parts L2025 to the south and L2026 to the north. We pushed down L2026 looking for the base course of L2010. Having changed locus in the area corresponding with L2025 and the areas underneath walls L2006 and L2020 to L2032, we pushed down to the base of the trench-L2024. Once that southern section was again flattened, we changed locus for the entire area to L2034 and pushed down several cm (50 total) looking for the base of L2010. Once we were convinced that we saw no more courses, we counted a total of 9 courses on the south side of L2010.       Before removing wall L2010, we wanted to define the relationship between it and another wall we had unearthed to the north of L2010. This new wall, L2036 was situated under Loci 2005, 2011, and 2012. We had changed locus in the area formerly occupied by L2005, assigning new Locus 2011 and pushed down that area looking for any context that might help define the wall L2010. The soil of L2011 was loose and then became harder as we pressed down, therefore we switched to L2012 and continued to excavate the area to the north of L2010. In so doing, we came down on extremely hard mudbricks with mortar lines in L2012 to the north of L2010. This new mudbrick wall was assigned L2036. Because L2010 and L2036 were constructed flush against each other, we consider them to be two parts of a single wall-system. ë_      In order to define the depth of L2036, we shaved off successive layers of mudbricky soil (L2023 and L2033) on the northern side of L2036. These mudbricky layers showed nicely formed pink and yellowish grey mudbricks in section. At the northern edge of L2023, we had pushed down the soil as L2013 and came down on an ash pit L2014 in the west 60cm x 67cm section of the area which corresponds with a clay oven we found situated partly in the east baulk at the 5m peg. Between this oven and the pit lay an area of whiteish dirt which we believe to be a plaster surface, L2016. When this surface L2016 was excavated, it was exposed by scooping and flicking off mudbrick debris with a trowel such that the flat surface became obvious because of the way it was separated from the soil above it. We did not excavate below this plaster surface L2016, nor below the ash pit L2014 this season.       As part of our effort to find the lowest course of bricks in L2036 AND in an effort to trace the plaster surface L2016 back to the south, we removed L2023 and L2033. Under those two loci, we saw a very clearly defined wall, to which we assigned L2037, with one row of body bricks and one row of facing bricks on the south side. This yellow-colored, pebble-filled mudbrick wall is located in the center of this area between the plaster surface L2016 and L2036-wall. We assigned L2038 to the area of mudbricky fill between the walls L2037 and L2036. We assigned L2039 to the area of mudbricky fill north of wall L2037. When we removed L2039, we saw that the plaster surface L2016 and the pit L2014 extend southwards. We determined that the surface L2016 ends at the northern face of wall L2037 because it appears that this wall continues much deeper in section that the surface. We know this because chopped a narrow channel through L2037 and L2038 digging down to the level of the surface L2016. We then saw that the bricks of L2037 continue but the surface L2016 stops as the north face of the wall L2037. We eventually leveled the wall L2037 so that it is even with the base of L2039 and L2038.       We also determined that this leveled area of L2037,2038, 2039 does NOT expose the lowest course of bricks in L2036. Therefore we removed L2038 looking for the base of L2036 but did not find the base of 2036. We changed strategy for finding the base of L2036, deciding to remove L2010 since we had found the base of that wall already. We removed the facing bricks from the north and south sides of L2010 on the east half of wall. Once the facing bricks were removed, we saw a clearly defined ash line running across the body bricks of L2010. We saw in the section of the facing bricks to the west that this ash line did NOT continue into the facing bricks. This ash line was visible in the southern section of L2010 after having removed the facing bricks on that side of the wall. Therefore we knew that the facing bricks on the south side of the body bricks of L2010 correspond with L2010 whereas the facing bricks on the north side belong to L2036. Having fully described L2010, we removed it down to the base where the ash line shows, east side first, then west side. We assigned L2040 to the ash line and scraped it off. Then we assigned L2041 to the mudbrick pack below the ash line and dug down making this locus level with the \floor\ of L2034 in the southernmost part of the trench.       We then removed L2036 because the last two days of excavation were upon us an we wanted to level the southern 2m x 5m section of the trench. We took out L2036 east side first and found below that a beautiful new mudbrick wall L2042. This new wall is composed of alternating pink and grey interlocking bricks. L2042 runs NE-SW at a sharper angle that L2036, therefore we knew we had found the base of L2036 because it was obvious that L2042 was an entirely new entity. We finished removing L2036 in the western half of the trench and determined that L2042 continues westward underneath L2036, although the brick lines are not as clear in the west as they are in the east. It is noteworthy that L2042 has a thin stripe of plaster which runs the length of the northern edge, including the western part of the wall.      In summary, we determined that the walls L2006 and L2020 are roughly contemporary because they are founded on a common cobblestone surface L2019/2027/2029. We also determined that walls L2006 and L2020 are NOT contemporary with L2010 because L2010 extends deeper than the other two walls. We are sure that L2010 and L2036 served as one entity at some point because they are constructed flush against each other, although L2036 may be earlier than L2010 because it ends deeper in section than L2010. (These walls, however, may be constructed as steps down the side of the Tel making it possible that they were constructed at roughly the same time--this is speculation only.) We also determined that the surface L2016, pit L2014 and oven L2015 are later than the wall L2037 because the wall runs deeper in section that the elevation of the plaster surface L2016. It was not possible to determine this season which wall came first, L2037 or L2042. We do know, however, that wall L2037 is earlier than L2036 because L2036 ends higher than L2037 (the bottom of this latter wall has not been excavated yet.).              ,~dc-terms:title: A-2-2000-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2011,"136,2000-08-17," C-1-2000-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1033,","   August 17, 2000      Final day of digging. We took plan shots of L1043, Elvan's street. Then we removed the rocks and flattened to the level of L1037 to the East. After rocks were removed from L1039, L1043, I called the dirt below L1052.   We were beginning to clear L1048 back a few cm to search for lines when a small hole about 5cm in diameter was opened. At first I supposed it to be another animal hole. But it was quite deep. Finally, looking in, I saw a clearly defined circle about 5cm intot he hole - a pot rim for a large pot. The rest of the day was spent digging out this pot. We dropped a corner of L1044 on the East side by 45cm. That gave a good section on L1047 which allowed me to see how far down the bricks went. Farther down it is hard to find lines, but there is still the same solid reddish material. That lasts almost 35cm down until an obvious plaster surface is hit. We dug through that 10cm as ash began to come up. It will be interesting to explore that surface next year. On the East of the pot, I dropped the South part of L1048 60cm. We didn't make it too far through the surface on this side. However, there are definitly bricks in L1048. They are very collapsed and at a funny angle. I left the North part to be used as a study section for this locus in the future. The East side should give an idea of the extent of L1049, though I couldn't see anything right away.   The interesting thing is that the pot was sitting about 5-10cm into the surface seen at the bottom of L1047. I believe they could be related as the plaster seems to creep up on the side of the pot as if it was laid after the pot was put in place. The pot was cracked on the South side due to roots growing through it, but it is relatively whole in the rest. The great thing is there is not too much dirt inside, hence the original large hole we spotted.   I believe the mud brick collapses of L1047 and L1048 to be lying on the surface. We dug out the pot, taped it up and carried it home. We had to dig a large concavity in the baulk. We call this locus L1053. It extends South about 0.3m, it is 1.3m wide and 0.9m high.     ,~: C-1-2000-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1033,"137,2000-08-17," F-1-2000-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1010,","   August 17,2000      I decided to level the rest of the trench to the bottom level of the pit 1010. ( I was planning to level L1016 with L1010 and leave the burial L1011 and the soil around the burial L1013)   We started digging from the South -Eastern corner next to the pit 1010 and we broke a skull at that area. So there is a burial under the pit and the skull was under the rock.   So we searched for other bones at the northern side of the skull but we couldn't find any. According to the bones (we found the piece of the forehead)Andy thinks that is a child. We are now screening the soil from that area and I will put the pieces from the screening to the same bone bag. It is interesting that thay placed the skull under that huge rock.    So the burial will have the locus #1017. Probably we cannot find the borders of the burial because it is the last day, so I will seperate an area for this locus arbitrarily. I will use the borders of the pit L1010 because I think that the pit and the burial are related.    After that we decided that we won't destroy any more bones at the northern side of the trench so we started digging through that direction (1016). We leveled the trench ( L1016) and cut the baulks and took the closing elevations. But may be we will go and take the bones from the burial 1011 this week if we can find enough time.     ,~: F-1-2000-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1010,"138,2000-08-22," B-2-2000-08-022-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2,","B-2-2000   Area B Trench 2   Summary      Trench B2 was opened on the eastern side of the tepe. As a result the western half of the trench sloped downhill. Obviously then loci continuous across the trench in an east-west manner can have quite different elevations.   The topsoil L-2000 was removed rather uneventfully, although the trench was lopsided.   Next came the subtopsoil L-2001. Both these loci had extensive pot sherds from various periods.   While straightening baulks in the north eastern section of the trench an impressive pot smash was found. It was given KT 2010. It took several days to expose it and remove it fully. A new locus L-2003 was created in a 1 meter square around it to preserve context.   We had already created L-2002 in the eastern half of the trench. The soil there was more brown than the western half. On reflection it seems this was only due to the fact that there was more moisture in the soil. It dried and looked the same as L-2001.   L-2004 appeared towards the southern end. It was a reddish area of oven residue with an ash layer L-2012 below it. Probably associated with floor L-2007/L-2011.   Meanwhile rocks began appearing in L-2003. These would jut through the pre-floor layer L-2006 and rest on floor L-2007. They were finally given their own locus L-2022. The pile was obviously associated with the floor as several grindstones were found in its midst. A similar collection of rocks L-2021 was found in the floor area of L-2011. It also contained numerous grindstones.   We found evidence of a mud brick lines in the east and so decided to also dig in the west to perhaps uncover similar evidence. Thus L-2001 became L-2005 as we pushed more carefully looking for mud brick.   We then found what appeared to be an area of surface near L-2003 the meter around the pot smash. We arbitrarily surrounded L-2003 with a new locus L-2006 to make it easier to find the floor in a smaller isolated area. L-2006 was a pre-floor layer. The soil from which was saved to float. This layer popped off the floor fairly easily revealing floor L-2007.   The area south of this was made L-2008. In the hopes that this too was a pre-floor layer. It was and is equal to L-2006.   Scraping for this floor was more interesting as we stumbles upon pit L-2009 in the far south east corner. Pits in this area would continually haunt us, looking like they were finished only to reappear in the section.   At this point the area in L-2003 had been pushed down enough that KT 2010 could be removed. The soil inside was made L-2010 and saved to float under KT 2141 &amp; 2142. The pot went home to be washed.   After digging a bit longer in L-2005 we felt mud brick lines appeared. This area was designated L-2013, and was thought to be a wall. It was eventually found to be a fraud and knocked down. However while we thought it was a wall the area north of it became L-2016. The south became L-2014. L-2014 was cut by a pit/oven area L-2015 which was immediately excavated. It was circular with pot sherds around it and reddish soil. It ended with a rock at the bottom. I assumed this was entirely within the confines of L-2014. So the rock was not given a new locus.   There was an area of small continuous ash pockets taken together as L-2017. This is in the big pit area so it may have all been part of one gigantic pit.   The surrounding area was L-2011 the floor, which was hacked through and made L-2018. To the north floor L-2007 was taken out and made L-2019.   Another hard area appeared and was being articulated in L-2016. This area became L-2020. The area was always tricky as there were intermittent hard spots. However we thought we found good lines and L-2020 was born. Later and 1 meter deeper we realized we'd blown through a wall preserving the collapse as L-2020, which oddly enough is what hindsight is.   An area of rocks sitting on the surface of L-2007/L-2011 and somewhat in L-2018/L-2019 was given L-2021. Several grindstones KT 2074-2076 were found in it. A similar rock pile, upon which KT 2010 was sitting became L-2022. These were isolated pedestaled rocks so the loci were closed when the rocks were removed.   As we dug in L-2014 some changes occurred. A hard mud brick area occurred and was called L-2023. We thought it was a wall stub. To the north of it a large pit occurred, L-2024, cutting the end of the mud brick. We assumed that L-2023 met L-2013 and we'd find lower courses under the pit. Turns out that neither L-2013 or L-2023 were actually walls. They were only collapse and both were removed.   Before L-2023 was unmasked we lived under the assumption that is was a wall. Therefore the are to the east became L-2025 and the area to the west became L-2026.   Also during out digging a new pit occurred in the south east. It became L-2027. This quickly morphed into new parameters and became L-2028.   Finally we had an important break through. A wall with visible, real lines showed up and was designated L-2029. This wall was followed down five courses. It abutted collapse L-2013 &amp; L-2020. It may have a hard surface on the north, but to the south the surface (L-2039) is 20 cm too low and appears to run under the wall. This wall was left standing when the season closed.   Due to the presence of wall L-2029 the north eastern quadrant became L-2030. The south east became L-2031.   The pit system in the south east continues on in the new form of L-2033. Every time we thought it was closed we sprayed the section and saw the continuing line.   Meanwhile the area between L-2020 &amp; L-2013 came up with a great pot smash, KT 2132. It was actually two pot smashes mixed together, but in the field I couldn't separate them accurately. 60 Minutes filmed this pot smash for a while, thank you very much! As a result, not of 60 Minutes, we thought there might be a surface soon so the locus was changed to L-2032.   The pit in the south east corner spread and covered almost all of L-2031. This new form became L-2034.   A pit also appeared in the north east corner, L-2035, cutting L-2030. L-2030 also exhibited oven residue and this pit, but no good context/surface ever appeared. It was eventually leveled and became L-2040.   A pit also appeared in the south west corner, L-2036. Pot smash KT 2208 came out of it. The baulk was tunneled into to get it. I did try to stop that from happening. It ended at rocks. They were not made a new locus since the season closed, but they should be examined in their own right.   Finally L-2023 was removed and the area including the small portion of left of L-2031 became L-2037. This was a pre-floor layer. A beautiful surface, L-2039, came up in the south east ending the huge pit complex. It extended across the south of the trench, but its existence in the north was not confirmed.   A series of rocks appeared in the north west and became L-2038. They were free floating, but could be associated with the wall in the north baulk we destroyed. Perhaps as a foundation for the wall. They were all taken out. The soil underneath had a high concentration of horse piss soil.   Finally L-2032, L-2020 &amp; L-2030 were all taken down looking for the floor. it was a cursory look since we closed down. The floor was not found definitively so the north area of the trench became L-2040.   Watch for mud brick lines that began appearing in the south western end of the trench. They are just north of the rocks in the corner. It seems that a good wall is appearing there.           ,~: B-2-2000-08-022-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 2,"139,2001-06-19," G-1-2001-06-019-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 1,","   Week 3 trench summary   June 19, 2001      This week we excavated G1, G2, and G4. Starting with G1 we dug from 74.83 meters 'till 73.96 meters. All the loci this week were a sandy/rocky matrix. Originally, Bradley though that it may be a floor; but after digging almost a meter more we realize that it is probably some sort of natural deposit. All loci were sterile this week.       This interesting geological phenomenon was also found in G2, but 80 cm. below where it was found in G1. We found some pottery and some bone from 75.19 meter 'till 73.97 meters. We finally hit the sterile layer after breakfast today. We dug through the rocky, sandy, sterile strat. until 73.64 meters---no artifacts were found.       We excavated G4 yesterday and today. We didn't find anything too interesting, but we did consistently come across pottery in each locus. It is assumed now that we will eventually come down on the same rocky, sandy matrix as discovered in G1 and G2.      If nothing else, G1 and G2 have raised important Geological questions for us. Why is there such a large sandy, rocky matrix? Is this a product of some massive ancient flood? Bradley and Andy are both shying away from the idea of excavating here after finding this large sterile layer---but they both want to wait and see what G3 and G4 reveal.      ,~: G-1-2001-06-019-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 1,"140,2001-07-02," A-2-2001-07-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2,","   Datum readings for A-2      EastWest      4m98.2534m98.427   8m96.0238m96. 253   12m93.68212m93.922   16m91.43216m91.607   20m89.19720m89.367   24m87.19524m87.343   28m85.07728m85.383   32m83.06932m83.408      July 2, 2001    Before the workers cleaned the plants, bushes around the trench and we organized path ways.

This topsoil was dubbed L2015 and ranged from 1cm-17cm in depth before features from last season's final top plan could be discerned.   In the center of the trench, a cobble floor (L2016) was uncovered. This is probably the same feature as last season's L2011, L2012 and L2013. Another possible pebble surface was uncovered along the northern baulk (L2020). In the SE corner a few patches of plaster were uncovered (L2022). Towards the northern half of the western baulk, a group of possibly associated rocks (10cm-40cm) was uncovered (L2018) which appear to have some large sherds of pottery intermingled.

The  ock feature\ which was in it now appears to have been random deposit from said erosion.   Scattered animal bones and ash deposits, along with some mudbrick (collapse?) began to appear across the entirety of L2017.

The platform was placed so we were unable to read the meter stick and take readings in the north/east corner. We spent time this morning taking out part of the hill so we could read the elevations. We took opening elevations and immediately split the trench into 2 different loci. The oven we knew was there from last year's excavations L4023 and the rest of the area that was contaminated with eroded baulk and topsoil L4022. Both loci needed cleaning from all this eroded material. KT's 4104-4108 and 4112 are all contaminated bags.   We took off 15 cm of top soil in L4023. After that the ash began to appear in the oven again. We changed KT's and these new bags are clean and definitely from the oven and not topsoil. We saved some of this soil for a flotation sample. We are also screening everything that comes out of the oven. We've found several carbonized seeds in the oven that appear to be a cereal.   The north/west corner of the trench began producing a dark gray soil (10 YR 3/1 Very dark gray) as we took off the topsoil. We gave this area a new locus L4024. This is consistent with the area as it was last season.   We felt we had removed all of the topsoil as some harder areas were starting to come up. We closed L4022 and opened new loci. The south end of the trench we divided in half for better control. The west half is L4025 and the east is L 4026. L 4026 may have some mudbrick coming up near the baulk.   We pushed down 10cm, which ended up as 5cm in reality in L4025. A potsmash is appearing. There might be a surface present which may articulate with the oven. We quit today before we could articulate more than a small portion.   Also pushed down 10cm in the west half of L4023 the oven. The section shows that it's still continuing and the soil is still ashy so we'll push down the other half tomorrow. Aziz found a rodent burrow in the farthest north/east section of L4023.

Baris also finished placing the sandbags around the southern perimeter of the trench to ward off evil spirits (and curious visitors). He also finished taking elevations on the east side of the trench, using the total station.

Our primary goal for this week was to remove all the topsoil and deposited erosion from between the seasons. This layer was rather extensive, almost 20 cm at its thickest, probably due to the position of the trench on the steep eastern slope of Kenan Tepe.   Nevertheless, after the removal of the topsoil (L2015) the cobble surface was quickly identified (and assigned L2016), as well as a previously undiscovered area of plaster patches in the SE corner of the trench (L2022, ~.6m x .6m). Another, smaller area of cobbles (L2020) began to appear towards the NE corner of the trench. Along a 2 meter stretch of the western baulk, it initially appeared that a rock feature was appearing (L2018) but this was later discredited when some red baulk line from the previous season was uncovered running underneath the feature. Apparently the feature was simply deposition.   L2017 (which covers the whole SW corner of the trench roughly) was excavated for about 5 cm before a soil change occurred, with scattered ash, animal bones and mud brick appearing. L2019 (the N of the trench 2.2m x 2.2m) was excavated, though it is not clear at this time whether the soil change evident in L2017 continues into it or L2018. The same soil may also continue under L2016, so loci reassignments wait until that area is excavated.     ,~: D-2-2001-07-05-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2,"157,2001-07-05," C-1-2001-07-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1054,","   July 5, 2001      It has become time to open C1 again for the 2001 season at Kenan Tepe.

I will put L1054 here to collect material. I opened KT1433 for the nice pottery we are pulling up. The corner is being flattened and red dirt with white chunks is coming up. It is soft dark dirt. There are many stones around and everywhere the baulks are looking like a surface. The problem is that there is only a very small corner with this stuff in it. That makes it hard to see anything, hopefully C4 will give some ideas. Last year there was a layer of mudbrick running NE-SW across the SE corner of the trench. Now it appears there is a line of rocks, big ones which are decimeters across, running directly under those bricks which were L1049.   We also straightened the rest of the South baulk and had KT opened for bone and lithics from those parts.   The South baulk this year is straight which means we cut all the way to the back of last year_Ñés L1053, most of which collapsed. This has made the trench larger, but the baulk straight.

We are digging here because last season in area C2 there was found what could be a copper producing area It contained copper slag and slag pits which were not identified during the season. I hope to find similar things in trench C3 so we can do an in-depth analysis of the area which may be a primary reason for the occupation of the city during the time period. I started by digging the eastern half (the uphill side) of the trench which was L3000 and composed of a loose, eroded topsoil. After 20 cm or so I go through the topsoil to what I think is a sub-topsoil and closed L3000 and opened L3001 and L3002. L3001 is the western half of the trench and is composed of the same type of topsoil in L3000. L3002 is a more compact sub-topsoil which contains a poorly preserved plaster surface and a potsmash on the plaster surface all in the southern half of the locus. The northern half of the locus remains un-excavated. Next week I hope to find the rest of the plaster surface in L3002 and bring L3001 down to the sub-topsoil and see if it connects with locus 3002.     ,~: C-3-2001-07-05-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3,"162,2001-07-05," G-1-2001-07-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 1/Locus 1000,","   July 5, 2001   Area G is an obvious morphological area that consists of a low rise north of Kenan Tepe's main mound. It is directly north of trench A2 on the path between Area C and Area F. The rise itself is approximately 2 meters higher than the flat area leading to Area F. The fact that this area is an obvious morphological unit led us to the conclusion that it might contain cultural deposits. To test this theory we decided to excavate several small 1 by 1 meter soundings. Our hope is that these soundings will first tell us if the rise of Area G is in fact cultural deposition and if so, what period it dates to. If Trench G1 is productive we will open more soundings to determine the approximate extent of occupation.    We began G1 on July 5, 2001. I opened the first locus as L1000 (top soil) and let Erol use the big pick to remove the top soil layer. Unfortunately very little pottery was unearthed in the first 30 centimeters (excavated as KT1000). Since this pottery could have been driven into the ground by plowing or by animal herds, at the end of the day it was still unclear if Area G is a cultural deposit. Since we got started on this sounding only after breakfast, we only removed the top soil layer on July 5.        ,~: G-1-2001-07-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 1/Locus 1000,"163,2001-07-05," C-3-2001-07-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3001,","   July 5, 2001      Today while the workers continued digging the topsoil in L3001 I cut a small window in L3002 West of the pottery base to see if it was sitting on a floor.

I cleaned to baulk at the SW corner of L3002 and found a bit of plaster so I think the plaster under the pottery base continues to the south baulk. We followed the plaster surface to the south baulk also removing the pottery base which ended up being the top of a vessel instead of the bottom.

A single row of larger stones was uncovered on both the W and E edges, with no cobbles outlying, establishing a border to the wall (excavation work was also done in L2021, along the E baulk, ~ 4m x 1.5m, to authenticate this assertion, and aside from a few unassociated, scattered pebbles, there was nothing to suggest the architecture of L2016 extended past the wall edge). There may be a similar wall edge along S face, however, there are a couple larger stones which rest beyond the line which would form the wall. My guess is that they're tumble from a second course or similar that has since disappeared. The wall runs SW-NE.   L2020 (NE, ~ 1m x 1m), which I originally thought was part of the same -surface- as L2016, appears to be a severed portion of the wall, though in a much more degraded condition (no edges are clearly visible, and the cobbles are a bit more scattered). I tried to connect the two loci by excavating the area between them (which I dubbed L2024, and is ~ .7m x 1m), but the locus contained only scattered cobbles. The general shape of the wall is maintained, though, and there is little cobble scattering outside of the area the wall, if it continued as per L2016, would occupy. I imagine the condition of L2020 can be attributed to either a) the same disturbance as the severing of L2020 and L2016; or b) its position lower on the slope, with less material and fill accumulated above it.   I also had a portion of L2022 (SE, ~ 1m x 1m) excavated, around the large stones on along the edge of the locus facing into the trench, but they have no discernable connection to L2016. A few centimeters of L2021 (E side, ~4m x 1.5m) were excavated, and turned up only soil and pot sherds, but nothing to suggest the architecture of L2016 continued past its aforementioned edge.   In the final clean-up of the trench, a second layer of stones similar to the edge stones on the E face of the wall turned up immediately below those which are part of L2016, but with a few degrees different orientation, suggesting an earlier wall or foundation which L2016 was built atop.     ,~: D-2-2001-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2016,"166,2001-07-07," C-1-2001-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1054,","   July 7, 2001      We continue to clean after taking elevations with the total station.

I did this because when I looked in the east baulk I found plaster pieces eroded throughout which leads me to believe that what I thought was a plaster surface might be plaster eroding down from the top of the hill. This sounding trench will make a mini baulk where I can then see if there is a surface or not. Because L3002 remains largely un-excavated and probably a sub-topsoil, the trench will remain in L3002.

She appears to have gotten the hang of the system in her days with Elvan.    One interesting note about L1001 is that there were many rather large pieces of lime in the matrix of the locus. We collected this lime as a separate KT (KT1002). At the end of the day I gave Sibel and our workman a lesson in balk cleaning. The balks were almost done by the end of the day.

We wanted to push down L4024, a section that we had put on hold for a while. After scraping around the gray area looks pretty contained in a triangular area in the NW corner of the trench. Renamed the remaining area L4029. Next to it is a much softer area so that became L4030. The section in L4028 looks like the hard area is not a wall. However, we have mudbrick in the section right on the slump. We pulled back L4026 away from it. When we did the dirt looked reddish and there was an ash line that followed the line we thought was the wall. We are now pushing across the trench leveling the ash line to see if there is a continuing wall or surface. We will continue this tomorrow.   We took down the soft area L4030 10cm. It is now level with the pit L4024 that we dug 15-20 cm in. L4030 was very sandy and produced very minimal amounts of artifacts. Only a couple of bone pieces and one or two pieces of pottery. As we dug we left a buffer zone around L4027, also known as the oven wall, so that we did not collapse it.   As we dug the oven L4023 we continued to find extreme amounts of bone. We also found three loom weights. These were given KT4159. There are large amounts of bone in situ that we photographed and will remove from the earth tomorrow.    Finally, while sweeping around area L4025 near the end of the day, an area with sandy soil in between larger harder areas, we found something cool.

It seems the same as L4001 but we are very close to the levels of L4018 and L4017 so I changed the locus to avoid any mistakes. Now I will take some photographs (L4019).   We are still digging the NW side of the trench. There are more rock formations similar to the other 1/4's in this quarter of the trench too. So the workers are now cleaning that part. Then I think I will make them start articulating. But for today I also want to go deeper in the SE side of the trench too. I don't know which one I will start.   I got Pete's workmen so I can do both at the same time. In the SE 1/4 they started to level the trench with the L4003 in L4005. But not touching the L4015.   In the NW 1/2 next to the W baulk there were some stones. When we articulated that we found out that stones are within a circular formation (oven or storage bin or something circular with smooth walls.) So we are cleaning that really well right now.   In the SE 1/2 when they were digging to S they found a hole. Might be a snake hole or something like that but still I closed that with a plastic bag. Maybe it is an opening to a tomb(!)   The circle that has rocks in it in the NW 1/4 is L4020. We are digging the NW 1/2's S half 5 cm more from W to E to find out more about the rocks next to the artificial baulk btw NW and SW 1/4's.     ,~: C-4-2001-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4/Locus 4001,"172,2001-07-08," D-2-2001-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2/Locus 2016,","   July 8, 2001      The better part of the day was spent stringing and removing topsoil and brush from D4 while D1 and D2 were being photographed for posterity. I did have time to work on \peeling\ back a layer of the wall in L2016 (center, ~ 2m x 1.5m). In articulating the S and E edges of the wall (the S is now clearly a face) it appears that L2016 is superimposing a previous wall with a slightly different orientation. The goal was to get this top layer removed to better see the older feature. For the excavation L2016 was replaced by L2025. Prior to excavation, the small finds which had been lying on the surface of L2016 were removed: KT 2135, a half spindle whorl; KT 2136 a whetstone; and KT 2141, a scraper. A grind stone (KT 2142) was also removed from L2016's northerly neighbor, L2024, where is was lying on the surface.   A second level of flat lying pottery was uncovered about 6 cm below the level of L2016, and was where the surface was \peeled\ to. A second grind stone, KT 2143 was uncovered in the process. There may be a mudbrick face attached to the S edge of wall, but it is not clear at this time.   I think the wall without the L2016/L2025 surface have multiple courses, so no more \peeling\ until the surrounding loci have been excavated to prove or disprove such.   Unfortunately, before I could finish digging, the wind kicked up and snapped a couple tent poles, bringing a brief, unceremonious finish to the day's work.

Also we start to level the center in a new L1059.   L1056 is bringing up burned pieces of dirt. The whole locus is quite hard packed. There are lots of bones. It seems, by the West baulk, to be quite perfectly sealed by bricks above. We cut it straight about 1m from the North baulk, because stuff was coming up like burnt dirt and coloration. I will check to see what I can see.   We started to dig Eastward in L1059 with the big pick but we kept coming up with large artifacts so we slowed down.

After cleaning the loose dirt I found light reddish brown pieces of something coming up in the middle of the locus. Also there are traces of plaster and what look to be the tops of stones coming through. I will go down 5 cm to start off with tomorrow to see if this is a feature of wall of something coming through.

We removed a few centimeters of topsoil from the entire trench ( a safety precaution to prevent tumble downhill into D1 or its immediate S) and took off about 20cm along the W baulk (the uphill baulk).      We are leaving an interior baulk around the sounding in the former D3 (which occupied about 4m square of the NE corner of the trench) as a stratigraphic guide until we reach the level of the sounding in the trench at large.

Also we dug in L3004 which is the fill of the oven in the south baulk of L3002. Finally we brushed the entire area to try to define any surfaces or features.   When digging in L3001 which is classified as topsoil we found rocks that are on average 10-20 cm. These rocks when articulated seem to go along with the rocks found yesterday. The rocks continue south into an area that has not been excavated. There seems to be rocks underneath that may be a second course. I am labeling this L3005. We found a piece of obsidian in L3001.    The oven fill L3004 contains soft, fine dirt a couple of charred bones, some small flakes of burned something, some pottery fragments and pieces of the oven top that has collapsed in. The oven remains in excellent condition. After the fill was taken out two interesting things were found. First there was some light pinkish clay at the bottom that seems to be present on every side of the bottom of the oven. Second, there are two holes in the wall of the oven one on the north side and one on the south. This may be one of three things. First it could just be collapsed in, second it could be there to stoke the fire or third it could be for the removal of slag and or metal products. If the third is true there should be a slag pit near by. Maybe in the south baulk.   After we swept the area with fine brushes we found three things. What seems to be a pit with cement, slag like material in it. This is near the center of L3002 and near the eastern baulk. The second was an oven which was the clay material that was mentioned earlier which was in the North baulk near the western edge. The third is what could be mudbrick in the NE edge of L3001.

We also pushed back section L4025 and section L4026 about 10 cm. L4029 appears to be the same material as L4025 and L4026. Minimal amounts of pottery and bone came from these loci. While working on L4025 we uncovered the edge of what we hoped would be a complete pot (KT4162). We got elevations on the edge as well as a photo. We pushed down another 5 cm around the shard to see if it was a complete pot, as well as to find a surface. We screened the dirt in this area. There are also some roots in this locus (L4025). Well, it wasn't a complete pot, but it is a very nice diagnostic shard, maybe one-third of a complete pot.   After scraping the area a clear red line appeared. The soil to the north of it was a sticky, smooth, reddish clay this became L4031. The soil south of the line is loamy and more brown (L4032). Even though the red line does not extend to the edge the differences in the soil are marked so we extended the locus boundary. Pushed down the south half of L4025 to see if we can extend this red boundary. We'll push north tomorrow on L4029 to see if this similar red clay is part of the same thing.   As we dug the oven a wonderful bone awl came out. We gave it KT4174 and I will lovingly shepherd it home to show to my sick husband who is in bed with a stomach virus. We also got a nice rim sherd KT4171 and a large piece in situ that we photographed. It should mend with pieces from KT4170.   After troweling around L4029 that is level it looks like the line of the pit may extend under the areas L4030 and L4029. I am closing L4024 and redefining its boundaries in a new locus L4033. The soil also looks less dark and ashy than it previously did enforcing the need for a new locus.    The oven pulled out a lot of ash today.

Then we moved on to the middle of the trench L1059. We dug in two pieces, North and South both heading East. This keeps both workmen busy. We are finding tons of little stuff, ash. I had to open a bunch of carbon bags. Some good pieces came out, and a lot of crumble. I started to put the crumble for the North into one piece of foil and the crumble for the South into one. I will separate only really good pieces. Then there were some small black round things that the workmen consider to be seeds.   They do seem to be carbonized seeds. There was one on the South side I bagged as KT1475. On the North side was a very round piece and maybe a second seed, I bagged as KT1477. Most of the carbon samples are taken well, with a trowel and into foil. The only issue is that because they tend to be small, a lot of dirt is mixed into them.   On the South we are articulating a pile of small rocks and pottery _ÑÐ potentially some sort of feature although the pieces are pretty small, there are a lot.   On the North we are approaching last year_Ñés architecture. We found half a large donut shaped rock. Elvan has just found one similar to it, we are curious to know if they are the same piece. We tried, but they didn_Ñét fit. I am now digging to articulate the middle of this locus.   We find some more seeds so we put them in a film canister. Also I will collect ash into one bag with many foils, KT1478. After breakfast we continue chopping into L1059. I want to straighten its section so we may see something.   There are many small pebbles under the mound. We will clean and look. Then it is time to change loci. The dirt around the rocks on top should be one. The rocks themselves will then be another.

Notably, a hollow is appearing under the cobble surface. It does not appear to be any sort of animal burrow, but whether it is an architectural anomaly, a burial, or something else entirely remains to be seen. Once the surface was uncovered it was redesignated L2028.   The plaster patches of L2022 (SE corner, ~ 1m x 1m) were removed as L2027, as they could not be followed and there were no other clear surface markers. The possible oven did not materialize. A surface was faintly visible, post-excavation, in the S section. The three large stone demarking the interior border of the locus were all free standing with no apparent association (to anything...) and were removed.   Finally, L2020 (N, ~ 1m x 1m) was excavated, hoping to find some sort of surface level. However, after 7 cm of digging (as L2026), leaving large stones in place, the area still is nothing more than a jumble.

Most interestingly we found an oven abutting the south part of the pit which is now L3008 and the fill inside L3009. The oven does not seem to be well preserved. The oven may be a metal smelting oven and the pit next to it could be its slag pit. It will be interesting to see it once it is excavated. A bit further south is a stone door post. What makes this particularly interesting is that this is the same type of thing that is being found in C4. A door stop and a pit with slag. In the area around the pit we found a piece of metal that does not seem to be refined. It is similar to iron filings. It is black with a couple of rust spots. It tastes metallic when tasted.

We also see mudbrick rows in the cut made by L2051 when looking to the west--these bricks are (from the north to south):   -one missing from last night circa 10cm wide x10cm thick   -one 24cm wide x 10cm thick   -one 27cm wide x 27cm broad x 11cm thick (we found the top of this brick)   -one 10cm wide x 11cm thick   The bricks in L2053 are Munsell 10YR 5/3 'brown'      We excavated this 1m x 1.85m pedestalled section in the SW corner of the trench as 2 loci because the northern part has white mortar bits whereas the southern part does not. L2052 is flush against the south baulk and L2053 is to the north of L2052. We took \progress\ pictures to show the tiers of white-ish (10YR 7/2 'light grey') mortar that is now showing in the moistened soil of L2053. This is the exact same kind of shifty 'plaster' lines we saw in the northern half of L2051 yesterday (see  7/10/2001). Bradley says these are the sunken mortar lines between layers of brick. These white-ish lines show in the northern half of L2053 and were repeated in the ensuing layers of this locus as we dug downwards.       We dug L2053 down about 7cm, to take off one course of bricks. We left the western 40cm section of L2053 standing so we could follow those mortar lines with the trowel. After the 7cm came off the east part of L2053, we tried to find brick lines with the sprayer and we THINK we saw 4 (or possibly 5?) rows of bricks oriented NE-SW with one band of thicker bricks included in the 4 rows (i.e., circa 24-27cm thick). This wider band of bricks corresponds with the 2nd or 3rd brick we peeled off in the 1st 7cm of L2053-east. So we could have more courses of this wall emerging. The trouble is that we don't see the division of bricks within the band/row. We had the workers remove that course (c.7cm more) and trowel flat again. The 2nd 7cm layer of L2053 had chunks of the mortar lines of white soil again--very consistent color: Munsell 10YR 7/2 again.      After the 2nd 7cm layer of L2053 was removed we saw at least 3 bands / rows of brick lines (but not individual bricks in the bands) running at a sharper SW-NE orientation when we compared these bands with L2042 (zebra wall from last year); ie, the bricks in L2053 are not the same entity as L2042.       The 3rd layer of soil in L2053-east yielded brick material of Munsell 5YR 5/3--reddish brown. This soil was also medium to fine silt loam, hard packed with few pebbles, sherds. We will clean and straighten and then after kahvalti we'll spray again and look at the section, since the base of 2053-east will be even with the base of L2051.       After kahvalti we trowelled back the western half of L2053 to follow the white plater threads. We took a picture once the planes of plaster were exposed. We picked off (with the trowel) the nothern two rows of circa 10cm x 10cm bricks (top course) to look at how the bricks meet the plaster line in /next to the baulk. We cut back the north side of L2053-west but cannot see clear lines in section --there is a large root in the section here which may be distorting the section. But from the top, having troweled down only 3cm we see the outlines of poorly preserved brick rows (maybe 5 rows?). One plastered brick fragment (see photo) is 11cm wide x 24cm long. the bricks do not meet the plaster line at the west baulk in 90-degree angle, but maybe more like a 100-degree (ie., slightly obtuse).       We measured the brick and had the workers remove about 7-10 cm of L2053-west. After clearing this layer we cleaned again and sprayed. We saw more white mortar planes/fragments, but they are non-continuous with each other. A distinct brick 23cm x 13cm oriented SSW-NNE at the baulk (but not touching the baulk) and other less-well defined mudbrick chunks oriented at skewed angles to this 23 x 13 brick suggests that this western part of L2053 is mudbrick debris or wall collapse, rather than a wall itself. This possibility is underscored by the EAST-facing plaster on the wall preserved in the west baulk; i.e., we see the INSIDE of the wall making the material in L2053 collapse from the upper levels of a wall (maybe the same wall preserved in the baulk?). We had the workers move another c. 5cm which yielded more scattered planes of plaster material. There were no clear brick lines aside from the plaster bits, so we had the workers remove the remaining portion of L2053 such that it is now level with the base of L2051. It looks like the wall preserved in the west baulk has courses continuing to the base of L2053.      We photographed the base of L2053 and the west baulk and had the workers trowel down 1cm/ 2cm at the base of L2051 and L2053.      Baris and Ellie also re-measured the entire trench and corrected all the drawings on the dayplan. So starting today the top plan is ACCURATE!

In the south of 3001 we found a surface with many animal bones and pottery fragments scattered around it. It seems to be a work area so designated it L3010. The wall L3005 comes down and looks to separate the work area and something that remains un excavated to the east of it. Also, where the wall meets the work surface there is a large, 15 cm, slag chunk. What may be happening here is the wall separating a work surface from something else.

Elvan also opened a 10x10 meter trench directly east and on the south side of C1. We are curious to trace some of the uphill architecture. I have two workers usually, Ramazan from last year and Mizba, a new guy. We have spent most of the week cleaning up from last year. I opened up a big locus across the whole trench, L1054 in order to keep most of the collapse from the off season. Collapse happened differently in each section depending on what was left. I was most interested in the Southeast corner where there had been the whole pot, some bricks and a surface last year. However, that was all gone and the baulk even collapsed above the pot. There is still evidence of a wall cutting the corner there. We leveled and saw nothing else on the floor. In the baulk, the metal people Lynn and Jonathan were both excited to see some slag where the baulk had collapsed and some of the pebble layers below, all along the south baulk. We also cleaned the Northeast corner a little bit, but all the rocks along the East baulk could have been disturbed because I no longer see the corners I had last year. It has always been hard to trace the architecture on this baulk and I doubt I will be able to do much until Elvan digs C4 down on the East side to our level.   On the west side we dug L1056 where there was one small course of mudbricks last year. The dirt is hard packed below those bricks. The baulk section shows those bricks quite clearly. There was some potential iron that fell out of last year_Ñés L1040.   On the south wall we started to probe and found a potential ashy surface. I want to cut down to it, so I am leaving it alone while the rest of the trench drops around it.   We finished up the week by articulating a pile of pottery and rocks which runs North-South through the middle of the trench. There are some interesting pieces coming out of this section. Also there are a lot of carbon samples coming up. This stuff seems to be in a line, so it may have been that it fell off the edge of something. The uphill side is some    Associated with that, we found some continuation of the ashy pits which were last year called L1050 and L1051. Now we have opened L1063 and L1062 to collect material from these pits.

The large oven L4023 was treated as a separate locus from the beginning, as it was obviously still a continuing feature. The oven, pit L4023 has continued to produce extreme amounts of pottery and animal bones throughout the week. There seem to be alternating ash lenses and the bones are not burned. Therefore it looks like there has been dumping of garbage (bones) and dumping of ash rather than lots of trash burning. As of yet, we have not found a surface connected with this large feature, but we are still working around the oven.   There may be a wall appearing. The fill in the trench can be divided into two types. There is a hard red clay which runs NW-SE which could be the top of a wall. It came up with a clear red line after the fill of L4025 and L4026. Across the line is a loose brown soil. This red clay could be a brick wall like those in the earlier strata of the trench. We are at a point where we can seriously consider combining several loci that seem to be equal into a new entity.   There are two pits (L4033 and L4034), in addition to the large oven, which cut the trench. Both of these have produced large carbon samples as well as large amounts of pottery and bone. These may be extra dumping sites for the large trash pit (oven). We may have hit the county dump!   The most notable find of the week was a cylinder seal (KT4132). This was found in an area of hard earth above L4034. It looks as though there may be bricks in the section. These could be slump from the oven or the new wall which may appear. This may give the seal some context, but at this point it was found in what can only be described as fill.   Next week we plan to continue excavating L4023, ascertain if we have reached virgin soil in L4033, and establish further if indeed there is a large wall coming up in the center portions of the trench, and then go from there.     ,~: F-4-2001-07-12-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4,"204,2001-07-12," F-4-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4023,","   July 12, 2001      We began the day by Munselling the yellow streaks in L4034 with the Munsell 2.5y 6/4 light reddish brown. Then we began to take it down 5 cm at a time, first the south half and then the north half.   We also pushed down pit L4033 which amazingly is still continuing.   As that happened on the other side of the trench we took a soil sample of the yellow in L4034. It got larger and covered almost the entire area of the pit. We took a photo of it and then proceeded to dig some more.    `Straightened the baulks.   We took out some broken pieces of pottery that fit together from L4023 but it was not quite a complete potsmash (KT4207). We haven't dug the pit in two days, so these pieces may mend with others from KT4170 on July 9. The oven is clayey today with scattered ash pockets. We also found in the east part of the oven a large mudbrick in a weird shape. We are leaving it in the trench for now, as it looks embedded in the wall of the oven. We also found a large, probably pig, jawbone. We took the elevation as well as photos of the jawbone and the mudbrick.   As we dug L4034 the yellow color began retreating towards the baulk. When we quit today there was still a 7cm streak left. The pit continues, so we will continue with it on Saturday the 14th.   L4033, the other pit, looks as though it has reached a conclusion as a pit, but we have not formally closed the locus yet. It looks as though we have the red clay coming up and there may be small plaster pebbles in it. There is a chance that it is virgin soil, but there are strata in the upper baulk that look as though they might be the same thing. We will reevaluate on the 14th.    We found a piece of stone that looks like the half of a loom weight while screening L4023.

Thus the dayplans for this section of the trench reflect the extra 25cm on east and west sides. We continued to move topsoil L2043 on the north end of the trench such that the trench is now 19.5m long. We laid fixed points along east and west sides; these points will also serve as datums for reading elevations in A-2.       In terms of excavating, this week we concentrated in two places in the trench (aside from moving topsoil at the north end) : the middle section between the 7m and 9m pegs and the southernmost 2x2m section. In the middle section, we came down on a surface (L2047 and 2048) after having found a potsmash (L2046) in the east baulk at the 8m peg. After removing L2046 and L2047-2048 we came down on an earlier incarnation of the surface (L2049). We did not excavate L2049 yet. Instead we shifted our attention to the questions from last year that remained/remain unanswered in terms of the relationship between the walls L2042 and L2034 in the southern part of the trench.       We dug the southern 2x2 section as L2051 (eastern half) and L2052-2053 (western half where 2053 contained fragments of white brick mortar). We exposed a plastered wall preserved in the west baulk and believe that the adjacent loci (L2052 and 2053) are mudbrick collapse. In 2053 we found several well-preserved bricks, but could not trace more than one course of contiguous bricks in the eastern cut of 2053. After removing L2051-2052-2053 we trowelled the area that links L2042 to the base of 2051-2053. Although we clarified the well-preserved white plaster line on the north side of L2042, we could not determine how/where the south side of L2042 continues as it moves to the west. We will pick up this question next week, possibly by dropping a 20cm deep probe into 2042-2053. The southern 0-2m of the trench is now level with the 2-5m section.       We also excavated the pit (L2044; last year's L2014) at the 4-5m pegs. We have not yet determined the relationship between the pit and the walls to the south of it.      ,~: A-2-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2,"206,2001-07-12," C-3-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3001,","   July 12, 2001   Today we dug the fill L3008 out of oven L3007. Also we scrapped east from L3010.    In the fill we found mostly found small pieces of pottery and a couple of small flecks of burned material but not enough to get a sample of it. We took a soil sample from the fill. It ends up that the oven does not go very deep , maybe 10 cm. The top is broken probably because of its closeness to the topsoil as it is 15-20 cm down. Looking at the oven it seems that it abuts the slag pit L3009 and is probably associated as there is a good chance that the oven could be a metal producing oven and the pit next to it is the pit for the slag run off. More interestingly when poking around in the oven I found that part of the side of the oven which abuts the pit is missing. Either this is to allow slag to run off or that piece just broke off and fell away.   When scraping the area east of L3010, basically the area 2 m north of the southern baulk between L3010 and the end of L3002, the workers made a kind of divit and dug about a cm or 2 below the current level of 3010. This means that either we are on a separate surface or in the middle of L3010. Either way, the work area L3010 tapers off and the surface clears of almost all bones and pottery. Thus I am designating it L3011. While scrapping we found very small pieces of burnt earth, oven fragments, small flecks of coal and several small slag pieces. Also near the northern edge there seems to be a line where the earth gets harder and more compact. This may be a continuation of a wall or something of that sort. We found a squareish rock with a circular divit in it like a door post. What could be happening is a wall coming from the east then a door way and then the other side of the wall and a connecting wall L3005. I will understand more when I articulate the area.      ,~: C-3-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3001,"207,2001-07-12," C-4-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4,","   July 12, 2001   2ND WEEK SUMMARY:   In the second week of the excavation we found more stone features. First of all we identified another rock grouping, which is a possible surface at the SE part of the trench, and we named it as L4015. Also when we articulated the extended L4002 we identified that is not a locus so I separated the part that I added into it. (L4016)   Then we started to work in the NW side of the trench where we immediately found a rock feature that disappears under the artificial baulk. So we took that baulk off at that part of the trench. This locus seems to be a wall especially with the next locus that is located just at the N of this one: Two door posts with a possible threshold according to our guesses. (L4018) After finding these rock features I changed the locus for the fill between these loci, which is L4019. Also at this level we fond an oven next to the W baulk that is covered with rocks or possibly cut by a rock feature. (L4020)   We were thinking that L4006 was a burial so we decided to open that feature so we set a frame around it and we named the soil around it as L4021 and took the rocks off but we couldn_Ñét find any bones in it. We dig the soil around it deeper than the rest of the trench so I will leave that part as how it is right now until we dig this part of the trench deeper.   Also in the NW part of the trench we found some more rocks in the middle so we opened a locus for those which is L4023. When articulating that we identified that there is another rock grouping there next to the artificial baulk between NW &amp; SW portions. (L4022)   The interesting part of this week was the theories of the slag production area according to the features having the same properties: oven or oven like features with some mud brick, rocks and possible slag around these features.      ,~: C-4-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4,"208,2001-07-12," D-5-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,","   Week 2 summary, week ending July 12, 2001      The primary goal of this week in D5 was to get it ready for proper digging, which involved taking out the baulk separating D1 and its northerly neighbor D2. Seemingly a simple task, it quickly became clear that the majority of the western part of the baulk was, in fact, a mudbrick wall almost completely concealed in the baulk (possibly some bleed into D1)--L5004, 5005, 5012, 5014.   The next stage was to nicely clean the entire trench and set up loci. Having already found the E-W wall, we had the whole trench sprayed with water and found a lot more mudbrick, mostly along the western baulk (L5008, 5019, 5018). From a couple early soundings (L5017/16, 5009 and 5007) it appears the extended feature may be a mudbrick road of some sort as it seems to have only a single course.   Another layer was removed from the N-central feature (L5015), and it is now down to a surface (which appears to be the last, thanks to sounding L5006) which looks contemporary with the mudbrick architecture. A coupe theories floating around about its purpose, including the possibility is served as a small staircase. Lots of pottery and lithics, no bone whatsoever.   After more digging in the NE pebble jumble (L5020), it continues...   The rest of the trench (the majority of the eastern portion) is occupied by areas of fill and possibly some pits. The lack of architecture might be because it was never there or because it is much nearer to the original surface of the tepe and whatever was there has been degraded.   Next week it would be good to finally be rid of the N-central stone feature, find the context of all the mudbrick architecture and possibly remove it, and look into the surface that is appearing immediately below the mudbrick level.        ,~: D-5-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"209,2001-07-12," A-3-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 3/Locus 3000,","   July 12, 2001      Moved only a little dirt in A3 today (about 10cm in the eastern end of the trench along the A1/A3 boundary). Uncovered 3 burials, though. Two of these are in association with 10-15 cm diameter spots of softer sediments which at first were thought to be post-holes or rodent burrows. Their level of origin is at approximately 99.60-99.65 meters. Both of these are small and appear at this point to be juvenile crania. The third individual is represented only by a portion of long bone and is actually located in A1 along the A1/A3 boundary (about 5N, 14W). This individual was uncovered while attempting to establish a solid profile in the west wall prior to moving into the other two burials. It may well be associated with the ulna recovered from the same area last year. All three were covered with cloth and dirt from the backfill pile to protect them until next week.       In addition to the burials, we took several photos of the trench itself. Points of interest include a large, circular area of soft earth in the western part of the trench (L3001), several large cobbles/flagstones (2 of which are upright), and an arc-shaped stain or area of lighter earth at the trench's eastern end. The workmen refer to this as a duvar (wall), though this has yet to be established. No loci will be assigned to any of these features until they are exposed in profile as well as plan view.     ,~: A-3-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 3/Locus 3000,"210,2001-07-12," C-4-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4/Locus 4001,","   July 12, 2001      We are still continuing that surface like place and 2 workers are digging on top of the L4023 they found a piece of sand stone like thing there. I am taking the rocks floating around there. After finding the rocks under the L4019 I may start taking out the soil and start articulating L4020.   In the Southeast side of the trench may be there is a lighter colored area with two lines. We saw a slight color change there but we don't know. I am digging the West part of the trench today.   We started to articulate the oven like feature L4020. I don't think the SW1/4 surface exists. It should be only fill.   Around the oven on the East side there may be a mud brick.   There are some rocks at the East side of L4021 which seem to be the continuation of L4022 and L4015. So I will take the baulk off between them.   Also there is some soft stuff at the SW 1/4 probably a pit.   The small finds until now have come from the surface search which is a small ball and from L4019 a broken fish net weight.     ,~: C-4-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4/Locus 4001,"211,2001-07-12," C-2-2001-07-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2050,","   July 12, 2001   Dartum used in AM 93.678; 1.54m above datum   Worker : Õó_ÑÐmer GuneÕô   Reopened L2052 to remove rest of dense soil layer which yesterday yielded numerous slag-type (?) bits. Huge hard chunks pop off a well-defined layer (lighter colored) below. Few small charcoal bits noted but no charcoal flecks throughout. Small slag bits fewer. Many animal burrows throughout layer. And these are collected separately and discarded. BP states that these hard chunks were interpreted last year as mudbricks and were thought to be part of wall with stones immediately to south (L2046).

This locus perhaps contains a lot of last year's collapse from where L1051 and L1050 were dug. We started to see burnt red and black dirt on the    East side so I stopped moving in that direction. We also dug out the rest of the ash of KT1489 as new locus L1062. I dug both of these soft parts separately in order to prevent the harder dirt around from later contaminating them. The ashy L1062 continue south along L1061.   I opened L1061 as the long pile of pottery and rock chunks. They seem to have fallen all together. There is a line - maybe fill for a wall or something.   We started digging the North section after taking the small find donut which is most likely part of this trash pile - it was re-used. We took some soil from the north.

Most of the effort during the week was focused on understanding the central wall feature (L2016, 2025, 2028). Some time was spent trying to link it with the cobble jumble in the NE corner (L2020, 2026) by the latter's excavation and the excavation of the area between them (L2024). No link, other than the cobbles being of similar size and a loose ability to line the two features up with one another along the E edge, whether the two are actually related is unclear. L2020, 2026 may be more disturbed by virtue of it being further down slope and having less topsoil/fill protection. There are two clear layers to the central feature, L2016 and L2028, as determined by flat-lying pottery. No such clarity in the jumble.   Starting from L2025 edges are clearly visible on the E, W and S, edged by mudbrick along the S and W. There also appears to be a hollow below the surface (L2028), but its cause is undetermined, though it does not look like an animal burrow. Maybe a burial or architectural anomaly... On a side note, a small sounding was done in the new merged trench D5, along the E face of the feature (L5006) which indicates there are no further courses to the major stones in the central feature.     ,~: D-2-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2,"217,2001-07-12," A-4-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4,","   July 12, 2001   Week 2 Summary      Laid out a 2x6m trench heading north out of A1. At this point, we have removed approximately 40cm of fill from the trench and exposed one new locus (4001). This locus is currently a circular pile of rock and ceramic about a meter north of the A1/A4 boundary. An additional 20cm of material has been removed from the southernmost 50cm of the trench in order to cut through A4 in profile, which we should do next week. Another point of note has been the removal of several pieces of sand conglomerate which Johnathan Schnereger believes to be slag from metal working. The presence of this material in the upper 20 cm of surface fill is unusual. Finally, a great deal of animal bone has continued to come up in the southern 1m of the trench. We want to see if this is in any way associated with L4001, or with something else. We have not encountered any human burials (the object of the test trench), but no part of the trench has yet reached the level at which most of the human remains were found in A1.     ,~: A-4-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4,"218,2001-07-12," C-3-2001-07-012-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3,","   Week 2 Summary   July 12, 2001   This week we articulated the area looking for surfaces and features. We found 2 more ovens L3008 and L3006, a slag pit L3007 a wall L3005 and a work surface L3010. One of the ovens L3008 seems to be connected to the lag pit L3007 in the eastern side of the area and where the wall L3005 in the south eastern area abuts the work surface L3010 there is a large slag chunk The work area is defined by many animal bones ant pottery fragments. What looks to be happening in the area is a series of work spaces separated by doors. Doors are indicated by door posts found near both L3008 and L3010. The work areas seem to have ovens that could be producing metal. The reason I think this is because each door post is within a meter and a half of large slag deposits. This is similar to what is seen in area C4, a door post near a slag pit and some sort of divider/wall next to that.

Trench is 2x6m. The trench is stepped, highest in the west, deepest in the east. It has been stepped in order to establish profiles for points of interest within the trench, including several circular areas of softer sediments (two of which are now known to contain what appear to be the remains of human crania) and an arch-shaped stain of lighter sediments the workers think may be a wall. The next step is to expand the trench to the north a bit and test/exhume the exposed bodies.

We found several thin layers of casual, hard to define, work surfaces. The excavation followed different layers ranging from a different elevation of 2-4 centimeters. The excavation of this area was difficult for a few different reasons. First, the surfaces were on a slope and second, there were many thin layers. At the moment the workmen have uncovered several different surfaces within the area in close proximity on top of one another. Each workman found his own surface and went with it...so now we have many surfaces that have been cut through.   We dug the area of L3009 today. It was possibly a pit, but it was pedestaled during excavation. We did not realize the possibility that it was a pit until after the rocks had been articulated. When digging the pit we found material that could be slag or possibly river conglomerate. We are taking a sample of the material that is in KT bag #3085 to compare it to other river conglomerate and hopefully determine its material make-up. While digging the pit we uncovered a metal piece that is in KT bag #3084. While digging L3009 we discovered that the dirt was loose and felt like topsoil. This could be due to the existence of numerous animal burrows found directly beneath the rocks.   After this we closed L3002 which is in the eastern half of the trench 4.5 m from the east baulk and running all 9 m North from the south baulk. We opened L3012 because there seems to be a surface underneath L3002. This is where the bottom of the oven L3008 and where the door post is. We decided that we would try to cut through the locus down to the lowest level on this side which is 10 cm. below the current level. We decided to cut through this. It would be a quick troweling so that we could catch on surfaces that are potentially between the current surface and the target surface. While troweling the first meter, we came across several flat lying pottery pieces that seem to go together. Also, we uncovered a 20-25 cm. flat squarish stone that has an indent in it that looks to be man-made aprox. 1.5 cm from the south baulk and 3 m from the east baulk. We also uncovered some smaller rocks 10 cm that lie in a line which could be a wall or something.

L5011 was removed (which covered from the west baulk-hugging mudbrick feature L5008 to the east baulk of the southern portion of the trench) Underneath was a surface (L5027) which was also found at the bottom of sounding L5009 (it includes that area). The surface was discernible as the mudbrick collapse which covered it (possibly from L5008 or the wall feature of L5004, 5005, 5012, 5014) came off flatly from the surface (but there were not bricks, I swear!). The new surface covers the entire southern half, save an apparent pit (L5024) along the E baulk and an area of soft brown soil (though different from the pit) (L5023) in the SE corner. The surface (L5027) is somewhat ashy. A plaster surface also appeared (L5026) along the mid-trench wall feature, south-side, , but it's rather patchy (and very similar to D2-L2022, which was on the other side of the wall.   L5013 continues to be vexing as it seems different from its N and S abutting loci (L5022 and 5027) yet also different from the mudbrick wall feature to its W (L5012, 5014).   L5022 (E portion, northern half), was excavated to the level of the sounding L5006. Area still seems to be fill.   The rock jumble in the NE corner (L5020) continues deeper (it was excavated to the same level of L5022) and yielded an astounding amount of pottery and small finds, possibly even a pair of weights (KTs 5071 and 5073).

We began the day by finishing up the job of straightening the baulks that had been worked on sporadically the last couple of days. While not a demanding job, it was necessary to straighten the baulks so that we could better view the strata. After straightening the baulks and sweeping away all of the baulk dirt, we were finally ready to begin digging. We took some photos to show the trench as it begins, and then the digging began. Before we began to dig though we took our elevations and then measured the new trench length and width. The trench has grown from our baulk straightening to the size of 4.56 meters N/S and 4.18 E/W.    Well, we first defined the loci that we will be dealing with. We split the south half of the trench into two equal halves, since we know that both of these loci have burials very close to the surface. The north half of the trench we kept as one complete locus (L1018). The southwest locus was given the number L1019 and the southeast locus was named L1020. The goal is to remove all of the dirt that has accumulated over the past 11 months that the trench has been exposed to the elements.

We want to make the earth around them level with the burial areas. We did not finish the cleaning of these fill areas, but we are making progress.

The excavated area of F6 is 2X4m, although we may need to extend the trench down the hill as necessary.       We intended to excavate the trench in two 2m steps but the workman misunderstood and excavated 3 steps of varying sizes: 1m, 1.20m and 1.80. We decided to work with these steps but to return to 2 steps as soon as possible.      L6000 is topsoil in the uphill/Northern 2.20m of the trench.

We dug N 3.5 m from the south baulk bringing that area down to L3013. The soil had some small nuggets, at largest 1 cm, of plaster that were eroded from the top of the hill. The soil was composed largely of loose dirt, except for a few exceptions which had a harder texture and were most likely mud-brick fragments. The soil also contained a couple oven fragments. As the surface L3013 was revealed, a few objects worthy of note appeared. There were some rocks, apparently 10 cm. in diameter in a row that was 20-30 cm. in length. Also, 2 grindstones with divots were found. They remain in situ as well as some other stones that may have been used as the mortar.

Digging continued in L3010. This area consisted mainly of animal bones that were scattered throughout the South West corner. We found some animal bones that were thought to be of a sheep or goat that were articulated. The initial analysis revealed one articulated radius-ulna (or it's animal equivalent) and a humerus. There was also an articulated hoof all in the same vicinity. There were bones that fit together to re-create a cow jaw bone, as well as many other small pieces of varying types of bones from different animals. The bones were gathered into 2 separate KT bags. One was for bones that were collected for further analysis (KT#3100) and a general bone bag for the locus (KT #3099). Further excavation will definitely reveal more bones that are visible from the surface.    The final area that we worked in today was L3001. We expanded L3011 North to the North Baulk.

The last layer, like the one above it (L5015) contained hefty portions of pottery and lithics, but no bones of any sort.

Its relation, or rather, lack thereof, was also cleared up with the NE rock jumble (L5020). Whereas the rock jumble continues to ... jumble ... the feature is gone.

We see two layers of cobbles that we cut through , below which is mudbrick material. This section of the trench is probably also occupational debris, but I think it may be something more significant than subtopsoil.      We had the workmen move subtopsoil at the 17m peg as L2064. We named a new locus, because we are not convinced that the material at the 17m peg is deep enough below topsoil to be the same as the material of L2060 at the 11m peg. Maybe they are equal--we'll decide later. This 1m x 2m section had some insect houses shaped like dirt eggs. We tossed these on the trash pile.      While the workmen moved L2064, Baris and I began peeling back L2059 to the east of L2054-probe. We stopped where the defined bricks of L2042 begin in the east of L2059 and moved back southwards, even with the south edge of L2054. We found the top of the burn layer which is visible in the probe-cut and named it new locus 2065. We took a sample of the charcoal material and left 2065 in place for now. We peeled back L2059 all the way to the east baulk but left 2042 in place. In doing so we found an indentation in L2065 created by the placement of a vessel (the rounded base supported in an earthen lens). The vessel itself is not present, but the \shadow\ of it is very apparent; the soil is welled up and compacted in a lens shape about 23cm across. A second, but now as well preserved pothole/lens is situated to the east of the first pothole/lens.       After breakfast and a tour of areas C and trench A-1, we had the workmen move 1m x 2m of L2064-subtopsoil at the 19m peg.      Genghis came to help us with L2065 and 2059. We measured out another mini-trench to the south edge of L2054, about 70cm wide and carved backL2059 looking for the dimensions of L2065. The blackest of black of 2065 extends south but the color of the burnt material becomes more brown the further away from that pothole/lens we go. Genghis left us and we continued peeling back L2059 to the south and east of L2054-probe toward the east baulk of the trench. The soil south of the darkest of dark burn area of 2065 is very hard packed mudbrick material.       As an aside, Genghis said that in Coltepe these days, mudbrick homes have plaster on both the inside and outside faces of the walls, but in earlier times in Coltepe, they only plastered the inside of the wall. He also said that every year it is necessary to renew the plaster on \modern\ mudbrick homes; thus the plaster gets very thick over time in some places along the walls. He said that Coltepe gets the white clay for making plaster from a particular spot about 10km to the east and a different spot also about 10km to the east.      Now to discuss the relationships between all this stuff coming up in this section of the trench. The white plaster of L2061 is continuous with the white plaster on wall L2056. Thus the surface L2061 is bonded to L2056. The surface plaster L2061 abuts the plaster line on the north side of L2042 that meets the west baulk, so we believe this indicates that whatever is on the north side of this plaster line is contemporary with and bonded to L2061. We will eventually dig through the east-west oriented plaster line just mentioned in order to see what is north of L2042 and how that relates to the system to the south.       The thicker brick of L2062 (red brick with charcoal bits) abuts L2063--which we can see in the section created by L2054; 2063 and 2062 must be separate entities. This hypothesis is supported by the plan view from which we can now see (having peeled back L2059 to the north of L2054) that 2063 flanks 2062 on the west and south sides of L2062. We think that L2063 may even be a brick layer of old-L2042 wall, since the brick above L2063 was a greyish brown and L2063 is reddish brown, just like the brick layers in other parts of A-2 (especially L2034 very close by).       We believe that the burn level L2065 peters out after passing the 2nd pothole/lens (near the east baulk). The color of this soil becomes more brownish than blackish and the texture/ composition becomes harder and less easy to \flick\ off with the trowel point, as we could do when removing 2059 closer to the east edge of L2054-probe. We do not yet know how the cobbles in the base of L2054 relate to the walls, but will hopefully peel back these layers this week.      ,~: A-2-2001-07-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,"243,2001-07-16," C-2-2001-07-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2055,","   July 16, 2001   Datum used in AM SW corner trench C4; 1.39m above datum   Worker : Apo GuneÕô; Erol   Army visited the site and the soldiers were there for most of the second half of the day _ÑÐ distracted all area C workers with questions, chatter, etc. Work slowed.

Thus the primary purpose of today_Ñés work was to clear away the remaining material left from fill/erosion. Started above the rocks in the southwest quarter of the trench to identify the relationship between the areas north and south of it. . I now think the area to the south of the rocks in the SW qtr is a pit bounded by river conglomerate-like rocks and that these two sides are distinct areas. (The river rocks and pit association is interesting!). Fill material in south and east parts of trench will be removed as L2055. The locus to clear the remaining erosion fill extends east and north between L2056 and L2052. The fill seems to slope upward toward SE corner where some worked stones were found. This could eventually represent a work surface?      In the NW half of trench is a sparsely populated possible surface or at least a definable level space.       Excavation of the irregular pit-like structure filled with soft ashy dirt began as L2056. About 5-10 cm from its top a plaster layer was encountered. Katie and Rob both had a go at it and it is continuing to the north from the southern end of the pit. May run under the denser soil to the west of the pit but not clear yet.

So after a good cleaning we sprayed the entire square to try and find the bottom of the feature, which appeared to be in a surface visible in the W section. The surface was pebble on the southern side of the trench and ashy and burnt/compacted soil on the other side. So the feature (which was communally grouped to create L5031, as it was all the same feature and the earlier designations had to do with the height at which they had been made clear) was cut to this level. Of course, there were problems. It looks like the pebble surface we were using for a guide is cut by a pit on the southern side of the wall/feature and can't be picked up within it whereas on the northern side the guide surface clearly cut into the mudbrick. I'm no longer certain the two surfaces are in fact the same. Though we were not able to pick up the ashy (northern guide) surface as we moved down, we were able to pick it up in the section immediately after we cut it and stop digging there to examine the feature.   The feature beneath the surface does not appear to be mudbrick, persay, but rather a more casual mud blob building type still used in modern villages (the modern note from worker Mehmet). Though there are still layers and the area is harder than standard soil, it makes picking out the feature as other than tougher soil very difficult, which is compounded by the fact that area is riddled with roots and much of the W section in that area is full of animal burrows making it useless for much more than picking out the ashy surface as mentioned above. At this point I have no idea whether the wall above the ashy surface (which seemed more like organized mudbrick) and that below are concurrent or whether the higher was just built atop the lower and at some later point.   Some area of the fill beneath the now departed N-central rock feature (L5025) was dug as L5030. The area features soft, brown soil and assorted pottery and animal bones. For a moment there were enough large animal bones that I took a few minutes to articulate them myself in case there was a bone level or burial, but such is not the case. It does look, however, like a faint pebble surface may be appearing.     ,~: D-5-2001-07-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5008,"245,2001-07-16," A-3-2001-07-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 3/Locus 3000,","   July 16, 2001      Forgot to add yesterday that all three of the soft spots adjacent to (east of) the arc-shaped clay feature turned out to be nothing.      &lt; See sketch from  hard copy&gt;      Workers also found a piece of sand conglomerate near the clay feature. Sand grains, quartz crystals, and what looked like a piece of iron pyrite (gold color) were clearly visible in it using a hand lens.

There had been a discrepancy from the high and low elevations the previous day (7/15/2001) due to a mis-calculation of the datum. We spent the morning trying to correct this problem. We also continued digging in L3012 and we found the surface L3013. The workmen continued uncovering the surface and exposing more area, but nothing else of significance was found in that locus. The other area we worked in was L3010. This locus has characteristically been composed of pot sherds and animal bones. Further digging exposed more bones, but more articulation will be necessary before a possible identification. While digging in L3010 there was a small area in which the fill was a different texture and color. It was a rich, reddish-brown and was accompanied with a few remnants of oven pieces (KT#3125) We did not make it a separate locus because the area uncovered so far is so small and may just be an anomaly. It will be interesting to see what the implications of this (if there are any) will be. Tomorrow we will continue digging in the areas of L3012/L3013 and L3010.

In contrast, L6003, opened today in the middle 1.20m step, contains both loose silt loam and mudbrick debris in equal quantities. We excavated the western half of L6003 about halfway to the base of L6002.      L6002 and 6001 are now closed because we are beneath topsoil.

It's a mystery.   I extended the area taken down in L 4037 to try and get a better line on the wall by having a good section.   I also took down the plateaued pebbles in L 4040 and took the rest of the soft areas down so they were level. When sectioned the pebbles didn't have anything under them. They must had been deposited by wind or water. Water is a good guess since the soil was silty and the pebbles were rounded like river pebbles.   A nice obsidian blade came up in the oven L 4023. I made it a small find and gave it KT 4235. It's only 3.5 cm long and 1.5 cm wide, but it has a nice edge. I got an elevation on it and plotted it in.   Well, the oven triumphs again. Maybe. The soil is a little more brown today, but as we dug some large bones came up. One is a horn. It is about 15 cm below KT 4225 the mudbrick thing, and only about 30 cm away. Initially I thought it may be associated with the figure. The horn may have been inserted into the hole on one side. However, it turned out to be a crania of probably a goat and its horns. There is also a jaw bone next to it with some hoof pieces. We came up with some hoof bones digging earlier in the day.   As we were digging some plaster started to come up. I took a sample of it KT 4237. As soon as the east half of the oven L4023 is level we'll push across and down in the west half and see if we can follow the plaster. It may be the floor of the oven.   As we removed the large bones in L 4023 we found another large half of a jaw in the oven wall behind the jaw and hoof. We left it in, but it presents a problem. It is at least 5 cm in the oven wall. This could mean we need to shave back the oven walls further because we have not actually reached them or we have already dug through the bottom of the oven so this jaw is not in the oven wall, but under it. Hopefully we just hit the bottom now with this plaster level that's appearing.   We need to take down L 4037 deeper instead of extending it. I'll do that tomorrow and work on tracing lines in L 4040 to see if the wall is there.     ,~: F-4-2001-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4023,"250,2001-07-17," C-3-2001-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3001,","   July 17, 2001   Today we started by cleaning the entire trench. This helped us see 2 mudbrick walls in the NW part of the trench. The first is an arc which starts in the center baulk that runs N-S down the entire center of the trench 4.5 m W from the E baulk. The wall starts 2.70 m S from the N baulk, curves N reaching at closest 2.30 m S of the N baulk and finishing its arc 2.75 m S of the N baulk and 1.25 m E of the W baulk. This is L3016. The second is a straight wall which comes E from the W baulk and maybe abuts or ends at the west end of the arc L3016. This is L3017. I need to clean a couple of centimeters of dirt of the top of L3017 to see if it continues past the west most part of the arc L3016.    Next, today we dug further in L3010 to try to get through the surface. I think that we have peeled most of it off. It seems to be a more solid surface underneath but that requires more investigation. We also identified an ash layer L3014, east of oven L3003 that extends East to the SE baulk. We started digging there and we found that it goes down and is probably a pit. There is a presence of pinkish-whitish-yellowish plaster Munselled at 2.5Y 8/3 appearing in the pit.    Last we identified a stone half circle L3015 coming out of the East baulk 2.4 meters North of the South baulk. It is either in or on L3013. The cobble surface of L3013 is not present inside the surface. The rock jumble that is present inside L3013 may be a collapse of whatever structure that L3015 is. The cobble surface does not seem to continue north of L3015. Also, there may be a soil change at that point. We will have to investigate further.   Finally, we may have identified a couple of pits in the North part of L3011. The first of the maybe pits is in the Northwest corner of L3011. The dirt is a little different and I will try to define a pit tomorrow. The second is a small jumble of small stones and pottery. Its soil is loose, that may be because of the abundance of animal burrows in it. The way I will find out if it is, is by scraping away from the stones and pottery to see if a surface appears. If not, I will treat it as a pit. It is located 20 centimeters South of the North Baulk and 2.5 meters east of the West baulk.      ,~: C-3-2001-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3001,"251,2001-07-17," F-1-2001-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1018,","   July 17, 2001      My s have always been pretty long, but today is not going to be a verbose entry because work that took a lot of time didn't really lead to anything too interesting to write about. We dug down in L1018 about five centimeters on the whole area. It appears we may hit something cool soon, but nothing yet. We leveled the Loci around L1021, the burial, looking for more cool pots or rocks. We found nothing as we took down L1024. L1024 was given a separate locus because of its location on the other side of the burial. The soil on it this day was not as soft as the burial locus, but it was softer than the other soil in the trench. This area did give a large pot last year, so we think there may be some good stuff in this locus. Other than assorted pottery sherds and lithics the day was not too exciting. I think I am going to make L1020 and L1022 into two Loci, L1025 and L1026, one within the hypothesized oven and one out of the oven. The burial should be taken out by bone guys this afternoon. Then we can finally get down beneath it and see what is up (or down, whatever the case may be). That's all for today. Bradley came and spidered the burial. Dawnell found some cool bull horn in the oven in F4. Go Dawnell!!!   On this day we also began a new locus, L1028. We had begun the locus L1022, which this locus is underneath, for the purpose of finding the burial in the southeast of the trench. Since it now appears that this burial is underneath the baulk, we changed back to a new locus.

Every possibility that the pit was not cultural in origin.       Now left with 5 burials (Locus 3002, 3006, 3007, 3008).

Also removed two blocks of earth which looked like they may have been mud brick walls/architecture.

However, this new locus seems to be expanding the realization that this is probably natural deposit. The soil is a Brownish/Yellow and is very sandy with rocks and pebbles, which leads us to believe that it may be part of a greater flood plane from the Tigris.

He went down another 5 cm. No artifacts came out of the soil, but we are starting to get a hood section on L 4041. Unfortunately it is looking less wall like.   I took some pictures of the jaw bone in L 4023. Then I took it out as KT 4241. The wall that it was in and the surrounding areas do look like they need to be scraped back more.

We opened a 10x10 directly west of what was F-2 last year. The reasoning behind this trench is linked to the excavation of a cobbled surface found 50 cm. below the modern surface. in F-2 The cobbled surface in F-2 appeared to extend West and so we will be looking for this surface during the initial stages of our excavation. We opened F-7 with 2 loci-7000 and 7001. The reasoning behind this is the presence of a plow zone that covers over half of the trench. This area has undulating elevations that differ inasmuch as 15 cm from the top of a row to the adjacent rift. It is clear that this area has been more recently disturbed than L7001 which is relatively flat and only has a difference of 1 cm. in elevation between the northwest and southwest corner. We are in the midst of removing topsoil and evening out the trench in L7000. The soil from this locus was Munselled at 10YR 5/3 and is silt loam that is dry and loose. We removed up to 12 cm of dirt from the majority of L7000.

F1 had been dug last year, and this year has provided us with some interesting information and direction. After removing the topsoil we found several interesting items which we will do this week, as well as some areas which we can focus on next week.    The majority of our time in the trench this week focused on the burial in the southwest area of the trench, L1021. We were able to almost completely excavate the burial, and we would have excavated the entire burial except for the confusion of how the burial was laying. The large bones which were part of the burial were given KT1107 and KT 1106. In addition there are some smaller bone fragments which would be related to the burial if they are from L1021. Two incredible small finds, probably related to the burial, were also found this week. Earlier in the week we found a small pot, 2cm by 3cm, which we gave KT 1087. This pot was complete and unbroken. Just today, July 19, we found a small juglet which appeared to be nestled in the arms of the burial. It was very impressive. We gave this juglet KT 1118. Also maybe related to the burial is KT1117, a large pot smash found about 20 cm away. The burial excavation appears to be almost complete, and next week we will finish the burial and probably close the locus.   Other areas of the trench have not been as fruitful, but they are ripe with possibilities. The northern half of the trench, L1026 and L1027, appear to be developing quite nicely. It appears that the loci had a small thin crust over the top of them, which may have been a surface, or which may have been a destruction layer over a surface. We found only a very small amount of artifacts in these two loci, nothing of any note, and we believe that we may just now be hitting on a surface. We will work on this in the week to come, to push down and see what is there.   Probably most intriguing for the future of the trench are what appear to be two parallel ovens, which seem to be parallel in L1025 and which may move into other loci when the actual oven is revealed. Our purpose next week will be to push down to this oven level in other areas of the trench and hopefully find out where we can go with these ovens.    These areas give us much to do in the weeks to come, and hopefully we can have a fruitful time coming straight down on the fantastic discoveries that F4 has found just meters to the side and meters below us.     ,~: F-1-2001-07-19-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,"270,2001-07-19," C-4-2001-07-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4/Locus 4001,","   July 19, 2001      We sweeped the part that we were working yesterday then we started to continue at that part, we are approaching to the wall like feature L4030. Then we took L4020, the rocks over the oven.   We reached the wall in the South part of the L4029 probe east. It is definitely different and quite solid for 15cm down at least. Our probe hit the middle of the connection between L4003 and 4030. It appears that L4003 is cut out of the L4030 as there is mostly crumbled dirt around L4003. Just South of L4003 the soil is quite hard, and deep. The soft soil on the West just fell off. There seems to be rocks and pottery in the North and South walls of our probe at the same elevations. We decided to try to find surface by heading South at an elevation about 10cm above our probe or 15 cm below the top of L4030. We are scraping carefully.   Some more potential slag came up on the North side of L4015 in the same place as some potential slag we bagged yesterday. We are also finding plenty of rocks in the line which is slightly below L4015 heading North.   In L4031 we started to take the dirt off the oven, it seems to be well preserved and goes quite deep. There are a lot of oven pieces inside of the oven. It seems that it collapsed inside. And also we found a rock inside around that we left a section to see the stratigraphy. We took two bags of soil samples and at the bottom there is that more reddish dirt. The walls seem to be quite complete except a little part in the North side.   The reddish dirt is concentrated at the N 1/2 of the oven. Also there is blackish dirt at the South side.   We found a white piece which looks like pottery. But it is made up of lime. So we gave a KT # to that (KT # 4152) in L4029 almost touching to L4030.   We might see another wall looking like L4030 in the NE 1/4 of the trench.     ,~: C-4-2001-07-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4/Locus 4001,"271,2001-07-19," C-3-2001-07-019-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,","   Week 3    ending July 19, 2001      This week we took out the pit L3008 and the pit L3007 in the south eastern area of the trench and found that, A they are most likely not related to each other, and B L3007 might not have been a pit. So I_Ñém not really sure what was going on there. Next we started taking off the surface that the oven and \pit\ were on. We found underneath it a well preserved cobble surface L3013 with large stones in it. We found also a stone circle coming out of the baulk at the northern border of the cobble surface. Also the stones in the cobble surface seem to form a corner. On the cobble surface there are a couple of stones with divits in them, either grind stones or door posts. This surface also abuts the oven L3003 in the south baulk. North of the cobble surface the soil changes to a compact soil with no cobbles. I'm not sure but the cobbles don't seem to continue west past the last stones about 2.5-3 m W of the east baulk. This could mean that the stones enclosed an area that is in the baulk that has a cobble surface and outside was a different area. The cobble surface could be an outside surface or work surface because it has animal bone and pottery sherds on it. The other side could be an inside or well cleaned surface because it is nicely compact with no abundance of pottery of animal bones. Further excavation will help me see what is going on here.   In the west side of the trench we dug the work surface 3010, which is in the south west corner, and found that the wall running south into it does not run underneath it. I won't know what the walls association with the work surface is until I dig further east from the work surface. In the north west part of the trench I found two mud brick walls. One, L3017, comes out of the west baulk 2.75 m south of the north baulk and abuts the other, L3016, which was about 40 cm north and back ending in the mid trench baulk. I found these at the end of the week so I have not had time to investigate their relation to the rest of the trench. Next week I will be able to find out how the loci in the western half relate to one another and I will go down further in the eastern half.      ,~: C-3-2001-07-019-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,"272,2001-07-19," C-2-2001-07-019-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,","   Weekly Summary for week ending July 19, 2001 (Thurs)      The general goals for excavation in C2 were (1) to define the levels and loci from last year, (2) to reveal the current stratigraphy of the trench with a special focus on defining coordinated architecture and surfaces, and (3) to create documentation of the upper layers so that earlier levels can subsequently be explored.       The goal of this trench generally was to document the Early Iron Age to pre-Iron Age transitional period. Presently I have not read any pottery from C2 but I have looked at material coming form the trench itself and, in the case of the pit (?) in the SE corner, it looks Iron Age (nipple base; corrugated bowl). So therefore, a goal of pottery reading next week is to determine to what extent the trench is yielding IA overall versus in this pit only. Presently the BP pottery reading places the current trench levels in the pre Iron Age.       The levels excavated last year have finally been surpassed this week after much confusion over levels _ÑÐ partly due to an incorrectly heard datum height and partly due to differences in the levels used this year and last year. Also _ÑÐ a desirable thing for next year _ÑÐ plastic the trenches somehow for easier opening.       Thus far we have defined two superimposed wall structures, each of which seems to include a corner and some collapse and the larger of the two (the one on the north and west) may be associated with a surface but this connection is not yet clear. A more definite feature of this trench is the concentration of fire-related features on the east side rather than the west side. Perhaps this indicates an inside (west) vs outside (east) relationship. The architectural remnants in this trench indicate both mudbrick and stone architecture was in use. No fully in situ contexts have been found in this year_Ñés chopped up top levels but the major wall on the west half of the trench may contain and then seal below it better contexts. Metallic production remnants continue to appear in this trench.      The material removed in the east half of the trench includes fill and water laid surfaces (ancient) and I wonder whether this may not be an indication of some seasonal use of the    site or that it is simply an outside area (non-surface so far).                    ,~: C-2-2001-07-019-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,"273,2001-07-19," F-4-2001-07-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4023,","   July 19, 2001      We took down the west half of the oven L 4023 looking for virgin soil or what may be a floor. There was a lot of white plasterish stuff in the east half. It turns out that that is the virgin soil cut at an angle so the white pebbles normally present look more spread out. As we were digging the west half down level with the rest of the locus we found a horn, perhaps a new animal or associated with the animals we dug up in the last two days. We also found a gray charcoal area from which I took a sample KT 4253. We also found another one of those large rounded end rocks that we have hypothesized may be digging spades. It is KT 4254. We also worked on scraping the oven walls for a while. The floor/bottom of the oven as well as under the walls is at virgin soil so I closed the locus of L 4023. I opened a new locus there L 4042 which I will excavate another 10-20 cm just to ensure that it is really virgin soil.   I took pictures of L 4041 which doesn't so much seem to be a wall as not be a wall at all. There's a huge sherd sticking out of the side and for all my scraping I can't find lines on the top and there are no courses on the sides. I'll whack it down after the day off.   Took down a portion of L 4038. Found what could be a hammer stone in KT 4258.

Excavations have turned up a total of 7 burials and two other features -- an arc-shaped area of hardened, whitish clay and associated \fill\ The fill has been defined as the material falling within the area of the arc. This fill has been left unsampled in order to protect a burial (3006) found just west of the area.      Exposure of several areas of softer dirt, including the pit-shaped depression identified as locus 3001, has revealed nothing. Roots and rootlets are commonplace and rodent activity also a possibility. The remains of a small rodent were found in-situ near one of the skeletons in A1.      The major features of interest remain the burials themselves. 3002, 3003, 3006, 3008, and 3009 all appear to be juveniles based on their current limited exposure. All were exposed cranial caps which have been partially destroyed by shovels. L3007 and L3010 look to be larger individuals, either adults or older juveniles. These are represented by long bones of the arm (humerus, radius, ulna).      As a general rule, the larger/older individuals all appear to be interred deeper in the ground. L3009 is found approximately 75cm down much like the individuals in A1. L3007 is the only adult found higher up (about 50cm below ground). All other individuals from this elevation or higher has been a juvenile (general impression).

(L4022) Also we decided that rocks coming to the false W baulk from N is another locus because they were forming a line and quite a big grouping there. (L2023) Then we cut the baulk between NE and SE 1/4 of the trench to see the continuation of the rock grouping there and it was really continuing so that is L 4024. Then we decided that the rock grouping under the L4018 is also different so it is L4025.    And the surface next to L4021 is another surface with pottery sitting on it that has a locus # 4026. L4027 is the oven itself under the L4004 feature. But we couldn_Ñét find the walls very much.

I confirmed we have virgin soil in the corner next to the oven in locus L 4036 and it seems to be spreading into L 4037. The oven L 4023 is finally closed and is also pulling up virgin soil.   One of the most important things I did this week was redefine the loci. Unfortunately all this meant in the long run was that I had a new design on my day plan. None of the features are turning out as expected. The \wall\ has a nice fat potsherd sticking straight out of it and no brick lines or courses that I can discern. The whole trench just seems like different kinds of fill with a pit or two cutting it.   I still need to work on scraping for a surface in L 4039 and see if it may extend to L 4038. I keep hoping that we might find one since we found a lovely potsmash KT 4246 half in the baulk in the loci L 4038. I hope it's sitting on a surface and perhaps we can push it over and articulate it with the oven L 4023.   Most of the week was spent finishing the oven and looking for virgin soil in the corner in L 4036. We did push down in the riverside half of the trench, but it is all garbage fill.

We have clearly reached two separate surfaces in the N and S (L5034 and L5027). Both appear to be one the same orientation, with their northern walls being in a NW-SE orientation. L5027 also has its W wall intact (L5008) which has a perfectly preserved seam with the surface in places.   The main question in my mind is whether the two areas, which I believe area domestic dwellings, are contemporary. Though the S surface is about 30 cm higher, the N surface is also slightly downslope. Currently I'm leaning towards them being slightly (relatively speaking) different in time period, as it looks like a surface from the S area may overlay the N surface.   Many ovens have appeared lately in N area, one which appears to be contemporary with the N-surface (L5033) and another on a more ambiguously associated surface (surface: L5028, oven: 5036). I think with a little careful digging we may be able to clarify the S surface and maybe the N surface by mid-next week. The central mudbrick wall L5031 still needs to be articulated as it had many rebuildings and we need to figure out which are associated with the surfaces. Also of interest is an emerging possible curved mudbrick wall abutting the E edge of the N surface.     ,~: D-5-2001-07-019-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"279,2001-07-19," C-2-2001-07-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2058,","   July 19, 2001      Total station levels taken today.

Locus 2006 was started due to our desire to remain consistent in our 20-25 cm arbitrary levels. We found some ceramic fragments in this strat. Then, we hit the infamous rock/sand matrix. We, therefore, switched to Locus 1007. We dug through the locus for 33 cm. and called it quits as down came the day. There weren't, of course, any artifacts discovered in this final locus.

It's still the same coarse fill. I also took off the end of L 4041 that connects to the baulk and is at the top of L 4038. We'll scrape and straighten the new section of L 4041 and the baulk, but I still don't think that will make it a wall. If it still looks like slump or fill, the hump is coming down.   Took down L 4038 another 5 cm. I want to see if something is coming up since we're not in virgin soil yet.   Meanwhile the trench is low enough that we can dig in pit L 4034 again. We're taking that down in 5cm increments to try and find the bottom and see if we can hit virgin soil in there as well. Time elapse--no virgin soil, but there were some beautiful large diagnostic sherds. There were some rim fragments and a ring base that was about 5cm across. The locus still isn't closed so we'll dig in it tomorrow.   L 4041 was nothing so we whacked it. The soil of L 4041 was hard on top, but is loamy underneath. As we took the hump down we found a thin white line around 2mm across running roughly where the red line was at an earlier elevation. We're working on tracing this area to see what it connects to and what it may signify. We took down L 4037 another 5 cm to look at the other side of the area by the white line. There was not much there so we traced closer and closer to the line until there is only an area around 4-5 cm wide that is at a higher elevation than the rest of L 4041. The significance of the line may well lie toward the riverside section of the trench than on the high baulk side as we explored today.   Took down half of L 4042 20cm to ensure that we were in virgin soil and the pit doesn't slope toward the center, so it looks finished in the section, but the pit keeps going. It doesn't. The oven is finished and we are definitely in virgin soil. We also scraped the walls and section so we can make sure we have a nice view of when the oven, L 4023, ended because I think we may have pushed past it a little before we closed the locus.   The section of L 4038 pulled up harder earth.

After we completed this work, one area stood out due to a cluster of rocks around the southern baulk. As a result we opened locus #7002.      Locus 7002 is located 2.5 meters East of the West baulk on the southern side of the trench. The cluster of rocks are accompanied by some pottery sherds and at least one bone. This area seems as though it could be a possible surface. The stones range in size from 10-15 cms. The soil around the rocks greatly resembles the topsoil layer and was Munselled at 10YR 5/2. More excavation is necessary to determine if these characteristics do in fact indicate a surface.      In addition to defining L# 7002, we decided to open a small area in the Northeast corner of the trench to see if we could locate the cobbled surface from F-2. We dug 30 cms. from the current surface before we found large flat lying pottery sherds that may indicate a surface. The locus #7003 was defined in the discovery of cultural activity and the possibility of it being the surface we are looking for. The soil from this surface Munselled at 10YR 5/3. At the moment the locus is a 2x2 cut. We will articulate the actual surface before expanding the locus.      Tomorrow we will continue the detailed excavation of L7002-7003 to see if the characteristics that indicate these surfaces are in fact actual surfaces.      * KT#'s collected in L7000 and L7001 were from the loose dirt left from 7/19/01.     ,~: F-7-2001-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7000,"292,2001-07-21," F-1-2001-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1019,","   July 21, 2001      We began the day by taking measurements and straightening baulks. We took down L1024, the area south of the burial L1021, down about 15-30cm, depending on the position, so that the locus was level with the elevation of the burial. This area revealed nothing of major import, although some pottery was found.    After taking down this area we continued on our articulation of the actual burial L1021. No new artifacts were found during the articulation of the burial, but much progress was made in the preparation of the burials for the bone delegation's second attempt at removal of the burial. Their first removal removed the top level of bones, including the leg bones which were sticking up, and this second attempt should remove all. We also set up spider shots, overhead shots which are level, so we should be ready for the removal of the burial either tonight or tomorrow.   While we worked on the articulation we took down the area east of the burial which is in L1019 about 5 cm. We did this for the purpose of hopefully being able to better see the oven walls of the two ovens that we believe are appearing. One oven takes up the majority of L1025, and the other oven appears to be right next to the oven L1025. This oven has a wall which appears to be at the very edge of L1025, and then it appears to go underneath what for now is L1019. So that is why we went down. We will probably want to go down more tomorrow to better understand the oven area. We believe that both ovens are square shaped, or at the least that one side is flat on each oven.   We ended the day by whacking down 10cm on L1027 again with the purpose of getting down to the level of the oven L1025, so that we can better understand the borders and associated surfaces of this oven.        ,~: F-1-2001-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1019,"293,2001-07-21," D-5-2001-07-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5008,","   July 21, 2001      The trench took some damage over the weekend, seemingly from a problem with some curious people (and birds) disturbing the trench.

Specifically, a turkey seems to have made a nest, though left no eggs, in SE pit L5024.   The plan for the day was to clean up the trench for a schematic drawing and a plan shot, so we took some time to level up and clean surfaces and articulate mudbrick, and finally dig the oven in the southern surface near the western wall L5008, L5040. Unfortunately, neither Mehmet or I were feeling well and I stopped paying attention to him digging it and it got a little out of hand. It wasn't a complete loss, though, as it showed that the surface L5027 was built upon thick, hard fill, possibly more collapsed mudbrick.

Last year I had potentially some corners, now it is all scrambled so I am afraid it collapsed.   I will push down in L1057 which is the fill on top of the potential ashy surface and runs all the way to the West baulk.

We drew onto the top plan the large (25cm) cobblestones in the west portion of the step (60cm wide measured from west baulk). We named these cobbles L 2077 and left them in situ for now. We also measured onto the top plan the north edge of L2063. We took elevations down the hill all the way to the 31m peg, so we can enlist wily workers to whack whenever we want.       We had two workers dig 15cm down through the chewed-up top layer of these top at the 6m peg. We dug this small shaving as subtopsoil L2064 because it is essentially the residual bits of subtopsoil 2002 from last year and we had trampled it so much that it was un-readable as anything besides unspecified fill. We will change locus here once we clean up from this maintenance digging. (This is the top of the step where we see mudbrick bands in the north section directly adjacent to the surface system 2047-2048-2049).      We also began to move L2073-hearth. We measured half of the locus and dug down the western half carefully with a small pick and trowel with the intention of figuring out how the hearth was constructed. After removing the top layer of cobbles (the ones we could see from the top before we began digging) we hit a layer of ashy soil mixed with more of L2062-looking soil (ie, reddish brown hard packed dirt with lots of charcoal inclusions). We could already see the tops of more cobbles poking through this dirt layer, so we removed the soil layer and then removed the layer of cobbles below.    Once we had dug the western portion of L2073 such that its base was level with the base of 2054, we cleaned up and looked at the eastern section. We confirmed that there are two levels of cobbles separated by a thin layer of soil. We removed the eastern portion of L2073 quickly using a big pick to remove most of the cobbles and hard soil fill and then used a small pick to clean out the locus where it meets L2063 and L2078 (new locus to describe the fill (?) below red surface L2063). We took a few carbon samples in the process, hoping to date the hearth. Once the hearth was \leveled\ we took elevations and then troweled to see if we still came up with the same red soil with charred inclusions. We decided to split the locus in half again because we are not sure that we have the base of 2073 yet. We dug down the western portion of the base of 2073 with the hopes of getting a look at the section to figure out where the hearth fill stops. We will start tomorrow by taking a progress photo and taking one elevation where we stopped in the western half.       We also removed L2063 entirely. We used trowels to scoop off the crumbly, hard, dessicated red soil of this surface (or surface preparation?). The soil was full of lots and lots of small pebbles but remarkably few sherds, bones, etc. The soil picked off often times in the same way that mudbricks pick off; i.e., almost always \flat\ on the bottom side and sometimes retained its chunky shape. The red soil of L2063 \sloped\ down at the seam between L2063 and 2072 (i.e., the division was clearly  esident-made\ and not an artifact of our digging tools. We named the soil below L2063 as new locus 2078. We do not yet know what 2078 is, but will perhaps push down in half of this locus since it represents a well-sealed context for any pottery it might produce.      We had two of our workers start working on L2043 topsoil between the 23m and 25m pegs (a new 2 x 2 section down hill). They got part of the way through this task and were called to Area F to help out there, so this step of 2043 will be finished up tomorrow.            ,~: A-2-2001-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,"304,2001-07-22," F-4-2001-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4027,","   July 22, 2001      I started by taking down L 4034 about 5cm deeper. I can see virgin soil in the section of the pit near the oven so I know it's cutting through it, but I still can't find the bottom. The soil is still brown and a silty loamy soil, not the hard, red clay of virgin soil.   I took down part of L 4040 closest to L 4039. I'm trying to see if the white line of L 4041 discovered yesterday has any significance here. The dirt is sill the same soft brown. In fact when looking at it and the section from pit L 4034 it looks like the pit narrowed rapidly and I didn't catch the line. So some of what was excavated as the pit (about 30 cm on the end of the baulk toward the river and L 4040) actually belongs to L 4040.   Basically today we're doing a whole lot of chopping to see if we can hit virgin soil everywhere and close the trench. I've scraped the sections and turned the sprayer on them as well, but I don't see anything. All there is fill with pot sherds in it. In a way it makes sense. The oven is such a monumental feature and the trench is so small there may not be any features in such close proximity to a huge source of heat. We catch a wall in one section, but it never extended into the trench enough to follow it extends toward the baulk and beyond, not the interior of the trench. I keep looking. Perhaps there is a packed earth surface that people were using when they dumped trash into the ovens or one of the other two pits that cut the area.   I took down L 4038 about 10cm. Nothing in the section. Took down L 4040 another 20cm. No end in sight.   Took down L 4039. There was a large sherd that had been sticking up for the last couple of days which I was able to remove after we went down 5cm. It's only a body sherd however.   After all the digging today I'm right back where I started. The little white line is gone, but it didn't connect to anything or do anything. Tomorrow we'll just bash deeper and see if anything good comes up. The half of the trench toward the high baulk and the oven is at virgin soil and finished now.     ,~: F-4-2001-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4027,"305,2001-07-22," F-7-2001-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7000,","   July 22, 2001   Area F   Trench 7   Katie Smith      Today we continued the detailed excavation of L7002 and L7003. Although the cluster of rocks in the southern baulk seemed indicative of a surface. There was nothing else found to support that hypothesis. The soil in that locus was the same as the topsoil layer in L7000 and L7001, so we closed the locus and indicated that it was equal to both L7000 and L7001 in the locus entry sheets.      We also changed the boundaries between L7000 and L7001 to be exactly half of the trench. (See 7/23/2001 dayplan for clarification) We took the elevation down in L7001 10-15 cms. and found another layer of dirt that we are referring to as \sub-topsoil\ . The texture is still grainy like the upper level, but a little finer and it Munselled at 2.5Y 5/3 which is a light olive brown. This new level is now L7004. We found 2 grindstones (KT#'s 7035-7036) and one obsidian blade (KT # 7037) in removing L7001 from L7004. There do not seem to be any outstanding features or surfaces in L7004 as of yet, so tomorrow we will first clean the area and see if we are missing anything. If there is nothing of substance we will take another 10 cms off of the top and continue until we find something substantial that is indicative of cultural activity.       The excavation of L7003 is continuing with a hand trowel. Today we came across a cluster of cobbles measuring from 4-7 cms. that we thought was the surface we were looking for, but unfortunately the cobbles did not continue along a surface, so we will keep looking until we find it and then follow it into L7000...if that is where it continues.

The last two weeks of excavation have revealed what Bradley considers an Early Iron Age wash descending West down the tepe. We hope to catch this period more thoroughly further east up the tepe. Area B has not been excavated since last year when a sealed Early Iron Age surface was found in Trench B1 and a complex mudbrick wall system in B2. this year we hope to get a better context of those surfaces in B1 and B2 by opening a 10 x 10 meter trench which encompasses trench B1. The new trench B4 will have trench B1 as its South West Corner.   We began the day by clearing the brush from the new part of trench B4. I retied my baulk strings during breakfast. We started digging in the North West corner of the trench leaving a .5 meter baulk between trench B1's North Baulk and the rest of trench B4. We will not begin excavation in the former B1 trench till later in the week.   On to the rest of B4....About a meter and a half east of the west baulk we found a large concentration of pottery. South of this area of pottery we also found a concentration of rock which Jonathan calls conglomerate. The rock was given its own KT #4003 and we continued digging. Bradley identified some of the pot sherds as Early Iron Age from the ceramic handle found among the body sherds. We focused on clearing away the fill around the potter pieces and I changed locus from 4000 to 4001. While revealing the pottery in L4001. We continued digging in L4000 south of L4001 but found nothing interesting, but will continue to dig deeper tomorrow. We followed the pottery as far as it extended west and south.

This trench is a 10 meters by 10 meters but we also laid a 5 meter intersect marker from the West corners and North to South. This is due to the fact that the Southeast corner area (actually the whole quadrant) of the trench lies as part of the hill (cliff) descending towards the Tigris River. Part of the trench (10 x 10 m) will encompass part of the cliff whenever it is completely converted to a full 10 x 10 meters.   I got the workers clearing noxious weeds and bushes from the furrowed criss-crossed trench from plowing. These furrows cut the trench from the Northeast to Southwest and appear to have been left unused for several years (5-10 years).   With the trench properly defined and staked (with exception of the Southwest area where the baulk was cut by half and a few centimeters down) workers begin by cutting through top soil and collecting various pieces of pottery to sample for possible mixing due to the plowing. Some of the first pieces found have rims and there is at least one piece from a handle (useful in dating).   We take the trench down about .15 meters all around. All we have is some stumps.

I also scraped west of the oven and a little northwest. I found that the cobble surface does not continue there so I shortened L3013 to 2.5 m west of the east baulk and 3.5 m north of the south baulk. The remainder is L3019 because it is the same as the area north of L3013. I am also reclassifying L3019 as fill rather than a surface because it seems to have no continuity. We are digging through L3024 trying to reach the surface we see in section and slowly expanding it southward in hopes of eventually bringing the entire trench down to the same level.   The other thing we did today was dig further in L3018. We also found that on top of the surface there is a big lump, so far 50-60 cm long and a couple of cm high on top of the surface. There is a line where you can see the lump stop and the surface begin. It feels like cement and I'm wondering if it may be slag. It has the look of something that was originally liquid that solidified on top of the surface.

F8 seeks to possibly locate additional surface layers continuing from the other trenches. The location of the trench in an area that overlooks the river would have been a good choice for looking across the Tigris River as well as adjoining lower valleys. The trench was laid out as 10 by 10 meters trench but I will begin by also laying an intersect to excavate a 5 by 10 meters with the longest axis running from North to South. The reasoning for this lies in the fact that the eastern half of the trench is partially in the cliff going towards the river.   Initial excavation yields and oven L8002 a small layer of rocks L8003 and a 1.75 meter by 1.25 meter hard packed area of unknown origin at this time L8004.

We screened about half of the remaining locus because we were hoping to find more remnants of the intact skeleton. I will have to do my top plan and final elevations tomorrow. We discovered that L6005 cut under L600. We had already predicted this by looking at the already exposed profile on the southern end of L6004.

We big picked to the same level as the previous day and we uncovered two levels of cobbles ranging in size from .30m to .12m with small cobbles on top of larger ones. One of these cobbles is a small piece of basalt. The cobbles extend in single file N to S about 1.35m and then finish. There are two large cobbles which may connect to the wall that face E to W adjacent to the wall. There are a few smaller cobbles a centimeter or two above the level of the other cobbles running E to W as well. From above the wall looks like a T intersection of two corners.    While digging in L4000 we peeled back in L4001, the fill above the potsmash. We continued to dig along the east border of the locus looking for additional pot sherds and possible surfaces associated with the potsmash. We found nothing substantial so we shaved some excess dirt from the N and S parts of the locus. We found 1 or 2 additional sherds in situ in the S and also a large animal bone, a possible cow ankle bone far from the rest of the pottery and cobbles. Interestingly enough there were very few bones in this locus. All of the attempts to find more pot sherds resulted in an extension of the locus by .5m to .75m N and S. We decided to give up our search and clean the locus for a photo. After the photo we closed L4001 and began L4002. L4002 is the pot sherds and associated stones and bone below the fill in L4001. We began bagging all of the sherds that were easily extracted (KT 4013-4015). The pottery could be classified into two types, large pieces of coarse ware and smaller pieces of finer ware. We found several large rims and a nicely preserved handle in two pieces. Tomorrow we will finish collecting the artifacts from the locus and look at what is underneath.    We finished the day by cutting a small section in front of the row of cobbles in L4000 facing N. the section is about .5m x .5m.

We are still coming across very few rocks and pottery, this is likely due to good plowing and rock removal from planted fields, also being so close to the cliff it would have been easy to toss rocks and such over. The trench area thus appears to have been part of a well worked field until recently.   At depth 66.18 meters the soil color begins to change. I open a new locus (8001) and will work on leveling most of the trench at this new depth. Color is now at 7.5 YR 3/4 dark brown on the Munsell chart. Composition is still medium to coarse and the type is loam.   A bit more pottery sherds are found in relation to yesterday in L8000.    As we cut down North to South we locate an small oven pit with partial remains of the oven walls. There may be additional pieces of the oven in the pottery bags from today (KT #s 8003 and 8006). This oven becomes Locus 8002. The location of the oven is 3.62 meters from the Northwest corner of the trench and it is situated within the West baulk of the trench. The oven is at a depth of .315 from the beginning surface elevation. Its dimensions are .55 meters long (N-S) and .35 meters wide from the baulk into the trench (W-E). The 3.62 meters from the Northwest corner refer to a measurement at the center of the oven. All four related measurements are to the center of L8002.

Then we scraped the section really well looking for lines or indications that there is something other than fill in the area. There are still sherds coming up in the dirt in L 4039.   Took down the half of L 4040 that was higher and level with L 4039. The part of the area closest to L 4037 is pulling up virgin soil. This side closest the baulk still has the original soft soil of the locus so we'll keep digging.   Closed pit L 4034. The soil has ceased to be ashy and when you look in the section you can see the curving line where it sweeps in and the line at the bottom where it ends. Looks like we may have gone through the bottom by about 5cm.   Bradley came and looked at the trench and confirmed what I had noticed. There is still just fill so we adopted a new program. We're making pick passes of roughly 10cm across the trench. As we go we'll stop and trowel and clean. If something comes up we'll stop and go more carefully. This method encompasses four loci which I will of course keep in separate KT bags. It includes L 4040, L 4039 and L 4038. There is also a very small part of L 4041 that we took down lower while exploring the mystery of the white line.   Well, after a day of this method we are still coming up with a big zero. The fill continues, but the features are nonexistent. It is all fairly soft, brownish fill. There are not a lot of artifacts coming up for the amount of dirt moved. The new locus L 4043 has produced about 3 very small sherds today. It's not virgin soil, but its pretty sterile.

After that 20 cm a softer (this is relative, it's still pretty tough) soil was found. The most southerly ~ 40 cm had a thin layer above a very thin ash layer and was excavated as L5041. Both loci turned up some interesting finds, including more of the white-on-black pottery that has been turning up all over the southern half of the trench, some slag (KT 5209), and a polished bone which may be some sort of seal stamp (KT 5210).    The far NE corner was also dug (L5020) and the end of the rock jumble seems to finally have been reached. Aside from the general theory of it being tumble as that was the part of the trench nearest to the topsoil, I also think there may have been some flow-through from surface L5034 when the corner of it (walls 5039 and 5037) finally gave way.   Tomorrow I hope to take 5041 (the area below it, actually) down to the level of the rest of the 5027 (which is pending redesignation). The majority of the trench is now (finally) down to approximately the same level. It would be nice to better articulate oven L5029 and start to bring the central mudbrick wall (L5031) down some more.

In L3016 we pushed farther E trying to follow the hard cobble surface L3025 in order in that area. We also scraped 1/2 - 1 cm of dirt off the cobble surface L3025 in order to help define it. It still looks like the cobble surface does not continue N but I'm still not sure. In a day or two I think I will dig a small 50 cm by 50cm window in the NW corner unless the baulk in trench C2, which shares my NW baulk, reveals something.   We dug 5 cm in L3021 which is the locus W of the stone wall L3005 in the western half of the trench. There was no change in the soil so I didn't change loci. It did define some more of the stones and as we push further N we will have a better idea about what the wall is doing.   Finally we started lifting the cobble L3013 which is located in the SE corner. The surface is about a cm thick and there are a few stones underneath. Perhaps these are related to the stones that are at the N side of this locus.   After looking at L3025 it seems that the workers dug S past the wall L3016 into L3021. When looking at it I can see the wall even though they only dug 5 cm. This could mean a couple things. Either I mis-identified the wall L3016 and it is not actually a wall, or we dug through the wall. In either case the loci for this day are mixed.

The surface is very clear and has a little pottery debris that is currently being articulated and will be collected and KT'd after photos are taken. The other surprise in L7003 today was a human cranium that appears in the cobbled surface. As of right now we are unclear as to whether the burial cuts the surface or whether the cobbled surface seals the burial...further excavation is necessary. The cranium rests against the north eastern baulk and will be articulated and collected by the bone people tomorrow. As of yet we have not named a new locus.

But I did not give it its own Kt because it doesn't seem to be that special to me. (Looks like end of a pole made out of pottery)   In L4015 there is a part with reddish soil in it.   Also in L4032it seems the soft ashy soil continues down. This pit might be connected with L4003 because there is a soft part connecting these two. But it is possible that happened by a root or an animal.   We took the surface L4034 out.

Beforehand we took pictures and entered them in the palm pilot. There were three small pieces of broken pottery under its head. Last week some local workers told us that Islamic people are buried with a rock underneath their head. We also found a broken piece of pottery underneath the skeleton's head in Locus number 1035. I'm guessing that we'll find these pieces under the heads of several skeletons in this burial site.     This was the only active locus in area A1 today.

The pit ended up being larger than suspected. We found it cutting beneath locus 6003 in the East side of the trench. Some ceramic and bone were discovered. We then moved south and removed L6006 so that it was relatively level with L6002 and L6003. Afterwards we pushed through the baulk that sat beneath the pit--6005--I named this locus 6009. We were moving a lot of dirt until we ran up against some mudbrick and what appears to be a burial right before the day ended. I didn't have time to get elevations and thus finish the day plan. L6009 is a brown soil type that sits beneath L6005 (ashy silt layer) and next to L6006. We excavated it such that it was level with the bottom of the trench or loci 6002 and 6003.       I ended the day by scraping away what turned out to be sterile locus 6008. The locus sits just below 6004. The soil for 6008 was a reddish brown that looked quite a bit different from the more ashy/silty L6007. Hence, I also defined locus 6007 as being separate from 6008. L6007 is a greyer, silty ash strat that I'll try to excavate tomorrow.      ,~: F-6-2001-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 6/Locus 6002,"324,2001-07-23," D-4-2001-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4004,","   July 23, 2001      We finished taking photos with the spider, thanks to Drew and Andy.

The yellowish dirt in L3014 is distinct and continuous into A5 at the same level (pushed a bit into A5 to establish this).      The mixed color in L3012 looks to be a result of some decomposing adobe fragments n the west end and possibly near the north sidewall in the east (about 4m). There is also diffuse mix of charcoal fragments, but not as dense as the sediments in L3015 or any of the ashy stains/concentrations. This area is less consolidated and contains visible pottery fragments not found in 3014 (W) or 3015 (S).      Sketch available in hard copy.      Although five loci were assigned to this area, beginning to think that there should only have been two new ones: yellowish clay zone in the NW corner (L3013) and the mixed clay adobe melt and yellowish clay in the center (L3015).

We called this hump 2074 also. I had the workers dig to the step created by the joint between 2071 and 2074. This is in order to catch a north section on the wall 2076. L2074 had lots of large potsherds that seemed to be floating in the soil (i.e., not lying flat on a surface). There seemed to be brick-like material (large chunks with one or two straight edges) coming out at the north edge of 2074, but this brick-like material seems to be collapse debris rather than a wall.      Once the base of the new part of 2074 was level with the base of 2080 and the old part of 2074, we took the area down another 5-7cm to trace the top burn line (Munsell 7.5YR 4/3 \brown\) visible in the north at the 5m peg. This 5-7cm section was collected as 2074, since there appears to be continuity in the soil characteristics. The area from the 5m edge back (southwards) about 30-40cm was soft and crumbly, then became hard like mudbrick or mudbrick debris south of that rough border.      The level in our area is broken, so we measured the space in 2074 between the top and bottom burn lines at the 5m peg, munselled the soil and took the area down to the level of the lower burn line. We see two burn lines in the west baulk to the north of the 5m peg also, so the affected area may be more expansive than we can catch in this narrow trench. I decided to spit the KT bags but keep the same locus to continue digging the small area between the 2 burn layers (this is really because I am not entirely sure what is happening in this area and to play it safe, new KT bags seemed to be a reasonable compromise rather than confusing the issue with more loci). The area of L2074 is rather confusing. The burn areas seem to skip around. Bradley's theory is that we may have a small cooking hearth on an ash surface. Since the point is to find the perimeter of wall 2076, we will continue to push southwards to make the chunked-up step of L2074 level with the lowest burn mark, also extending eastwards to include the area of L2080.      It turns out that there are at lest 4 courses of brick visible in the cut at 2074 (joint with 2080) and maybe a 5th brick is appearing. This must be the end (bottom) of the wall, though, because a large cobblestone (15-20cm dia) is sitting in line with the orientation of the wall.      I troweled in the SW corner on the west baulk below the line where the plaster on wall 2056 seems to stop. It appears that 2056 may be founded on the layer of grey soil that supports 2061 plaster surface (ie, the grey soil that the plaster is stuck to). This means that the thin layer between red soil 2063 and white plaster 2061 does not appear to abut 2056 and in addition, 2061 does indeed appear to run underneath 2056, meaning that the red surface must predate the wall 2056.      After breakfast we started digging L2078 in the SW corner of the trench using a big pick. We took this area down 20cm flush with the base of 2073 the western half). We stopped digging 2078 at the same level as the base of L2073, but conveniently, we came up with a new context at that level anyway. In the far SW corner, there is a darker red pebble-strewn surface with bits of what is either white mold between bricks or plaster fragments (the latter is more likely). We stopped digging here, closed the KT bags an dug out the mini-baulk between 2078 an 2073 to see if there is a line demarcating the end of 2073.      The hearth 2073 ends with medium sized cobbles (5 visible) in the base. These cobbles were found upon removing the mini-baulk (we took a big carbon sample from this mini-baulk and labeled it as 2078).         ,~: A-2-2001-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,"330,2001-07-24," A-1-2001-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1039,","   July 24, 2001      Plans altered.

I stayed to monitor work in A1 and to assist Andrew with layout of new trench extensions N, and E (RP).       We assigned 2 new loci today. The first locus appears to be a wall made from stones and broken pottery. The second turned out to be the feet of an individual which were thought to be hands last year.

Less than 5 pieces of bone (all small fragments) were recovered.

The likely cranium is in the excavated portion of A3. At this point have series of metatarsals, in place, along with top of talus of each foot exposed. These are in fair to poor condition. Horizontal expansions necessary to remove the burial are all within the limits of A3. This burial will be referred to from this point as A3 L. 3002. Field records will shift to the A3 .

The cobble surface does not continue north at the this level. Perhaps it comes sharply down and is under the current surface of dirt. C2 has cleared their baulk and I can see that the cobble surface does not continue into their baulk. I need now to define new loci. I will do that tomorrow when I have the morning light and a clean area. In the south when expanding to try to define the wall the borders were about 10 cm past where the wall was supposed to be. This is the same problem that I had yesterday. I am probably trying to define a mud wall which is incredibly hard to do. So we have the same problem as yesterday where we probably have mixed loci. Tomorrow I will have Lynne help me with the redefinition of my loci Also, there was miscommunication with one of my workers who started digging the mound of conglomerated something which is on top of the cobble surface. I caught him almost right away but the west most 5 cm is gone.   Today we also scraped 5 cm off the top of L3021 starting from yesterday's stopping point and continuing N all the way to its northern border with L3025. I did this for 2 reasons. First, I wanted to try to catch the other side of the wall L3017 which was unsuccessful because L3025 was extended past it. Second, I wanted to articulate the W side of the stone wall L3005. This was unsuccessful although I don't see an associated surface on the W side of it.   We also lifted almost the entire cobble surface of 3013 in the SE part of the trench. Here we found a grinding stone KT3194 and a terra cotta half circle with a hole through the center (KT3190). We also revealed more stones that may be associated with the stones in the rest of the locus. All the stones seem to be inside or underneath the cobble surface, so the cobble surface is probably later than the stones.

This is difficult due to the layout of the trench over the cliff, which make the Southwest quadrant of the 5 x 10 meters trench much lower than the rest. Because of this I will leave that quadrant mostly alone for now until I have a better idea of the stratigraphy.   We have not located any substantial features with the exception of the small oven L8002. How and why were this ovens used? By comparison with the farm workers on the pepper plantation below area F and nearer to the Tigris River on a valley below Kenan Tepe, they utilize small rest stops that contain huts for shade and protection and very possibly ovens like that in L8002. When the lower town area of Kenan Tepe was farmed this would have been a highly strategic point from which to view the river and the plantings and do the cooking and resting.   After breakfast we began work on L8001. Most of L8000 did not give clues to ancient peoples, yet some valuable information is learned, such as: possible uses for the ovens found in the area as well as depositional history of the lower town and farming practices. After L8002 was located I expect to continue down about .10 meters at a time until the possible floor in which the oven sits is located. But, if the oven was simply put there by digging a hole through layers at a later time a floor will obviously not be located.   After we put a cover over F8 the temperature reached 107.

We found no artifacts. We then began excavating L6011 that sat just beneath L6008. Extending about 5\ from the north baulk we found some mudbrick with bone underneath it. Since we were digging quickly, as is generally the case with soundings, we disturbed what appears to be a burial. We also found some ash just east of the bones and mudbrick that seems to be clearly associated with the rest of the cultural material. Bradley looked at the mudbrick and said to go ahead and dig L6011 to be even with the north baulk. We then excavated L6007 but found no artifacts. The locus was 14cm deep in the NW corner and 15cm deep at its west side. Once that locus was removed, we dug L6010 similarly to how we dug 6011. That is, we picked-out the remaining block all the way to the North baulk. Most notably, we found a big concentration of ceramic in the NW corner in the bottom 10cm.       At the very end of the day we were trying to even-out the floor and scrape the sidewalls. The transit was occupied in one of the three F trenches at the end of the day, thus I'll have to take elevations in the morning.       p.s.   The soil types for L6010 and L6011 were very similar. They were defined separately as a byproduct of dividing the trench in half and excavating it as a sounding. 6010 sits beneath L6007 and L6005, which were both excavated as separate ash bits.

There is one piece of basalt among these rocks very similar to the one in the partial wall uncovered yesterday. It is possible that these two walls are related to each other and both walls together may be part of a system of stone architecture in Trench A5 about 1m away from Trench B4's baulk.

The trench shares a baulk with C3- the southwest corner of C2 is the northwest corner of C3. C1 and C4 are nearby to the north. This year we are continuing the excavation of this trench which was opened last year. C2 is a 5x5, though the baulks seem to be creeping outward. The starting elevations for this year generally lay between 93.5 and 92.5m. At the end of the season the northwest corner on top of the wall was at 92.99m, the surfaces and pits in the south were in the range of the 92.40s m, and the rest of the trench was generally in the range of the 92.60s m.    The goals for this year were to get through all the offseason wash and erosion and to begin to understand the relationships between the walls found last year and any associated surfaces.       Methods   This year was not a large dirt moving operation as shown by the beginning and ending elevations for the season. C2 was excavated primarily with small picks and trowels. We dug this way because most of our effort was focused on determining the stratigraphic relationships between the various walls, surfaces, and pits. Soil was not screened because of time constraints. Altogether the excavation proceeded slowly with the painstaking removal of thin layers.      Excavation Summary   Excavation began with the cleaning of wash and erosion from the off season. Cleaning loci include 2050-2054. The southwest part of the trench was covered by a jumble of stones and the northeast was mudbricky and riddled with rodent burrows. As cleaning continued an extensive ashy area appeared in the northeast. It seems that rodent burrows are responsible for its extent. The soft soil would have been conducive to rodent activity and could have spread the ash beyond the original border of the ash pit.    As walls 2048 and 2046 were cleaned off the boundaries became more clear. The picture also started to clear up in the southwest where a semicircular arrangement of stones began to demarcate a pit, 2057. A gray ashy pit was also becoming visible in the southeast, 2061. Meanwhile a mudbrick wall, 2067, was becoming apparent starting in the north center of the trench and running to the southwest. This wall was cleaned and defined. It consisted of 2 courses. The courses were taken off one at a time and it was found that the wall was underlaid by an ashy surface.   Once everything had been cleaned up, more or less, we could begin to understand the stratigraphy of the trench. We started by taking down the lower wall, 2046. While taking down the western part of the wall we uncovered another wall, later named 2088. The new wall was oriented more to the northwest than the overlying wall. We also began to examine the pits that were appearing in the southwest quadrant of the trench. We started with 2082, a sealed pt beginning about a meter north of the south baulk along the west baulk. A couple of grinding stones were found. At the bottom of 2083, a pit in the southwest corner, a surface began to appear. We moved on to a large pit in the south central part of the trench (originally 2076, but excavated as 2084), originally thought to be a metal working pit based on the finding of slag in context. This pit was excavated very slowly, peeling away at it layer by layer and taking photos after each. 2084 was surrounded by a pile of stones which was taken off as a separate locus 2087. The area surrounding 2087 and 2084 was dug as 2075. Here we were looking for the relationships between walls, 2048 and 2088, and pit 2084. This uncovered another course of stones belonging to 2088.   In the northwest we found two pits enclosed within an area of fill by 2048 and a mudbrick wall, 2080. In the southeast we took down the remainder of 2046 as 2094. Below this lay more of the gray ashy area, 2090. We also found another ash pit, 2101, just to the north of 2088 which was rich in carbon samples.   The most interesting area of the trench was the south central part. Below 2075 we uncovered a surface which seemed to extend to the southwest corner. At about the same time we reached another surface at the bottom of 2084. It was at this point that we realized that we had a room with two levels of occupation. We peeled back to find the extension of the upper surface, 2095 and found that it did indeed extend to the southwest corner. Interestingly, this surface overlaid the southern part of 2048. The surface was bounded on the east by 2088. This extensive and deep surface yielded a great amount of pottery. 2095 could be related to surface 2089 in the northeast which is at a similar level, but that relationship is not totally clear. The lower surface was excavated as 2099. As we worked westward we found that the surface stopped at the old boundary of 2083. Here instead we found a broken line of white plaster and mud feature, renamed 2098. Immediately north of 2098 is an area of fill which may overlay part of 2099.   After digging had ceased for the season and we were taking photos we noticed that mudbrick wall 2080 could extend under 2048 over to 2101. It could also extend to the southeast corner as the soil there is very hard. No clear lines were defined, though. It also looks as if we have a mudbrick wall on the eastern edge of 2091 abutting 2048.      Finds   Nothing truly spectacular was found in C2 this year. The finds were mostly domestic in nature with grindstones (10 total) being the most abundant, but 2 pestles, 3 oven bases, a couple of obsidian blade pieces and a stone bowl fragment were also found. In addition we recovered a netweight, a piece of bronze, and a worked stone disc. Most of the items were found in pits or surfaces on the south and west sides of the trench, though the stone disc and one grindstone were found in the northeast part of the trench in the fill above and below surface 2089.      Interpretations   The stratigraphy of C2 was fairly complex. Just as things looked like they were making sense, new surfaces or other complications emerged. By the end of the season, though, the picture became clearer.    The most complicated and interesting part of the trench was the south central region bounded by walls 2048 and 2088, and including pit 2084. Within this region are two surfaces: 2095 the upper surface and 2099 the lower surface. The lower surface is bounded on the east by wall 2088 and ends abruptly in the west at the old boundary of pit 2083. Upon this surface was founded both walls 2048 and 2088. It also serves as the lower boundary of pit 2084. The relationship between this surface and the one it abuts in the west (2098 a mud and plaster feature) remains unclear. Over time refuse built up on 2099 and began to spill over onto 2048. This indicates that 2048 was out of use by this time. Here it became the upper surface which extended from the west baulk to 2088. It was into this surface that 2084 was cut. A circle of stones (2087) was then piled around the pit. Within pit 2086 we started to see the beginning of a surface which could be related to either the upper or the lower surfaces.   In the southeast part of the trench lies a grey ashy pit area, 2090, the extent of which was not dug. It is probably related to the lower surface as the ash continues under 2088. To the north of 2088 lies another ash pit, 2101.    In the northeast lay a chunky surface, 2089. This is at about the same level as 2095 so the two may be related. The picture remains unclear for now. Just to the south of 2089 is an area of fill with patches that could represent mudbricks, but we were unable to define any clear lines.   In the northwest we found two pits inside a fill locus which was bounded by 2048 on the north and east and by a mudbrick wall 2080 on the south. It is possible that these were fire pits enclosed within a fire shield. After digging had stopped and photos were being taken it was observed that 2080 could actually extend below wall 2048 to the carbon rich ash pit 2101. This would place the mudbrick wall under stone wall 2046 as well. 2080 could reach as far as the southeast corner as this area is hard and mudbricky. If this is the case then 2101 must cut 2080. How this mudbrick wall relates to the surfaces in the south and northeast reaches of the trench remains to be seen.      State of the Trench   All in all we ceased excavation this year at a good point. We were able to piece together some of the stratigraphic relationships within the trench and by leaving the walls in place we allow for future investigation into any remaining questions. Several issues have been raised. The first concerns 2080, its extent and relation to the above described surfaces and pits. Does it actually continue to the southeast corner? Does it relate in any way to the hard patches in the eastern part of the trench? Another mudbrick wall also seems to be appearing in the eastern part of 2091, abutting 2048. Did 2048 cut into this? The ashy southeast also remains unclear. Further excavation is especially needed in the southwest corner to determine what is going on with the mud and plaster feature and any appearing surfaces. The features of the south central region of the trench may also extend into trench C3.

Also we removed L4018 (door opening looking locus) and L4025 was also continuing under this locus. In the NW quarter of the trench we also removed the surface L4022 and immediately another feature came out. (But that happened the last day so I didn't give a new locus number to that because we couldn't find out the dimensions yet.    In the NE quarter we removed L4011 and L4012 that are rock features that we couldn't find out what. Then we started to level the N side of this quarter with the NW side of the trench then we hit L4033 which is a feature that we found a sceptre. The aim of leveling was finding out the feature that was looking like L4030 which is a wall. We couldn't find the edge of this wall yet but still working on that. So that possible feature does not have a locus number yet.   In the SW side of the trench we removed the surface L4009 and dig the whole part as L4021 to the level of the previous probe that we dug as L4021. (that is the exact same color and same fill so I choose to continue as L4021) Than we hit an oven at the S side of the portion. (L4035)   In the SE portion we started to follow the surfaces from the W part to the E part. Then we found out an outside working area next to the wall which might be associated with L4030. We took out L4015 out after we found out that has no relationship with the wall. But when we articulated this locus more we an alignment on the W side and if that is the case the rest of the rocks in the E side shall be the collapse of that aligned rocks which may be a wall. We also identified that the area on the E side of the L4030 was softer and that turned to be a huge ash pit with some mud brick in it.    To summarize, we started to take out some features. The interesting thing there was, some of these features have two rows and the first row was always river rocks and the second row was big huge sand stone like, smooth face yellowish rocks. The other thing that we tried to find out was the wall L4030. We tried to figure out the associated surface of that. But we could not find anything else than the small surface L4034.    There is something else that I noticed this week. L4015 and L4023 both have rock alignments and both have kind of collapse at their Eastern side. If we consider gravity and the existing slope of the hill that should not be like that.            ,~: C-4-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4,"345,2001-07-26," C-3-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3,","   C3 Week 4 Weekly    July 26, 2001      This week has been interesting we have dug in the entire area and have found things that are important all over. I will start with the SE corner. We removed most of the cobble surface L3013 which has the stone feature in its NE corner border. We found some grindstones and some interesting pottery in the surface. We also found that the stones that were scattered throughout the surface actually lie deeper that the surface. That means that the cobbles were put down after the stones. I'm not sure if the stones are part of a bigger structure hiding in the baulk or what I need to dig further to understand their function. They are not part of the rest of the area unless the area was terraced at this point.   In the NE portion, now L3024, we decided that since we weren't seeing much in the midtrench baulk which L3024 is part of we would bring it down about 50cm to the surface that we could see in the baulk which was a few centimeters above L3018 and L3020. We went down and found nothing remarkable until we dug a 1 m window into the SW end of L3024. Here we found a cobble surface that is the same as the one we found when digging in L3018. Under L3018 which is west of L3024 and abutting it we found a series of cobble surfaces one on top of another but not continuous west. What I mean is that there area a series of surfaces that are on separate levels starting ant the W baulk moving east and continuing to the mid trench baulk but every do often another level appears a couple of centimeters above the last but is was not present over the surfaces east of it. We originally thought that they were surfaces that were eroded each year by the seasonal rain. After finding the surface continuing into L3024 and looking at the section of C2, which shows surfaces cutting into the hill and even downwards into the hill against its natural curve, I think that a second possibility is that the area was terraced and that these could be eroded and worn steps up to a higher level. Though the eroded surfaces idea is not out the window.    Lastly in the SW part of the trench I have been working on articulating the stone wall L3005 and seeing what it is doing relative to the cobble surfaces in L3025. I was wondering why if it continued N why we didn't see it over the cobble surface or in the section of C2 which abuts my NW baulk. After some articulation I found some stones that run eastward and may mean that the wall L3005 may corner at a east running wall. I'm not sure if this is contemporary with the cobble surface. I will have to see if I can find a connection next week.     ,~: C-3-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3,"346,2001-07-26," C-3-2001-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,","   July 26, 2001      Today we did three things. We closed what remained of L3012 and brought the area under it down about 50 cm, we dug 5 cm down in L3020 and we leveled the S end of L3024.   We closed the remainder of L3012, which contains the area 1 m south of L3024 and 1 m+ E of the mid trench baulk in, and dug underneath it, L3024, in order to try to find the walls L3016 and L3017 which have been elusive previously. We brought it down and about 3 cm above where L3020 and L3018 abut it we found a hard cobble surface which is just like the cobble surface in L3025. We brushed the area surrounding it and we found that the surface is either continued at a severe uphill slat from the lower surface or that there are several similar surfaces piled on top of one another or that this is not a surface but something else. I want to see where it continues before I make any other decisions about his area.   We dug down in L3020, which is the area W of the stone wall L3005, in order to do two things. First to try and articulate the stone wall and see what it is doing at its northern part and second to try and catch the southern part of the wall L3016. We were successful in articulating the wall a little and we uncovered a couple of stones which could mean that the stone wall L3005 may turn east. We were unsuccessful in our second goal. We did not find anything in the northern area which would help us find our wall. There may be no wall there. What could be happening is that the wall that I thought that I had found was actually dirt compacted on top of the cobble surface of whatever it is in L3025.    We also leveled the S border of L3024 because it was not level. There we found incredibly hard pact dirt but only in one area and some broken pottery and some pottery fragments. There may be an oven close to here. I don't know, we found this at the end of the day and I won't have time to examine it until later.     ,~: C-3-2001-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,"347,2001-07-26," A-1-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 1/Locus 1040,","   July 26, 2001      Week 4 Summary      A1. We were able to remove the child burial (L. 1038), but not the last burial (A1 L. 1040/A3 L. 3002). This burial was covered by significant overburden (unexcavated portion of A3). Also, crew took lab day on 7/25, which changed excavation schedule for the week. Where we are after 3 weeks:       Determining spatial extent of the cemetery.       1)Cemetery excavations have been extended as far W as we will extend this year (A3 reaches to point 0.75m from B4, which covers span to Area C, which produced no burials). There is evidence the cemetery becomes less dense as we expand from E-W (reduction of #burials from 6 in A3 [E] to 2 in A5). Each covers an area of 16m2.      2)Current excavations in A6(?) reach within 2m of N edge of flat portion of mound top. We will not extend the last 2m because of practical limitations_ÑÓtrench would made movement on top of mound, especially with wheelbarrows and other equipment unnecessarily difficult.      3)Current excavations toward E (A4, A7?) reach the easternmost level ground on the top of the mound.      Two areas we would like to fit on during last week (4) of field season:      1)Would like to extend S in area where burials are relatively dense (E end of mound). B4 extends to S edge of flat area, but falls W of area of densest cemetery use. S extension of A5 from E end is most likely. Would need to be extended 6-8m, max.      2)Would like to put a test sounding nearer the center of the mound top (N and W of A1. Currently we are confined (for practical reasons) to the edges of the mound top.

This means that we did not go to the site. Yesterday I did add a new locus in the comfort of the pension. We added locus L1030, which will be the east baulk from the top down to the original heights, which I need to shoot still. When we cut the baulks straight at the beginning of the year pottery sherds, as well some human bones from a burial, began to show up in the baulk. The decision was made within the past couple of days to keep some of this pottery and the human bones so I assigned it a locus. These items became KT1150 for the pottery sherds, KT1151 for the human burial, and KT1152 for a small find, an over-fired sherd of pottery.   Amazingly, yesterday saw me add more KT numbers than today did. We only were able to dig in two areas. In 1028 we dug down about 10cm. Only a handful of pottery was found. The dirt was softer towards the east baulk and harder towards the other side of the locus. In 1019 we dug down about 10 cm also, in the part which was to the west of the area where the pits were excavated. This area was very hard, and only some pottery sherds were found.   We did fill up over a dozen sandbags, for ourselves, and also for our new neighbor in F9, same as our old neighbor in F4, Dawnell. After this we were expecting an analysis of our trench, along with spraying and assorted things to determine what to do next. This never really happened, as Bradley and Andy got caught up in other things which kept them away from the trench. Eventually my workers and I went over to help out Dawnell for the last hour of the day. At least we tried to be useful.    Today is Andy's birthday.

The workmen focused their efforts on L7000 and brought down the elevation to around 15-20 cms. above the cobbled surface. In doing so, they found 2 grindstones (KT#'s 7061 and 7064) and one spindle whirl (KT#7060) that were all entered as small finds. They also came upon an area about halfway through the trench that was littered with flat-lying pottery sherds and at least one grindstone. I think that this is indicative of a later surface than the cobbled surface we have been working with in L7003. I created L7009 in this area so that we can explore the surface possibility separate from the surrounding topsoil. Although L7009 was identified today, no opening elevations or Munselling was completed. It will have to be done first thing Saturday morning.       I focused my energy on articulating the cobbled surface in L7003 and determining where it continued and its boundaries. The cobblestones do not cover the area directly around the cranium so it would appear that the burial does indeed cut L7003. Also, the cobbles continue north and south of the 2x2, but seem to end 1/2 a meter to the west of L7000. As a result of this information, the following loci were named today: L7005 for the actual cobbled surface, L7006 for the burial, and L7007 for the fill directly west of the cobbled surface. Intuitively, one could deduce that L7003 was closed. These new loci were not Munselled and did not have opening elevations taken today...it will be done first thing Saturday morning.      The last thing to note is the opening of L7008 in the northwestern area of the trench. The workmen actually worked in this area Tuesday (7/24/01) and uncovered another area of pottery lying flat on the ground, indicative of another surface. I named it as a locus today, but did not take elevations or Munsell...obviously I have my work cut out for me on Saturday!        ,~: F-7-2001-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,"350,2001-07-26," F-1-2001-07-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,","   July 26, 2001   Week 4 Weekly Summary      The burial L1021 was finally completely excavated. I still have not removed the locus from dayplans because I have taken the areas around the former burial down to the same level so that we can tell where we need to divide the soil into new loci. We are planning on making a complete study and evaluation of my trench at the beginning of the week, and at that time I will have new loci in this area, as well as maybe in other areas.    L1019 had two large soft areas which we felt were probably animal burrows, that we were excavating as part of L1019. After their excavation it looks instead as though they are actually pits which we excavated. These pits had some pottery and bones, and they were listed as part of L1019.   This week did not give me any exciting small finds. The most exciting thing about the week is that we saw the beginnings of a brick wall, one column wide so far, each brick about 25cm wide and 10cm long, which goes from the east baulk towards the west baulk for 1.26 meters. This wall lays to the south side of what we felt may have been an oven, since it appeared to have a wall bordering it on the south side as well as the west side. Unfortunately, when we dug the oven area it was very hard and did not give me hardly any artifacts. It may not be an oven after all.    There are brick protrusions showing up in several places, in L1026, L1019, L1025. We hope that we are able to see how these brick protrusions, and their possible continuation, relate to each other. In the coming week we want to see if we can come up with better context for the trench, instead of merely alternating which loci are chopped down 10 cm at a time.    This week was difficult because of the lack of exciting finds, but looking at the baulks we can see that even though there have been no small finds we have dug down quite a ways, and we know that we will find some surfaces and more walls soon, along with more artifacts.     ,~: F-1-2001-07-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,"351,2001-07-26," D-5-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,","   Weekly Summary 4--Week ending July 26, 2001   This week was partially lost, in terms of digging, to a day of drawing and photography and a day at the lab. However, some interesting progress was made.   Because everything was documented so nicely via photos and drawings, we were finally able to increase our understanding by cutting through some features and seeing if the reveal anything new. Of course, they revealed new things, but they weren't all in line with what had been expected.   In the south part of the trench, surface L5027 looks like it was good, as were surrounding mudbrick walls L5008 and L5031. However, SW pit L5029 was, upon further examination, determined to be an oven which cut wall L5008 and the surface, and is possibly related to a later pebble surface. Also of note is that some collapsed mudbrick was found while excavating to better understand pit L5024 and is at the same level and may be related to a new mudbrick wall, SW-NE, L5045 which is just now beginning to appear.   Meanwhile, the north remains somewhat unclear. Surface L5034 appears to have a good abuttal with wall L5039 on the E, but its connection to wall L5037 in NW is becoming tenuous, as from excavation of the area where the two should be abutting uncovered very soft and loose soil.... not degraded mudbrick. There is also an ash layer beneath all of L5034 which may actually split the locus from its current dimensions. Though the central mudbrick mess L5031 was cut down at the end of this week, the area didn't have time for a good scraping and cleaning, so hopefully some answers will be forthcoming from there next week.   Finally there is now a cluster of small, round, pottery-lined ovens near the SE corner of L5034 whose context is unclear but may be related. Unfortunately, as they were all discovered at slightly different levels and thus two are becoming pedestled, it may be hard to eventually figure out to what the three were originally associated with.     ,~: D-5-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"352,2001-07-26," F-4-2001-07-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4,","   July 26, 2001   Week 4 Summary      This week has really signified the winding down of this trench and its imminent closure. Sine the oven was closed we have not pulled up any other features.   One thing of note was the disappointing development of L 4041. After the area was taken down 20cm the red line that lead to its discovery disappeared. However, running parallel below it was a white plaster line. Unfortunately this did not give us much information. It may have been in brick seams, but L 4041 is definitely not a wall. There is no mudbrick in section, no brick lines, and the soil was too soft and loamy to be old mudbrick. These lines would appear to be doing something as they follow the same boundaries, but I can't tell what.   I also discovered that the pit L 4034 was not follows correctly. It was dug about 30 cm too large. The line narrowed very rapidly and I did not catch that it had moved in until too late. Thus some soil of what should have been L 4040 was excavated as a pit.   A lot of energy this week was spent of attempting to get to virgin soil throughout the whole trench. It finally crept into L 4040, but I'm still looking for it in L 4038 and L 4039. The mysterious L 4041 is not quite virgin soil, but I can see the line where it starts as it abuts L 4037 which is at virgin soil.   At this point I have a workman with a big pick making 15cm passes over the riverside third of the trench. I come and look when he's done and if it's still fill he keeps going. We should reach virgin soil next week although right at the end of the week it looks as if an ash pit may be coming up.   If we do reach virgin soil we will then cut out a section of L 4027, the oven wall, so we can get more information to describe it better and then we'll close the trench.     ,~: F-4-2001-07-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4,"353,2001-07-26," D-4-2001-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4004,","   July 26, 2001      I have taken elevations for L4024, L4023, 4027, and also a second elevation for L4023 from the SW corner of the trench.         I think that I have made a mistake, because when we had checked my note book with Andy, we recognized that the levels of the pit doesn't make sense that's why I have taken new elevations, and now I will try to articulate the pit a bit more as I can.         While I was articulating the pit I have recognized that there is ash in it. That's why I will take new elevations and then I will give it a new locus number. More or less I have finished cleaning up L4023, it has various of pottery pieces on (it is the surface beneath L4009 that is showing up).      I have articulated the pit that has the L4024, and now its locus is changed, because I have said it before I found ash in the pit near to the bottom, so the new locus is 4028. By the way I began to clean up L4027, I am planning to remove the whole locus of 4027.       Just a few minutes before we had fun in the trench because one of my workers called Cafer brought a turtle to the trench form Tigris, and Greer took some photos of it that it was on the locus 4023.      The whole thing that I have done today was to articulate, and to remove the whole surface of L4027.     ,~: D-4-2001-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4004,"354,2001-07-26," F-7-2001-07-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7000,","   July 26, 2001   Week 4 Summary      This week can be succinctly described by saying that we moved a lot of dirt in hopes to find some kind of surface or other architectural features in F-7. We were expecting a cobbled surface on the Eastern side of the trench based on excavation in what was F-2 last year. In order to find this surface we opened a 2x2 window in the northwest corner of the trench (L7000) at the beginning of the week. We found the surface on 7/23/2001 as well as a human cranium (L7006), presumably in a pit, that appears to cut the surface (L7005) in the northeast corner of the trench alongside the eastern baulk. After articulating the surface in the 2x2 window, it appears as though the surface extends southward under what is currently L7000. The surface does not appear to extend westward. The surface is composed of cobblestones that range from 5 to 10 cms in diameter and small pebbles in hard, compact soil.          In our attempts to remove dirt in both L7000 and L7004, topsoil and subtopsoil loci, we found two areas, one in the eastern half and the other in the western half of the trench that have a lot of flat lying pottery sherds. We named 2 different loci (the area under L7004 is now L7008 and the area under L7000 is now L7009.) As of right now we do not know if these are actually surfaces. If they are in fact surfaces that appear at a higher elevation than our cobbled surface, they would logically indicate a later period of occupation. Next week we will continue to expose what we know to be a surface (L7005) and what we think might be surfaces (L7008 and L7009) and try to shed more light on what their relationship to each other might be.     ,~: F-7-2001-07-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7000,"355,2001-07-26," B-4-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 4,","   Weekly Summary 4: Week ending July 26, 2001         Trench B4 is a 10 x 10m trench which has trench B1 (excavated last year) as its South Western corner. We opened this trench so that we could catch some of the E.I.A. context that we found last year on a surface in Trench B1. We started by digging in the North west corner of the trench keeping a 1m baulk between the old trench and the new one which we called L4000. All topsoil in the trench is considered L4000. Right next to the North baulk about .5m away we found a concentration of large pottery sherds with cobbles scattered around it and one large animal ankle bone. After revealing the extent of the pottery we decided it was a pot smash and not a surface as was originally hoped. The dirt above is pot smash is L4001 and the pot smash itself is L4002. We cleaned and photographed L4001 and L4002 then cleared the pottery and rocks.    Further digging in the NW quadrant of the trench (L4000) revealed a small cobble wall running NS extending to about 1.35m long with two levels of cobbles. We dug in all of the areas around the wall looking for additional cobbles and found two cobbles that form something like a corner on the west side of the wall. There are also a few more cobbles on the east side of the wall which may or may not be part of the existing wall.    We dug in NE corner of L4000 and came down on some cobbles that may make up a wall or a system of walls that could be related to the walls found in trench A5 which is adjacent to the NE baulk of this trench. There is a string of cobbles in single file from NE to SW very close to the east baulk. There are also a few cobbles against the E baulk and one against the NE corner with associated pottery sherds. We have not finished looking for the rest of the walls in this area but will do so next week.    We ended the week by digging in the SE corner of the trench in order to open up as much of L4000 as possible. We had been digging very slow up to this point because of the various finds we hit in the top soil. We went to about .10m in a 5m portion of the trench. We will finish moving top soil next week.         ,~: B-4-2001-07-026-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 4,"356,2001-07-26," F-8-2001-07-26 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8000,","   July 26, 2001      0545 hours 80      Begin today by continuing to take down L8001, and when the Northeast corner area of the trench changes and a few rocks appear I change to locus 8003. This new soil has color 10YR 3/3 Dark Brown.   The reasoning behind the locus change at this time lies in the possibility that a surface may be coming up. In the trench directly North a surface was apparently located at this level. We will go slow around this area to see if the floor continues here.   We also worked on removing partial contents of the oven and sifting them, many small bones and egg shells were found employing this process. The measurement taken today after sifting is likely eschew due to the soft material which was inside the oven (within) which makes it appear deeper than by sight.   We continue removing L8001 towards the South baulk and squaring the baulks.    L8004 was opened when a hard packed surface was encountered. It appears that this was possibly where an oven sat at some point in the past and some of the contents or the overheating in close proximity caused coagulation of soil and other unknown materials. We separated the area for individual excavation and collection.         by: Marco A.

We revealed a burial at the beginning of the week that was partially articulated/partially destroyed. Rick cleaned it up for us last Sunday evening. Our next obstacle was L6005 which was an ash pit that cut through a few loci. When we finished scraping that out we started picking-out the remaining loci towards the North Baulk. We turned up some human bones in L6009 and L6011 that we haphazardly dug through. Unfortunately the day they turned up I was running four soundings at one time. Thus, I didn't see the bones until my worker had sufficiently destroyed any would-be burial. We hit a very small mudbrick layer that shows up in the North Baulk profile. This mudbrick was most definitely associated with the human bones that popped out just under and west of the mudbrick. We finished Wednesday the 25th by straightening-out the North Baulk and scraping the floor in the hopes that it would reveal new loci.       Today, we started excavating arbitrary locus 6012. Hasip and I found a stone layer that cuts diagonally through the locus. It runs down into the south profile and it looks like it cuts north through L6003. The stone layer is about 40cm. wide.

We tried to get as much of the trench down to .10m as we could. We worked from South to North but were incredibly slow because of a lack of workman. We finally got some help and were able to dig up an area about 5 x 5 meters. We hurried to shovel as much of the dirt as possible but the area is still to dirty to see the level we stopped at. We hit some more stones here and there and left them in situ to look at later.    We concentrated on big picking instead of following the new walls in the NE part of the trench.

I also took out more of the loose dirt in the sounding looking for the bottom at which there should be an oven. We're almost there. The workman working there left an odd little area sticking out of the baulk. It looks like a little wall, but it's not. I think it was part of the baulk that was not cut completely last year and he didn't want to chop it up. That's why there's an area of higher elevation in the sounding.

Obviously the time was spent on cleaning off the contaminated topsoil that had accumulated during the off season. This trench was opened last year as F-2, but has now been laid out as the corner of a 10 x 10 now renamed F-9.   Since the baulks did have to be cleaned and cut back I remeasured the trench dimensions. The area of the trench has now expanded to 4.25 meters north to south and 4.30 meters east to west. The sounding also had to be scraped back and the fill on the bottom removed. The soundings dimensions are 1.65m x 1.65m. Any artifacts from the sounding cleaning were bagged and given to Andy to look at as the loci are all mixed. L 9000 is the cleaning locus for the trench. Therefore its associated KT's 9000-9005 are contaminated with topsoil.   Next week I will work on redefining loci.

But once all of the administrative/data stuff was taken care of...we were all ready to move some dirt. We focused on L7000, L7005, L7008, and L7009.      L7000 has pretty much been untouched in the southeastern corner of the trench. We took that quarter of the trench down about 15 cms. today. Nothing substantial was found, but we are still in topsoil...so not much of a surprise.      L7005 Rocks!!!! One of the workmen followed surface 7005 southward and found another surface of cobblestones on top of 7005, which is now locus 7010. We are focusing on surface 7010 and following it southward to see what its dimensions are.      L7008 might have been a wannabe surface. We excavated around it today and although there were a few rocks on the same level, Bradley said that it looked like a rock garden. We are going to take down the elevation in the topsoil and sub-topsoil fill loci L7004 and L7000 to the same level as the supposed surface of L7008, so we will see if it is a surface or a rock garden.      L7009 was the other new loci opened yesterday and it clearly looks surface-ish. There is loads of flat lying pottery, bones, and stones. We are just expanding L7009 to find the extent of the surface. Basically today was great and tomorrow will be more excavation and more info!!!      ***Today when elevations were retaken, it became apparent that the southeast elevation has been wrong. It was originally taken on 7/19/01 and as no new excavation has occurred in that area, the mistake was not detected until today. The locus was only topsoil and the elevation, which had originally read 66.35 has been changed to 66.47 on the dayplan.

Got pottery and bone from the fill, plus one odd piece of stone.      In the meantime, a human ulna turned up in the east end of L4000 (very SE corner). Actually looks to be oriented N-S. Moved?

Also found a large chunk of thick, fired clay similar to L5004 but w/o decoration. More of a body piece than a rim.

During this process I have found a beautiful ceramic piece, I will open a new bag for it; that has the kt# 4134.      I am finished with L4027, that is the continuation of L4023 (the floor), I will let my workers sweep it off and then they will clean it. I will open new loci, but the SW corner will have different locus number because its context and structure is much more different then the new surface that is coming up (its locus number is 4029, that equals to L4008 and L4021).      My second goal for today is to get rid off L4022, and to check if the pit is going to the W side of the trench or not. As far as I could see it while I was articulating it (L4028), it was going to W side of the trench, but I am not sure about now. So, that_Ñés why I will try to get it as much deeper as I can to see what' s going on.      Just next to the pit I have found a rock group (it is on the W side of the pit, that has the locus number as 4022). They are very nice I hope them to be a wall, but I am not sure of it. Then just at the same locus again I have found a small circular shape that has plaster around it I hope that it will be an small oven.

This pit is now L 4044. The soil is a dark gray. There seemed to be some chunks of mudbrick in it, but it is very soft and ashy. I closed loci 4038, 4039 and 4040. They have now become all the same type of clayey soil. I melded what was left of them into the new L 4045.   I also took down what was left of L 4041 and part of L 4037 that meets with what was L 4040. The extra space makes it easier to move and work in the trench. That will completely close L 4041 which is now entirely at virgin soil.   After we took off the rest of L 4041 we noticed in the remaining section what looks like an inverted pit. It is under virgin soil and has it on both sides. At first we thought that it might be a tunnel into the oven. It is well under the wall though and Bradley and I don't have any idea what it is.   After scraping the ash pit blossomed in size. It goes up to where L 4041 ended.   We dug about 10cm in the pit. Afterward we leveled the remaining area so it was flat. I didn't quite finish the whole area. The east of L 4045 is hard where it's virgin soil.

However, when I continued digging, I saw that the pelvic girdle and legs were lying flat in the ground. There is a mixture of hard clay and rocks behind the left scapula and humerus which seem to support its contorted position.

We took it down about 5-10 cms. in the entire locus which comprises half of the trench. We have not yet cleaned the area to see if there are any subtle features, but there is one area in the southwestern quarter that greatly resembles the cobblestone surfaces, L7005 and L7010. The entire area (L7004) needs to be examined and analyzed to determine if there needs to be locus adjustments.      I also worked on L7000. We had two objectives: to take down the elevation in the southeastern corner of the trench and to continue exposing the pottery debris of L7009. We accomplished both objectives. There is just about one meter of dirt that is left that needs to be carefully excavated and then the extent for L7009 as far as F-7 is concerned will be known and we will be in the sub-topsoil level in that half of the trench.       The most attention was paid to the northeastern corner of the trench. It was determined today that we only have a few days to get the burial ready for the \bone people\ to excavate before they leave. In order to do this we had to cut into the baulks. We took 25 cms. off of the eastern baulk 1 meter from the northern baulk. We then cut 75 cms. into the northern baulk 1 meter from the eastern baulk. (for visual clarification see enlarged dayplan for 7/29) We named the topsoil layer of this baulk area L7011 and the sub-topsoil layer L7012. We brought the elevation of the baulks down to the cobblestone surface L7005.

In the trench today I have a new worker and two young workers. Aziz is on cement duty today. We began today by emptying and sifting the soil contained within the oven L8002, the plan is to remove all of the remaining soil collecting one bag for flotation (KT# 8040). Soil for flotation is removed after .05 to .10 meters of surface soil has been removed to prevent contamination. The rest of the contents of the oven are sifted and collected as procedure.    At the same time 2 workers continue removing L8003 on North side of the trench where a quantity of pebbles, small stones and pottery pieces begin to emerge.   We also take time after breakfast to articulate and clean-up the circular rock formation L8006 sifting the soil collected from within the area of rocks. As work continues a cobble size rock surface or bottom to the formation appears. As this feature is completely cleaned it appears in my opinion that it was used as suggested earlier, a formation of rocks used to stabilize some sort of container. This is supported by the fact that almost no bone and no ash/carbon was found in association. I am unsure at this point if the formation rested on a floor surface or if it was dug a little into the soil. This is something to be looking for in the next few days. Several pictures of the formation were taken for comparison with photos from yesterday and because it will be removed. We also continue taken the soil towards the East baulk of the trench in the same quadrant as preparation to articulate the other rock formation found earlier L8005.   Meanwhile in L8003 many stones, pottery fragments and bone are found and left in situ to try to expose a surface level as we go.             by: Marco A.

As he did I had one of the guys straightening the baulks. As he did he found a metal awl or needle exactly in the north-west corner of the trench. I gave it KT 9011, but the workmen say it's only a few years old. I suppose this may be, but I made it a small find and I'll turn it into the lab and let them decide. I am pretty far below the top of the trench and it was stuck into the corner of the trench so I think it could be older than 20 years.   I then took down L 9001 by 10 cm. Then I evened that out by taking down L 9002 by 10 cm. We're getting closer to the level of the surface in the sounding, but we still have some of this trashy, fake virgin soil fill to go through.   As I mentioned before we straightened the baulks. The workmen have been digging really straight (down, not across obviously from my day plans) so it's easy to keep track of things in the baulks. I'm particularly trying to do this so I can follow the sounding.   I also worked to help get sandbags between F-7 and F-3. All the intratrench baulks are getting walked on making them very unstable and dangerous.   I also wanted to make a note about yesterdays closing elevations which I took today. The one in the center looks like it grew by 2cm. This is not so crazy. Their digging yesterday kind of bottomed out toward the center of the trench because the corners have been so much higher than the rest of the trench and unfortunately their skills and digging flat are somewhat nonexistent. I managed to get a point in the area that was different yesterday and a little higher than the day before. They're all lower today so never fear.     ,~: F-9-2001-07-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9001,"379,2001-07-29," C-3-2001-07-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,","   July 29, 2001   Today we articulated the area around the stone wall L3005 to see if the wall continues east and the stones that are floating are actually an upper course which has been plowed. I found nothing to indicate the latter but again I will leave the stones until I can bring the eastern part of the trench lower to fully reveal the wall.   I finished revealing L3025 in the NW part of the trench all the way to the north baulk by removing L3018 which is above it. I found that the hard surface continues all the way to the northern baulk but the cobbles do not. I have not separated the cobbles into a separate locus yet because they may be something else than a surface which is stops and a new surface beginning. Also I am not worried about contaminating loci as I am not digging there and I don't plan too until I get the eastern half of the trench down to the same surface. Hopefully there I will find some clues that will help me make loci decisions.   We also leveled and straightened the south part of L3024 in the NE part of the trench to push along with my plan to bring the eastern half of the trench down to the level of L3025. While doing this I more interesting things in the section of the eastern baulk. The pottery seems to have some structure and may be lying on a surface.

I had told my workers not to do anything while I was trying to get my shoots. But they did not listen me and mixed up everything, although Cengiz (one of the foreman's) is with me to take care about the other workers, even though he did the same mistake; he mixed the ceramic pieces from three loci. That made me and Bradley very angry. So, I decided to border the different loci (L4030, L4031, L4032) that they can understand the difference and that they can work more carefully.      By the way in L4022 I have found a second pit that has a round shape, and I gave it a new locus number; 4033. I will take soil sample because it has got to many ash in it, and also on the other the pit has burned edges and stones in, that's why I am opening a new locus.

Afterwards I will take a photo and remove them today.   Also we are digging L4044 to the level of the E part.   In L4024 we found some white chunks as chalk.   In L4044 we found a piece of horse pis brick at the middle (E-W) and next to L4041. We cut a section at the half of the fill to see if there are any surfaces and the soil is very soft. We couldn't see any surfaces or lines.   In L4024 there was a big rock when we took that out there occurred a big hole. So one of the closing elevations of this locus will be from there. The wall was highly disturbed by the rocks or made with the rocks (lower possibility) because the rocks go really deep in the wall (only one row though).

This step contained hard and soft soil that appears to be mudbrick debris from a wall collapse. We had Apo working on this section (yavas, yavas...) He came down on what may be the remnants of a wall oriented north-south. I shaved about 7cm off the north face of 2086 by the east baulk. The soil here was extremely loose and crumbly, even though it was moist (we had not sprayed here since yesterday, by the way). There were lots of animal burrows (and some animal droppings) and root activity in the east part of the step 2086, so maybe the north edge of 2086 is collapse with lots of animal activity also. The baulk shows the lines of the colored stripes we have now cut through, in addition to alternating bands of brown and dark brown closer to the 5m peg (which we think are mudbrick bands). We left the north-south oriented pedestal which we think could hypothetically be a wall and cut towards the east resulting in a little trench between two parts of 2086. This is an artificial trench, I believe (our thanks go to Apo for his creativity). We finished taking 2086 down to the level of the hardest brick material at the base of the collapse debris and left the hard material pedestaled. We took photographs for progress info and moved on to other parts of the trench.       We simultaneously leveled the south end of the trench (except for 2084 and 2076 walls) in order to define our new wall 2087. We took the base of 2054 down to the base level of 2073 adjacent to 2054. Then we took down the area underneath L2079 (formerly an ash splash) calling it 2078 (because it is the same entity [subsurface fill] as 2078 elsewhere in the south end of the trench). We also removed the remains of the mini-baulk as 2078 and bagged the finds in separate KT bags just to differentiate this potentially mixed context from the well-sealed context of 2078 elsewhere in the trench. We troweled flat the area directly beneath the lithics cache and bagged the finds (again in new KT bags) as L2078 [this is sealed context]. We sprayed the leveled off area of the south end of the trench and could see lines indicating two new walls in addition to L2087 which we saw last night. Another wall (L2088) lies between L2087 and L2076. There is also a wall 2089 running north-south leading off from the south edge of 2087. At the south end of this wall 2089 a circular shape in the soil appears to be an oven or maybe a pot smash. We named this circular shape L2090. It should be noted that I pulled some sherds from this exact location yesterday and bagged them as L2078; this does not disrupt the sealed context, but should be taken into consideration when hunting for parts of L2090.       We documented L2076 with several photographs and took off the top 2 courses of bricks in order to level the wall 2076 with the top of wall 2088. This was in order to see how the two walls relate. In fact 2088 and 2076 abut flush against each other. We see bricks of L2088 extending from the east baulk all the way to the west baulk. We also see bricks in 2076 extending from the east baulk all the way to the west baulk, but we have not yet precisely defined the north face of L2076. Wall 2088 is abutted on the south side by L2087, that is as far west as 2087 extends. L2087 appears to be a corner, perhaps, as a long, narrow yellow crumbly looking brick to the west of a square-shaped brown body brick seems to be the last traceable brick in the west part of 2087. L2089-wall appears to abut 2087 on the north side of 2087, making it seem that we could have a corner here. It is most likely that the oven/potsherd/pit entity L2090 at the south edge of 2089 post-dates the walls 2087, 2088, 2089 but may be contemporary with the surface 2081, given the similar elevation of the cobbles that we found at the base of 2073 and the ash pit 2091 stuck in the south baulk.      We redefined L2081 as the surface underneath L2073-hearth (the cobbles indicate a surface) and underneath L2078 (the pit 2091 in the SW corner indicates a surface as well as the spare bits of plaster along the west baulk). We gave the ash pit at the south baulk a name L2091 to differentiate it from the surface 2081 itself. When sprayed, L2091 appears to have a sharp division line separating it from the surface L2081 which it appears to cut. It also appears that L2091 is constructed in part with the same kind of red dense soil with charcoal inclusions that we had in L2062 (as part of hearth 2073).      We also documented L2077 stone collection with photos and removed it, taking it down to the level of the base of L2075. This locus had no pottery but a few small animal bone bits. We removed 11 large cobblestones and left 2 stones in situ, as they are stuck in the cut adjacent to L2074 (and running underneath L2074. This locus (2077) may be part of a stone wall but we decided to remove it now, because we cannot dig in the area of L2080 and L2074 because we have to wait until we can lift the basket impression L2085. Therefore our progress would be stalled in the second 5m long trench-step because we need to work from the top to the bottom and come down on surface L2049 in the process.       We closed down 30min early so I could document the new loci and will in all likelihood keep the trench closed tomorrow through Thursday (July 31-August 2) because duty calls me to Diyarbakir and Baris to Debbie-Tepe.      ,~: A-2-2001-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,"387,2001-07-30," D-5-2001-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5008,","   July 30, 2001      The first part of the day was spent working on the cluster of ovens (L5033, 5036, 5048) in the central-E, trying to figure out their associations. First, we pulled all their pottery linings out, to avoid contaminating them when we brought their pedestals down.   L5028, which abuts wall L039 and L5036 is cut into, was brought down so that it was flush with L5039. It looks like there might be a surface association between this lower part of L5028 with wall L5039 and surface L5034. The wall may lay upon the surface somewhat and divide it. Either way, the oven is cutting down into it from a later surface.   L5033 is less clear, as the part of E-baulk hugging L5022, is simply fill.   L5048, on the other hand, clearly cuts wall L5039.   My guess is that the three ovens are contemporary as their style is similar (round, pottery-lined) and they all have the same approximate bottom level. Unfortunately, they were not all caught at the same level, so comparing top levels isn't feasible. Hopefully the pottery reading of their linings will show all to be similar.   The latter part of the day was spent trying to find the continuation of S, SW-NE wall L5045, by removing much of the fill in the southern part of the trench (L5044). No dice, unfortunately, even after spraying.   Also, work was done to remove NW wall L5037 now that it's thoroughly documented to see what other data we can pull out of it. The far NW area, which was to ridden with animal burrows to trace the mudbrick in, came off in very nice mudbrick pieces, which affirmed the assessment of the wall. Notably, the wall does not appear to go any deeper than surface L5034, but is not all built upon the ash layer L5047 which is under L5034.   The final portions of southern SW-NE wall L5008 were also removed.     ,~: D-5-2001-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5008,"388,2001-07-30," F-8-2001-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8002,","   July 30, 2001      0540 hours 73 F       Day begins in 3 fronts. L8004 which was believed to have been some type of hard surface, while it showed areas of hard soil most of it was not hard. Because of its location in relation to the oven (L8002) and to the circular rock formations (L8005-8006) I wonder if this was simply a dumping ground for liquid contents from the pot or the oven, these contents if mixed with oil or other cooking mixtures could have caused the hardening of the soil. We found some teeth and other small bones within. It also could have been a section of a collapsed wall, although we found no other similar sections at the same level. In all L8004 is of unknown origin and its depositional history is unclear at this time.    L8003 continues to be removed and the cluster of rocks is still being defined. The L8005 circular rock formation is also being cleaned and articulated within the area of rocks with the plan of removing and sifting it for materials.   Later we continue to move across the trench in an North direction removing L8003, the plan here is to slowly come down on the possible level or surface on which the oven L8002 is sitting on. At this time I have also delimited an area of one meter on each side of the oven and one meter in front to isolate the area while taking out the remaining L8003 before I decide what to do, or how to go about approaching the possible surface below.   Again photos were done today as articulation of L8005 was in progress and after it was cleaned. As we take the soil below it out, these formations (L8005-6) will have to be displaced.       by: Marco A.

It is now L3029, a fill layer above a known surface. The known surface that we are aiming for is a lighter colored surface which the pottery seen in the north section of L3029 is lying on. This is a few cm above the locus found the other day L3027. As we dug into this locus from the north we found pieces of what looked to be oven fragments and then a feature running south made out of the same material as an oven. At first we thought that we had a very large oven but as we followed it we found that it turned sharply east at a right angle into the baulk. I am not sure now that it is an oven. We are finding flecks of carbon in the dirt around the feature which could mean it was used in oven related contexts. Also just outside the oven feature we found an 8 cm long, 1/2 cm wide metal pin KT3239. It could be a small hair pin or a pin to a fibula. The feature is L3030, the area outside it is L3031 and the area inside it is L3032. I closed L3029 as we have reached a definable surface.   We also started taking out the feature L3015 which is just south of L 3031. We are taking it out slowly because the slag in it looks to have been put on it when it was wet and it flowed between the spaces between the rocks. The way to see if this is true is to take off the rocks slowly and see if there is any physical connection between the slag parts and to see if it has adhered to the sides of the rocks. So far it looks as if the slag once touched but the connection has been broken by animal burrows.      ,~: C-3-2001-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,"391,2001-07-30," B-4-2001-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 4/Locus 4000,","   July 30, 2001   Trench B4      I was not in the trench for the first few hours of the morning, I left bags for the workers to uncover the rest of the stones laying under the section between L4000 and L4003 at the cobble stones.

I hoped we had a cobble surface or perhaps a floor in a courtyard but the cobbles do not continue on the East side of the original wall in L4003. Right now it looks like there are at least 2 different walls possibly intersecting.    In the NE corner of L4003 we also peeled back a few centimeters of earth and found tops of several more cobbles.    I started chopping away the mud brick collapse in the center of the trench. I changed this area to L4006 from L4000 and called it mudbrick collapse. We found no other cobbles in this area. There were a few flat pieces of pottery at the North end but it does not look like surface.

Because they do not have a continuation. But, I will open a new locus for it.      On the other hand two of the workers are on L4032; they are cleaning it up and they will sweep it off, and then I will take some photos of the clean locus.

Besides this, L4031 I have found a nice rock road, they are arranged in an symmetrical way, the length of the road is 90cm, and the wide is 80cm. But is very beautiful.

Just then I got really shocked because, it was so nice to sense and to have many questions in mind, because there might to be too many answers to them; such a nice day full of brain storming. The third thing that was interesting today was to see the edges of the road and to see how the rocks were twisting in the corner.      I have a mixture of ceramic pieces that are coming up from L4031(the above part of road, mud brick wall, and the huge rocks at the SW side of the trench).

There's a slight chance that after a break it continues in its original orientation (SW-NE) but that's a less than safe bet.   In other news, that sandy/clay material that was abutting wall L5039 and some of L5028 (L5038) was removed today. It was relatively unremarkable save that it was only a few cm thick and formed a perfect corner at its SE-most extent, and the line which may be related to L5045 can be traced to that corner.   The problem right now is the huge glut of \maybes and possiblies\ accumulating in the trench and the almost complete lack of answers. Compound this by the fact that the northern architecture may(!) be related to the southern architecture so I can't remove it and the trench can be very frustrating and finding pieces of excavation to do which could reveal answers but probably won't destroy anything is nigh impossible. Thus, at the end of the day we cut two large sections (E-W) in the center of the trench and slightly S of there to try and figure out what's going on and minimize damage.

The slag there does seem to be flowing downwards as there is a 5-7 cm difference from start to bottom. Also in several places it has congealed to the feature stones meaning this slag was put on top of the feature after the feature was put down.

I took a soil sample from one of the rocks in the southern areas and once the dirt was in the sun (and not under the blue tarp) I could see that a small portion of the soil was covered with a very thin bluey black layer., This was totally invisible previously. I wonder whether this isn_Ñét the same blue tinge noted last year. The blue shade was then immediately changed out for a white one which will be erected on 2 August 2001.       If this feature goes under 2072 then it is obviously earlier than the wall. It is however possible that the small stones were either placed there to cover up a soft ash area or fell from the later wall and were deposited above the or ashy material.

Though a possible mortar line did show up in the far west of L5053, it is not consistent with the orientation of any other wall-type feature remaining in the trench (NW-SE). However, the area of southern fill locus 5044 does not show the line continuing, so either the line is aberrant or some other type of feature, or the feature it is associated with remains deeper in the trench. The S section of L5053 also showed that what was previously thought to be a \perfect corner\ in the sandy material of L5038 was actually improperly diagnosed as the material was on a slope and continues eastward, though at a lower level. The edge to the S, however, does seem accurate.   NW pit L5047 was excavated today, it contained mostly ash fill with some loose soil. The pit undercuts the western remainder of L5038 and some of the remainder of L5037 so that will need assessed for possible work with digging those loci tomorrow. I'm also not completely confident we have the pit properly outlined at the moment, because one of my workers took the initiative to straighten the sections of my pit for me, which, had it been almost any other locus would have been good, but not in this case. He also flattened the bottom a little before he gained my attention. Thankfully, the pit is up against the western baulk, so no real harm was done as any discrepancies between the remainder of the pit and its actual dimensions will be visible there.   Finally, a portion of thin, loose, stacked layers of clay/silt (imagine water gathering and depositing the stuff as it evaporates) was removed from the W-center of the trench (L5054). The area had been originally thought of as ashy, but that was inaccurate.     ,~: D-5-2001-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,"412,2001-08-01," A-6-2001-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6000,","   Aug. 1, 2001   Removing 10 cm or so from the last 6 m of the trench. Very little bone or lithic. Quite a bit of pottery throughout the area. Exposed more of the rocks in L6002. Now looks as if they were deliberately quarried or something gives the cross-hatching in/on them. Several other large fragments are of the same material. Different from the river rolled cobbles. Also found a doughnut shaped piece of stone from the southeast corner of the trench.    The distribution of large rocks is beginning to suggest rock wall boundaries or fall. L6001 now looks a little like the feature in Elvan's trench.   Also, the small area of rock is gone. Nothing exists subsurface as the seeds exposed have been removed. All likelihood, deposited by ants, removed by ants.   After removing another 10 cm or so fo fill, the picture with L6002 has definitely changed. Those rocks associated with the top of the  \ (going N-S) now look to be independent of those going E-W. All of the E-W rocks are now considered part of L6006. 6002 rocks all share a similar level of origin (to which they sit), were removed by day's end. L6006 rocks were often mud layer and embedded more deeply. The same is still true for L6001. L6006 and 6001 look like they may form a continuous rectilinear structure, with positions still buried in the north sidewall. Accordingly, the fill within this area has also been given a new locus (L6005) seperate from L6000 fill.   A new burial was found under L6002 at the east end (directly under the 3 larger rocks). Burial now looks to have the head under the rock and lie E-W (head to east, feet to west, but tough to tell).      ,~: A-6-2001-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6000,"413,2001-08-01," C-3-2001-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,","   August 1, 2001   Today we concentrate again on the SE part of the trench. We dug L3033 which is the entire upper area 4.5 m west of the east baulk and 6 m north of the south baulk not including the oven feature L3030 or its fill L3032 at the NE corner of the area. We dug it almost completely off except for a small 75 cm by 75 cm square in the SE corner. This was a fill above a surface, L3027, and comprised of somewhat loosely pact dirt that contained some small plaster bits. It also contained several carbon samples KTs 3280 an3282 and some small carbon samples that were too small for sampling. Underneath L3033 is the surface that we have been aiming for, L3027. This is a work surface with some scattered cobbles on it. I don't believe that the cobbles are intentionally put there to make a surface because they are in isolated areas with no connection. The cobbles are river stones just like the other cobble surfaces we have but at this point they look to be the trash stones left behind when cutting river conglomerate into bricks to use in architecture which we have seen in other parts of the site. We catalogued the surface and started digging it bringing up the next locus L3034. We did not finish cutting through L3027 today. L3027 remains 1.5 m W from the E baulk and 1.5 m W of the NS running wall of the oven feature. Today we also pressed down a bit around and in the stone wall L3005 to see if it as a second row. I am almost positive it doesn't have a second row on account that they are on about a 15 cm pedestal.

Because the floor is touching the rocks. It is really magnifying...      On the other side of the trench two of my workers are removing the soil, the dirt in L4034, this part of the trench is interesting too. Because, I have found a group of ceramics on it that are just next to the pit which has the locus number as 4028.

As we did the soil became looser and more loamy. It was also somewhat softer to dig in and not as hard packed. I made this new area L 9005. As we scraped further out from that the area became full of ash. This new very ashy area became L 9006. This follows the line of the sounding. There was a thicker deposition next to the north baulk that slanted up thinner toward the center of the trench so we hit the ash in the center sooner. Before I'd defined the boundaries of the new L 9006 loci and the old L 9005 loci pottery from L 9006 got into the pottery bag for L 9005, so KT 9044 is contaminated.   After that we spent time pushing the L 9006 back to its southern boundaries. There has been some flat laying pottery which I left in the ground, but I don't think it's a surface.   I also had workmen push L 9005 down to see if we could get through it and reach the ash layer. We're almost there.

In addition, the surrounding area was scraped once more.   Rather than getting an answer to the question, \Where does this wall go?\ we rather got an answer to the question, \Why can't we figure out where this wall is going?\ It now appears there is a large (circular, ~ 80 cm diameter) pit or oven immediately to the N of SW oven L5029 and probably cutting a fair portion of wall L5045, which I am leaning to thinking ends, or rather, corners, not too far into the trench and this new pit cuts the western portion whereas a large root path muddles interpretation of the east.   Meanwhile, now that all the old loci (related to previous features like floor L5034 in the north and whatnot) have been documented, I started hacking things down to try and get most of the trench (save soundings L5052, 5053 and NE and E portions of the trench which have been dug a little deeper) to the same level and extremely flat to see what has been missed. In most likelihood, I'll have to do some serious re-assignment of loci in the next couple of days. In any event, loci 5038, 5051, 5034 and 5044 were all chopped down today and though the work wasn't finished at shutdown time there are already some soil color/texture results appearing.   Finally, a second look was taken at NW pit L5047, and a good thing, too, because in one portion the ash pit continues down a meter, possibly more, containing extensive pottery and bones. However, the shape is very irregular with many strange undercuts of harder material (some due to roots) so I'm not completely sure what is happening there and hope to consult one of the directors tomorrow about it.   The first part of tomorrow will likely be spent finishing the scraping and cleaning job, followed by a spray down and some loci reassignment, other work pending on that.     ,~: D-5-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,"425,2001-08-02," F-1-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1028,","   August 2, 2001      We began the day by going down 3-4 cm in the pit locus L1036. As we were doing this we came upon many very impressive pieces of pottery. The problem with these pottery pieces is that the largest are stuck into the baulk, and could not be removed without cutting a hole into the baulk. I would need permission from Bradley to do this, so I don't know if it will happen, but even if it doesn't I can remove the smaller pieces and leave the large pieces in the baulk. This morning we also went down in L1028, the area east of the pit locus about 5 cm, the better to understand what exactly is going on in this area.   As our trench is about 4.18 by 4.56 and there is a huge wall that takes up over half of the trench that we want to leave in situ for now, our options for what to do in the trench are actually quite limited, since we know we can't dig the wall, so we dig near the wall. Here are some of the things we did for the rest of the day:   We decided that the hard clay surface needed to go, it just needed to go. This was the surface or bottom of L1031, the oven and also of L1036, the pit. The clay surface is about 1.6 by 0.7 meters, and very crusty. This clay surface was very hard and almost impossible to trowel down on, but when you troweled at it it would pop off as though it were a crust. This job was just completed by the end of the day, so we will see if we can see anything new tomorrow.   L1034, the fill locus to the west of L1033 the large wall, had half of it taken down 20 cm, a small sounding if you will, to see what we could see if we looked at the wall sideways, and also to see what else was going on in this area. We were able to finish this job, but once again did not have time to analyze it completely, as the day ended as we were finishing this up.   One final note that I have not put in the  pages of the last day is that in L1032, the locus next to the pit L1036, there appear to be mudbricks running in a diagonal direction from north, whereas the rest of the bricks in the trench, the ones in the large wall, have run perpendicular to the north. These bricks are interesting also because they appear to run diagonal up the baulk. I do not know how this relates to anything at this time.     ,~: F-1-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1028,"426,2001-08-02," F-1-2001-08-02-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,","   August 2, 2001   Week 5 Weekly Summary      The most important feature of the week was the locus L1033, what we tend to call the Wonder Wall. This is a large mudbrick surface 3 meters by 3 meters that we believe may be a wall. We hope that we will be able to define exactly whether it is a wall or a large pavement within the next week. We have begun a small sounding area in L1034, the area abutting the mudbricks, to go down 40 cm or until we reach something interesting. We are doing this so that we can see the bricks in profile on the side to see if we can see any courses, as well as to determine once and for all whether there are more than just one course, which would indicate that it is a wall, or whether it only has one course, in which case it would be a pavement.   We found a large pot smash in L1036, which we gave KT# ----, which was probably the best find of the week. Much of our digging in this trench has been fundamentally different from the digging in almost every other trench on the site, as there are very few pottery fragments in the layers that we excavate. This pit gave some pottery fragments, and the actual pot smash was large, filling up a large plastic bag. I appreciated this pot smash. I have hope that in the coming days we may find a black ashy layer which may also give some pot smashes and pottery.    We also spent the week removing walls around the large wall or pavement to try to better understand how the large wall interacts with the surrounding loci. We were able to remove both L1029, a wall with only one course which almost seems like a curb to L1033, as well as L035, the oven wall, which cut into the L1033. Removing these walls did not really help us understand the area any better, but it was a good idea. Interestingly enough, the black line that seemed to mark the edge of the two sides of the wall of the oven seemed to continue underneath the actual wall. I don't know what to make of that, as dark black burn lines seem to go around and underneath stuff in almost every area of the trench, and it is really confusing.   Our plan of action for the coming week is to define where the wall or pavement is, and then hopefully either leave it in and dig around it, or take it out if it is a pavement.      ,~: F-1-2001-08-02-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,"427,2001-08-02," F-7-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,","   August 2, 2001   Area F   Trench 7   Katie Smith      Today we started by cleaning the entire trench. After the whirlwind excavation of 8/1, there was a lot of left-over dirt, so we all worked on that.      I started working on L7018. I cleaned all of the pottery and then took locus photos. I did not actually start excavating it until after breakfast. As it turns out, there was not a surface directly beneath the pottery debris, but another debris layer. I closed L7018 and opened L7023. I do think that we area getting closer to the elusive surface because there area a larger number of cobbles interspersed with the pottery in this layer.      We took down the North 1/4 of L7020 by 10-15 cms. The workmen cleaned the area, but I did not get a chance to look at it and see if there is anything substantial in that area.      The time invested in cleaning the trench did turn up some new interesting features. First, there seems to be cobbles and pebbles to the South of L7023 which would bode well for the continuation of a surface underneath the pottery debris. Unfortunately, I did not have extra time to look at the area thoroughly so I do not know how extensive those pebbles/cobbles are and I did not name it as a new locus. (tomorrow!!!)      I did however name two new loci in the NW area of the trench. Both of them are pits. The first was found right on the edge of the locus boundary between L7019 and L7020. Issan excavated a portion of the pit which turned up a jawbone of a cow. This pit was named L7021. I photoed the bones in situ and then collected them under KT# 7132. The other pit was identified to the NW of L7021 but not excavated. I named this pit L7022.      The only other thing to note from today is that L7019 was not excavated, but it produced KT bags because there was so much cleaning to do in that area.        ,~: F-7-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,"428,2001-08-02," C-3-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,","   August 2, 2001   Today in the morning I identified a pit coming out of the E baulk 1.25 cm south of the E-W running wall of the oven feature L3030 which cuts L3027. We dug it finding that it had a little ash in it. This pit was right below the stone L3015 feature that we took out a couple of days ago. This could be a part of the stone circle in the above mentioned feature and probably was as it is directly below where the stone circle was.   We cut most of L3027 away at parts all the way to the eastern baulk when I saw that there was a surface line where we had just cut. I had my workers slow down and investigate the remaining parts of L3027. I found that there was a coherence in the cobbles and that it really was a cobble surface but it had been degraded in places which had led me to my earlier conclusion. Also while articulating the oven L3003 in the south of L3027 and L3034 I saw that 3027 may be the surface that the oven was put on. I am going to wait on investigating that area until tomorrow when I will have morning light. Next to the oven L3003 some stones poked through the top of newly exposed L3034, the locus underneath L3027. It might later reveal a N-S running wall. In the northern part of the L3027 and L3034 it looked like the soil was changing near the oven feature and so I stopped digging there in order to try to define a pit line which I have not been able to do yet.    Lastly continued to articulate the stone wall L3005 in order to remove the now severely pedestaled rocks to its west. I will wait until tomorrow to take out the rocks as to wait for the north most part to be articulated.     ,~: C-3-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,"429,2001-08-02," D-5-2001-08-02-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,","   Week 5 Summary--Week ending August 2, 2001      Whereas last week was occupied with cutting down the trench to confirm or disprove our theories about what lay above, this week was about cutting the trench down to what lies beneath. Unfortunately, we only had one real guide to what we might find, a SW-NE mudbrick (very well preserved where we found it) wall coming out of the south baulk (L5045). All this week was spent trying to find various ways this feature may connect to other ones, and alas, didn't. This was confounded by the presence of areas of sand and loose silt/clay fill resembling the remains of water building up against walls and evaporating (L5038 and L5054, respectively) which had seemed to indicate there might be a large architectural feature along the entire trench (which there still may be, but it's not clear yet). Whatever is going on in the trench, it does not to be appear to be similar in form to what was above it.    Some sense does appear to be coming from wall L5045, in that it now seems it goes a short distance into the trench (~ 1.5 m) then comes to a T. This is not a final decision on the matter, though, as an oven on the W (no locus yet) and a large root scar on the E confound full understanding of the wall.   Otherwise, interesting, though at this time inconclusive soil texture and color differences are appearing about the trench. However, more digging will probably be required to understand their contexts.   Finally, a deep ( &gt; .5 m) ash pit (L5047) is being excavated in the NW corner which was sealed by surface L5034 and wall L5039 and is producing some nice pottery and bones. It also brings the grand total of trench corners occupied by pits to 3. I will be digging in the NE corner to find the pit that symmetry demands be there sometime next week.     ,~: D-5-2001-08-02-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"430,2001-08-02," F-8-2001-08-02-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8002,","   Aug. 2, 2001   Week 5 Summary      Interesting this week is the finding of three circular rocks formations, they are located in the Southeast quadrant L8005, the Southwest quadrant L8006, and the Northwest quadrant L8009. At first it was supposed that they were perhaps signs of pits or ovens, but as their articulation and removal took place it became more possible that they were in effect places for round containers such as large pots and were laid horizontally to place the pot on, and rocks -which were mostly flat- were added to the sides to help stabilize them. It looks like they were of the same type of usage and origin. They are at very similar elevations.    The rest of the trench shows no additional sign of habitation or any type of architecture at this point. The oven L8002 was emptied of almost all of its contents but the walls were preserved for now.    A couple of promising areas are 2 areas of small pebbles with bits of pottery which have begun to appear. One of this contains Type 95 pottery dating to the third millennium.    We also removed the larger cobbles at the North end of the trench mostly on the Northeast quadrant, nothing additional was found under them.

A few minutes into work this morning two of my young workers were sent off to alleviate worker saturation and the heavy influx of young workers we have been getting. Ahh the politics of the tepes!   We begin working on leveling the trench; the plan to follow today is to complete that work while carefully continuing to look to support the first indices of a small surface or wall in the middle of the trench. I will be plotting at 4/1 (0.20 meters  1 meter) the rock circles before taking them out.   After plotting the 3 circular formations we leveled the area of L8005-8006 looking for contents below the rocks. These contents were given separate locus #s. This was done since there is a good possibility of sealed conditions, even though I think that this fill is really the same as that found in L8007.   Not much attention was given today to the possible surface or wall in the middle... other things came up. But, it was given a new and separate locus number of 8016.

For instance the mud brick wall, and the pebbled way or a part of a road that is standing just next to it.      Besides these I was planning to get rid off the baulks of D3, but Bradley wanted me to keep it as a guide for stratigraphical evidences, so I did not take the baulks off, but I have articulated them. On the other hand I have found a second pit that was surrounded with plaster (that has the depth of 40cm, and had an ashy layer).      As I have mentioned before the floor that has three different loci (L4030, L4031, L40320) and later on, in two days L4031 changed to be L4034, L4035, L4036 and L4037. That L4034 is the pebbled way, L4035 is the mud brick wall, L4036 is the surface under the huge against rocks with the L4037.      I cleaned the trench and swept the whole dirt off that it will be ready for the spider shoots. But, because of the sun light we could not take the spider shoots, and I had to close up for today.     ,~: D-4-2001-08-02-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4,"433,2001-08-02," C-2-2001-08-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2071,","   August 2, 2001   For my first day back in C2 we started out by drawing a more detailed day plan. We then opened two new loci: L2081, which is defined as the removal of the stones from the wall of L2046; and L2082, which is defined as the removal of the stones overlying the pit of L2079. After taking down 2081, each of the two courses separately, we noticed that the wall had been founded on an ashy surface which contained pottery, animal bones, slag, a possible netweight, and shell. We then took down the surface about 2cm, cleaned, and took photos. With L2082 we removed the stones on top of the pit. Pottery, animal bones, shell, riverrock, and two grinding stones were found.

We didn't finish taking down the whole area by the end of the day so we'll straighten the lines tomorrow and see if it can become part of the ash of L 9006.   We took out the pottery that had been lying flat in L 9006. The workmen had pedestaled some of it, but I took pictures anyway to show how extensive the flat lying areas were. I put all this flat lying stuff into a new bag KT 9052.   After we took out the pottery and leveled the areas that had been pedestaled we pushed further in L 9006 until we hit the southern borders. We took it down around 10cm there at the end.   I also took down around 10cm what was left of L 9002.

A little additional fill was removed in the southwest area of the trench and clarified the situation with L5008. This feature is now a course of rock which takes a sharp turn along the north sidewall and heads southwest toward Area B. A small concentration of rock (L5009) remains in the northwest corner of the L5000 trench and is separate from L5008. Both of these features need to be followed out and articulated with the materials in Area B and elsewhere to determine their extent and to identify what they are (linear walls, outlines of room blocks, etc.).

We did this to try to better understand the relationship between the large wall and the diagonal bricks. We went down about 10 cm, making it level with the locus L1034, the locus next to it. Not much was found in this area, and at this elevation it appears to be merely fill, nothing vital was chopped down.   We next spent a good part of the morning straightening baulks, as our baulks had gotten to be unwieldy and it was becoming increasingly difficult to pick up features, bricks, etc. in the baulk. We spent over an hour straightening baulks and making sure that the plum bob dropped down straight and hung without hitting the baulks.   We next began digging down in our mini sounding in the L1034 in the far northwest corner of the trench. We had taken down the area 15 cm yesterday in an attempt to see if anything was going on in relation to the large wall locus L1033, and also to see if we could catch the wall in section. Today we decided to go down another 25 to make it an even 40. However, on the first big pick pass of the day Erdal threw in his pick and took it out with a fine black ash on it. At this point we decided to go down the distance of the first pick pass, only about 8 cm, and then clean up to see what exactly was going on with this dark black ash. After we cleaned up the area we were left with a large black ash layer, maybe a pit, maybe a black surface, with some yellow streaks in it. This new surface, layer, whatever it is, is fascinating. We started a new locus, as this was an obvious change in the dirt, from relatively hard brown to dark black ash. This new locus is L1037.   Oh, we also went down about 5 cm in L1028. Not much going on there at this time as it still appears to be fill.

We decided to take down 10-15 cms. of elevation in the SE corner of the trench in L7020. In doing so, we found a few interesting things. Right away Meke found a very interesting pottery sherd. It looks like a long spout and B. Parker's initial assessment was that it was an Uruk period drooping spout. Andy came by and we actually found some other pieces that fit together with the spout. I KT'd the assemblage separately under KT#7143. Issan also found some medium-sized stones that were flat and looked like they have been \worked\ by humans. They were not basalt, but they are possibly grindstones. They are to be found in the lithics bag from L7020 under KT#7141. The other bag thing that we found was what appears to be another surface and perhaps a related surface to L7010 and all of the pottery debris layers. The area is composed of cobbles and some flat-lying sherds. It lies perpendicular to L7023 and was named L7024 today.      L7023 was the other locus that we worked with today. We cleared off the pottery in that locus and closed it when we found...ANOTHER LAYER OF POTTERY DEBRIS! This layer was named L7025. It is more distinct than the other layers due to the increased presence of small cobbles. This leads me to believe that we are getting closer to the surface.      The last area we worked on was in L7015. We were trying to reduce the fill and follow the surface L7010 into the pottery debris layers. We were not able to find the surface, but I think it is a good possibility that we are still above it.         ,~: F-7-2001-08-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7005,"448,2001-08-03," D-5-2001-08-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,","   August 3, 2001      Today was a short day because it was the Islamic holy day so we had to let our workers leave early to get to their midday prayers. I was extremely tired, though, so I didn't mind too much.   Anyhow, for the day I had my workers cut the entire northern portion of the trench level, as all the architecture and surfaces had been removed in the previous two days. In some areas this meant taking the soil, which for vast majority of the area (L5054) was soft fill with some pottery and occasional ash, but very little bone or lithics. From my first look at the fully cleaned area at the end of the day it appears that much of the area is either very soft fill, though more brown than the gray/blue soil that had been above, with charcoal inclusions. My guess at the moment is that either there is some large pit or group of pits in the area, or possibly build-up behind a large wall, or maybe even a large destruction layer. The latter, though we'll have to see about further evidence for that later, might explain the layers of accumulated sand and clay/silt build-up above the current level as there may have been a prolonged period of non-use following the destruction.   As for the south, I was going over the area with a fine-toothed comb (trowel) to try and make some more sense of the area. My only real worry about the area is that I may never make sense of SW-NE wall L5045, because though it is good going into the S-baulk, if it corners (which I think it does), the place it would hit the E or W section is confounded stratigraphically by a pit or oven. If it doesn't corner, then it quickly gets lost. Either way, my plan for the area is the same, excavate the oven on the W side of the wall (L5055) then slowly bring the whole area down until I'm confident the wall is pedestled, and then take it out.     ,~: D-5-2001-08-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,"449,2001-08-03," F-9-2001-08-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9003,","   August 3, 2001      I started by trying to get a section on L 9003 the hard white clay area. Although it has a clay correlation in the baulk I don't see that it's a wall. The white part is very thin, only about 4cm or so and underneath is the huge ash layer we knew would be coming up.   We then started on the brownish dirt L 9005. It looks like we hit the ash in the northern strip, but it extends further south along the west baulk so we're following that to try and get it all out and close the locus. That way I can take down the whole ash area another 10cm and not have to worry about contamination. We took off about 5cm.   I opened L 9007 today, but it appears retroactively on the day plans starting July 31, 2001. When I took off L 9001 there was the same fake virgin soil on either side of the hard white clay area L 9003. Originally I had left these flanking sides both as L 9001. They shouldn't have been left as the same area as they were separated by a new locus. Since I didn't really dig to the south of L 9003, only scraped a little I made this southern piece L 9007. I closed L 9001 on August 2, 2001 as I had dug out the northern area that was marked L 9001.   I got almost hopefully all of L 9005, the brownish dirt north and west of the ash layer removed completely. I then started to take down L 9006.

In L2082 another soil sample was taken, this time of the soil in the pit itself. Carbon was found and sampled. Also found was a rock with iron pyrite in it. After breakfast we found some stones which had lain below the conglomerate stone on the surface. Another carbon sample was taken and more iron pyrite was found.   L2083 was dug to see what was there. A couple of centimeters down a surface appeared. The surface was trowelled and brushed for better definition.   Special care is being taken with L2084, a pit believed to be the remnant of a metal working pit. This assumption is based on the recovery of some slag.

Recall from week 2: expansion of trench (L.1036) was made under incorrect impression burial would be an infant. Lower legs were left at the time to insure best preservation of total skeleton. Excavation of overburden over legs while upper portions were exposed would have endangered them. Amy finished removing the lower legs on 8/4.      Couple of burials struck in last two days (naturally) have spread some doubt over our assessment that cemetery was strictly Islamic. These burials are: A3 L.3002, and A7 L. 7002. Each of these burials runs counter to Islamic burial tradition. A3 L. 3002 is oriented N of E, compared to other burials, and appears to be out of position. A7 L. 7002 has its head to the south. A third burial, A6 L. 6007, appears to run below an architectural feature, L. 6002, leading us to question whether all burials were deposited in area exclusively devoted to cemetery.

In that time, an 8x2m trench was opened up continuing east from the L4008 spur of A4. Unlike other trenches in the area A, this one was relatively shallow (25-50cm below ground surface) owing to time constraints and the presence of rock architecture.      In the end, Area 6 produced three distinct rock alignments. Two of these, L6006 and L6001, appear to be walls or foundations. Given the way that L6006 turns in the trench, it looks as if they may form a continuous structure of which part remains buried in the north sidewall. Another locus was also assigned to the fill bordered by these two features (L6005), although none of it was removed.      L6001 and L6006 are also similar in composition. While both contain a number of river-rolled cobbles and flagstones, they also have two or more large, rectilinear boulders of white or greyish white stone. L6006 also has at least three boulders which have gouged furrows or cross-hatching on them. They may be quarry marks, though this is pure supposition on my part. These rocks also appear to be somewhat softer than the other large stones in either feature.      The third rock alignment was an east-west trending line of stones which branched off of L6006 (L6002). Although these two features abut, L6002 sits higher than L6006 (has a higher level of origin). By the end of the week, the single exposed course of L6002 had been removed, while L6002 remained. The exact nature/function of this feature is unknown, but there were two points of interest. One was the presence of several large pieces of weak sandstone or conglomerate in the center of the line. The second is a burial which was located immediately below the three large stones at the east end of the feature (L6004).       Both this burial and burial L6007 occur in the floor of the trench at a relatively shallow depth below ground surface and may be quite late. The orientation of either is somewhat nebulous, but L6007 at least appears as if it might be laid out facing north-south. Like burial L7002, this would make it an oddity, especially since all the other near surface burials are aligned east-west. The proximity of each of these to other nearby features (particularly L6004) holds some promise for sorting out a sequence of internment. Because they occur at such shallow depths, there is also the possibility that other burials exist in the same area. Since the east edge of the site occurs only a short distance from the end of the trench, little room exists for additional burials or other features in that direction.       Final Summary Part 2 (Amy Stevens)   Aug. 20, 2001   Work was started again in trench A6 on Aug. 12, 2001. Work was done on two loci: L6007 and L6001. There had originally been excitement about L6007 because it had a bone appearing to be a humerus which seemed to lie north-south. This would make its direction different from the other burials excavated in the A trenches this season. This burial turned out to be a pile of bones, with not all bones present. So it was a different burial in that it was possibly a secondary burial although most bones were missing.    L6001 was of very special interest because rather than being a wall it turned out to be a cist tomb. We're assuming that the cist burial was dug into a pit because the soil directly above it was a different color than the soil surrounding it.    The fact that it was a cist tomb definitely made it different from the other burials in that it was the first burial from this and last season with an actual tomb. Also, according to our compass grid it was lying with the head on the southwest side unlike 5 out of the 6 tombs I excavated this season which had the head on the west side. There was one (Trench A3 L3002) with the head on the southwest side but it had no tomb.   An interesting note about the burial L6010 (inside of L6001) was that the upper half of the skeleton (all bones superior to the pelvic girdle) was still articulated but the bottom half of the skeleton, including the left forearm, had been laid in a pile at the foot of the tomb and there was a large rock cutting half the width of the tomb, separating the head and foot of the tomb. The bones laid at the bottom were in very good condition in that they were mostly whole and had few fractures and breaks.    The fact that there are piled bones at the foot of the grave raises the question as to whether this was a secondary burial. My opinion is that it was not because the upper half of the skeleton is all in place, still articulated, and very good condition, suggesting it was placed there when the person died and has been undisturbed. The vertebrae, for example, were in better shape than any of the burials I've seen this season. Possibly the bones were moved some time after the interment of the body took place. The best explanation I can think of for the placement of the lower bones is the possibility that the tomb was robbed, and some of the bones were disturbed and then moved to a pile afterwards.    We found no grave goods in this tomb. It is somewhat common to find grave goods in cist tombs from the Roman Period and Early Bronze Age. We can assume that this burial is not from either of these periods considering that its stratigraphic level is too high to be Bronze Age and Roman cist tombs were typically cut into rock rather than dug in pits.   A final note about this burial is that we were in a hurry to find out whether or not there was a body within the rocks when we took the top rock off. While digging in the soil under the top rock we put a very minor gouge in the skeleton's face. We weren't concentrating on watching for differences in the soil as we dug down but did notice the dirt inside was softer than outside of the tomb. The face of the skeleton was only a few centimeters under the layer of dirt.   These two burials, L6010 and L6007, were on opposing sides of the trench, approximately 2 meters apart. It is interesting to note that there was only a centimeter difference between the elevation on top of the bones of L6007 and the top of the rocks of the tomb L6001. Since there is no direct stratigraphic association documented between these two features we can only speculate whether or not there was a time period relationship between when these two burials were dug.   The side walls of the tomb, L6010, still remain, we only removed rocks overlying the side wall. The tomb is obviously empty now with the lowest elevation being 99.78. I dug a little deeper in the tomb after the skeleton had been excavated to verify there were no bones that had been missed. There is a small pit where L6007 was, with its lowest elevation being 99.95   There are two more loci, L6006 and L4013(In trench A4 from which A6 extends) which are rock features resembling the structure and direction of L6001 and thus suspected to be additional cist tombs. Due to lack of time we couldn't excavate either of them.        ,~: A-6-2001-08-04-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6,"460,2001-08-04," A-4-2001-08-04-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4,","A-4-2001   August 4, 2001      A4 Weekly Summary; Trench Closing Statement      The last week's excavations in A4 have focused on two areas. The first of these was putting a deeper sounding into the northernmost 1.25m of the L4000 trench in order to provide vertical control for the excavations in A7.      While largely uneventful, we did manage to push 10cm into a what turned out to be a new stratum near the bottom. Because this stratum had a higher clay content, there was some confusion about the possibility of there being an area of adobe wall melt. No specific loci were identified here in A4, however. The situation was actually resolved with additional excavation within area A7, where this stratum was assigned L7001, and it is so marked on the A4, L4000 profile map.      In retrospect, this break also looks to define a possible occupational surface, as there is a visible line of cultural debris in the south profile in the deeper section of trench. A small, partial clay figurine was also recovered from approximately the same depth. This would have to be followed laterally to determine for certain.      The second area of excavation was an eastward trending 2x4m trench identified as L4008. This was a rather shallow excavation which turned up 3 burials, a small area of ash and broken pottery, a rock alignment, and an area of apparent adobe melt.      Two of the burials are represented by crania (4011, 4012), while the third is an adult or subadult ulna (4010). The latter may or may not be associated with bone fragments identified 2m away in A6. Of additional interest is L4015, an area of less consolidated fill forming an oval area running east from the 4012 crania to the edge of L4013 rock alignment. This area would be consistent with fill associated with a burial, and also the first example of such fill found. In all the burials exhumed to date, the fill around the burial has been largely indistinguishable from the general fill in the area. This is a point worth testing, since it might aid in identifying burials before they are actually exposed.      Of the remaining loci, the ash and pottery stain is of least interest. A soil sample was taken from L4009, but it turned up nothing of interest (Katherine). Too ephemeral. It had nothing else associated with it.      The rock alignment may be of some interest, however. The central rock of this loci is extremely large--at least 75cm long and still embedded in the sidewall. It would certainly have required great effort to move. Like some of the rocks in Area 6 rock alignments, this one is rectilinear rather than smooth and river rolled.

Final Statement. August 4, 2001      The A3 area is dominated by a single test trench 2x8m long running west from A1. Like every trench in the A area with the exception of A2, its purpose was to expose the extent and density of burials at the top of Kenan Tepe. A3 is most remarkable for the number of burials found: 7 all told, 5 in the first four meters. Most of these occur at relatively shallow depths, often within 50cm of ground surface.      The only architectural feature found in A3 is L3004, a small fired clay arc or rim found in the 1.75 meters west of A1. This feature is 1.3 m long, 10cm wide, and 5-8cm thick, and its shape suggests a much larger, circular feature. While identified as \mud brick\ in the locus sheets, it's not certain that the feature is anthropogenic in origin. Andy has suggested the possibility of a partial rodent burrow cemented by urine, for example. A small area of fill west of the feature has been left to help protect a nearby burial, and can be sampled later. Although the shape of the feature suggests something larger, it terminates within the trench on both ends.      The only other loci of interest area set of soil changes occurring in the bottom of A3 in its western 3m. These loci are further below ground (about 75cm below at 5m west) and associated with color and texture changes. The most obvious of these are they area of yellowish clay sediment in the NW corner of the trench (L3014), the mixed adobe melt and ashy colored sediment in the middle (L3015), and what looks like a somewhat more diffuse version of L3015 in along the north sidewall (L3012). What these represent is unknown. L3013 and L3011 are areas of less consolidated sediments around or near two burials (L3009, L5001), but in retrospect there is little to differentiate them from the general L5000 fill. All of these features were identified as we came down on them and all share a roughly similar level of origin.      Although none of these loci could be distinguished in the profiles, L3014 appears to continue into area A5. A5 was not excavated to the same depth as the western portion of A3 because of the presence of several burial and rock architecture. About 10 centimeters of the west profile on the A3/A5 boundary was removed and exposed L3014, however.      In short, A3 is most remarkable for the number of burials (7, 1 exhumed), their distribution (5 in east near A1, 2 elsewhere), and their level of origin (5 around 50cm, 2 around 75cm), as well as the lack of any substantial architecture. The issues surrounding each of these points are largely laid out in last week's day plan. This includes the question of burial density, which is lower in the west half of A3 than the east, but clearly not at an end.     ,~: A-3-2001-08-04-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 3,"462,2001-08-04," D-5-2001-08-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,","   August 4, 2001      The two main jobs of the day were trying to articulate NW ash pit L5047 and, push L5044 back down to the S in the continuing effort the level the entire (non-pit, non-wall) trench. Finally, some work was done to understand southern mudbrick wall L5045, which finally came to some fruition.   Pit L5047, which I originally had thought was either a) just an ash lens or b) a thin ash layer under floor L5034, is much more extensive than I originally thought. The pit continues almost 50 cm deep and its outside dimensions are at least 1 meter long (NW-SE) and half a meter wide, though I'm not yet confident of its dimensions, as I find myself undercutting some areas.   L5044 was pushed back successfully and now there is just a sliver preventing almost the entire trench from being level (which is a good thing, as overall there isn't much going on; between phases? destruction layer?). The big three cultural relics came out (pottery, bone, lithics) but nothing extraordinary. Though the fill isn't one-hundred percent consistent (some slightly ashy areas and some slightly silty/sandy area near where L5038 used to be), there are no discernible features so the fill assessment seems fair. The area below is being designated L5054.   Finally, some more cutting of the southern portion (split from northern by sounding L5052) of L5044 finally revealed that wall L5045 indeed comes to a corner after coming about a meter and a half out of the southern baulk and cuts to the SE. Unfortunately, as the large pit L5024 is in that portion of the trench, finding a continuation of the wall into the E baulk or large portions of the associated surface could prove difficult.     ,~: D-5-2001-08-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,"463,2001-08-04," F-8-2001-08-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8002,","   Aug. 4, 2001      0530 hours 71 Fahrenheit/22 Celsius in the shade      I am really enjoying these cool mornings, I think that the workers are also, although, some of them looked a little cold up on top of the tell.   Work today is began by taking out the left over areas of L8007 that are not under other loci, mostly these are on the South half of the trench , through this action it becomes evident that the surface of pebbles and small cobbles L8010 extends South for another 0.75 meters and East from there about 0.75 meters also. These surfaces have more pebbles and pottery within them than other regular fill area. The problem with L8010 is that it is at a higher elevation than L8011 only two meters away, but similar elevation as L8018 giving some idea that they are likely associated, whether as walls, floors, road, or... is not for certain at this early stage.   Some of the pottery coming out of L8016 is interesting and have deep indentations on it. Some of the ones in L8010 present 3rd Millennium characteristics.    Notable find today in the excavation was a .04 by .05 meter metal ring found laying on the strip of ground running East to West that is part of L8016. It's preservation is intact if heavily corroded, it seems too small to be a bracelet and was possibly part of some tool.

Exploring this locus has made me look at the surrounding areas a little closer. The north area of L 9006 has changed. It is still a little bit ashy, but it is mostly a harder clay now. It scrapes easily and comes off in fine particles. The clay looks lighter when sitting. It is a light gray on the ground, but when scraped the little pile of particles looks like a darker gray. Although L 9006 looks darker when dug, but dries to a lighter color, this soil is still lighter and much firmer and more hard packed in composition than L 9006. This is a new locus L 9008.   I sprayed L 9003. It's nothing. I_Ñém going to take some pictures so the clay lines in the baulk and the clay still standing can be correlated. Then I'm going to level the area. Well, I didn't actually get to level the area, but having pictures is good and at least we'll have something to do tomorrow.   I did take off L 9007 the last of the fake virgin soil. I then closed the locus. Under this reddish brown soil was the dark ash of L 9006. I did not define if this would become part of L 9006 or a new locus. I will do this tomorrow first thing in the morning.   I leveled out the south end of L 9006 that was a little higher yesterday. Then I pushed this soft ash area down another 5 cm. Having the soft stuff come out helped me to define the boundaries of the new locus L 9008.   The area just of the sounding has stayed ashy, but it is not as dark and organic as L 9006 was.

Because, yesterday afternoon Drew, Andy, and Rob took the spider shoots, so we had to do the drawing very carefully.      After I have finished the drawing process I have taken out the rocks that have locus number as 4038 (they are touching the floor that is L4030; it is a sealed floor). Then I began to remove the floor; L4030 and as far as I can see an other surface is coming up. Besides these I have taken the sherds out and then I have articulated the sherds that are stuck in the baulk.       I have to mention that the floor (L4030) is sealed and it is very important, on the other hand L4032 equals the floor because in away it is the continuation of the floor.      My plan for tomorrow is to come to the same level with L4037; that is the pavement that consists several stones and large parts of sherds.

The course of action for taking down L2084 remains the same as yesterday- slowly peeling away one layer at a time and taking photos of each. After several peelings two carbon samples and a layer of large potsherds were encountered. This layer of potsherds is similar to the surface encountered in L2085. Below the potsherd layer a pithos sherd was found. It was left in situ. To the best of my knowledge no slag was found, however, the worker who dug this pit is young and regretfully I didn't keep a close enough eye on him as I should have. Several potsherds were later found in the araba.   In L2082 the purpose is to see how far the pit goes, what cultural material could be recovered, and most importantly, to see the relationship between the pit and the surrounding walls and surfaces. A surface of small stones became apparent in the eastern portion of the pit. The rest of the pit was trowelled and cleaned, but showed no further extension of the surface.

First we wanted to find the surface which is under this fill. Second we wanted to see if we could find a general structure to the wall that seems to be surfacing out of the south baulk running north, L3037. We set out to accomplish this by seeing where we thought the wall would be going and changed the locus to the east of it to L3038 in order to not mix loci in anticipation of the wall. Before we dug L3038 we needed to finish taking off the remainder of L3027. After that we dug down a few cm in L3038 but left the southern meter of it undug because we ran out of time. We did not find out anything from that area so tomorrow we will have to dig down further.    In L3034 we dug the entire area W of the new wall down several cm finding isolated chunks of cobbles.

The two major items of interest within A7 are a stratigraphic break roughly 75-100cm below ground surface (L7001) and an associated burial (L7002). The burial is unique among those identified to date in that it appears to be lying with its head to the south and feet to the north (rather than being oriented E-W with the head to the west). It is also stratigraphically the earliest burial. Although another 25 or so centimeters of fill was removed from the northern two meters of the trench, no additional human remains were found. This portion of A7 is very near to a sharp break in slope at the top of the site, and there isn't much room left for additional burials at this level/elevation.      If the burials in the other areas of the trench are taken to represent two possible periods of occupations (a hypothesis to be further tested), than this burial would clearly represent a third. Regardless it is a second, since the fill in which it occurs is below and distinct from the upper 50cm or so of topsoil in which all other burials occur.      August 21, 2001 (Amy Stevens)   After the Final Report was written I began to excavate burial L7002.

The bricks are rather small and you can see mortar lines in places.   I also had him cut back the area of virgin soil of L 4037 so it was straighter and we can see the section better.

It is interesting that this natural layer is quite a bit different from the natural layers that we hit in the other G soundings. The dirt was a lot siltier for awhile and then towards the bottom of the locus it turned to clay. The absolute bottom of the trench is a rockless, firm clay layer. We didn't find any artifacts in the bottom 20-25 cm of the trench. I took a soil sample, not to float, but instead to compare with the bottom soil of the other G soundings.

My day was not even half a day. We had a couple of things to do this morning that we assumed would take the rest of the day, and then the plan was to get a spider shot of the entire trench first thing in the morning on the day we get back. The items of business that we had ended up taking up less than half of the day, so we ended up closing shop a little earlier than other trenches and I worked on getting my locus descriptions caught up.   Anyway, we first took out the areas in L1036 that are on a directly parallel line with L1037, the black ashy layer. As we expected the ashy layer continued underneath the locus. We are making L1037 go straight up to the wall for the day, although it does appear that the locus may have actually ended 15 to 20 cm before the baulk. As we expected the dirt was relatively hard, followed by the soft dirt which precedes the revealing of the black ashy layer of DOOM. We also took down what remains of L1028 another 10 cm or so to see if the black ashy layer appears on the other side of the trench. On this particular area the black ashy layer does not appear, although it may continue farther to the north instead of in the far south side. There does appear to be a small change in the composition of the soil, as it looks as though there may be some charred surfaces associated with this. The actual dirt is still light brown, and obviously not as black as the black ashy layer.

We had encountered in the Northwest quadrant of the trench this lighter, harder soil while going down and decided to give it own locus number (8017).   Much of the day is spent in cleaning and articulating open loci and discussing as an overview of the trench, the presently uncovered features and their possibilities and relations to each other and where and how our follow up will continue after our time in Van.   In looking at the possibilities of Locus #'s 8011, 8018, and 8010 which have the looks of a surface or wall but more likely a surface or several surfaces due to their repleteness of small stones and pottery fragments may be related to each other and as we uncovered another small area of similar characteristic but slightly below the others, the thought at his time is to continue going down this time in the Northwest corner seeking to uncover in that side of the trench additional surfaces of the same type as those already found, and see where that leads us.

We found that there is no change underneath so we are keeping the same locus.   The second place we dug was the fill above what I think is the beginning of a N-S running wall L3037. This fill I have designated L3039 and it separates L3038 and L3034. We didn't find the wall just yet but some conglomerate is surfacing about 1 m N of the stones of the wall that we have already uncovered coming out of the south baulk. The one thing that bothers me is that if the wall continues north it will be at least 10 cm under the already exposed part.    We also brought down the south west corner of L3034 down to try to define the stone wall that is appearing to the east of it L3037. We didn't find anything.   The last thing we did today was to take of the surface inside the oven feature with the potsmash on it L3036. It was hard packed and contained some ash. Underneath it is an ash layer that has two parts. The first part is a dark brown ash and the other is a light gray. This ash layer was one of the original target surfaces so we are getting close to being finished with this terraced area.

We may be on the bottom of the oven already, because the oven walls do not continue further down, but there was not a change in soil composition or color so we will scrape down a few more centimeters to find the bottom surface.   In L4009, the fill around the oven, we cut a small .20m x .15m section up against the south wall of the oven to see if there were any associated surfaces. We have not found anything yet but have only gone .10m down.   In L4012 we chopped down the new section east of the west baulk .15m.

The feet of the skeleton were technically in Area A1 but were included as part of locus 3002 although they were recorded as locus number 1040 in trench A1. The upper half of the body was twisted to the side and this contorted position was supported by a large piece of hard clay and rock that was directly behind the left scapula and left humerus. The body's head was on the northwest side and unlike burials 1030 and 1035 there was no certain piece of pottery directly under its head.

I think that even our workers are excited to be back! This trench F8 which sits in a cliff/hill overlooking the famed river has now yielded several areas of small cobblestones intermixed with pottery pieces lending a credible possibility that if they are related we may have a surface, wall, or a mix of these. An earlier idea had me thinking that we were seeing an area where a wall made with small stones collapsed towards the East, this idea could have given us a reasoning behind the different levels of stones. Of course whatever surface was associated with the oven (L8002) is long gone, possibly by cause of the plowing. The aforementioned wall could have stood running North to South and fallen at some point towards the East. The current idea though is that these are a series of surfaces -and not just one- but several distinctive surfaces which date from different periods. All this is conjecture at this point but we hope that further excavating will clarify these points.   With all of this in mind and as the Northwest quadrant is currently devoid of these features I will seek for the needed associations or beginning to said floor or wall from this direction.   Work today thus has been to lower adjacent areas of L8016 to see if a beginning can be established to these surfaces, as this work progresses a new small pebble surface was located immediately to the North of L8011 on the North side of the trench.

We also took down the area of L 9006 that was at the same higher elevation. It became part of L 9009 after digging this first level. As the soil was ashy I took a sample for floating. We also found a piece of mudbrick in the area. There were some smaller mudbrick chunks in the soil of L 9009, but for the most part it's just soft ash. I saved a large chunk of mudbrick and made it KT 9078.   After we dug L 9009 about 20cm so it was level, a large potsmash or potsherds started to appear. So I had the workmen take down the area about 5cm with the small handpicks so I could see the area better and see if anything popped up. I closed KT 9079, the old pottery bag for L 9009 which was almost full anyway. I then opened a new KT 9083 for this second level of L 9009 that we're taking down. I took elevations on the area so I could close and open the bags appropriately. I left the bone and lithics bags the same as there were minimal amounts of artifacts.   The potsmash increased in size and a couple of other large fragments appeared. I won't take them out today, but I'll plot them in on the day plan.   I also started scraping and taking down the rest of L 9006. It doesn't extend as far north as I had originally thought and the hard gray clay of L 9008 extends further south. I took out half of what was left of L 9006. It's getting hard so I'm sure that L 9008 will subsume it. Because of the slanting deposition of the layer it took longer to get to the hard layer in the south. Therefore KT 9085 may have some mix because the locus will change as soon as the other half is taken out.     ,~: F-9-2001-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9004,"484,2001-08-10," D-4-2001-08-10 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4004,","   August 10, 2001      Today I have excavated the loci 4030 and 4032.

It's a good thing we kept digging because as we did the workmen speared a water bottle down there. It had been there since last year so I had them dig another 10cm and hopefully we'll be through all the crap that's built up and actually hit new stuff. The trouble is the stuff from the corners of the sounding could be good because we had to cut the baulks back so much. We found a really nice pedestal base today before we dug up the bottle. There are also some nice large fragments coming up in the southwest corner of the sounding.   Since I took pictures of the potsmash in L9009 yesterday I took them out today. The larger cluster its own bag KT 9091. The other two pieces were just isolated fragments so they went into the regular pottery bag which happened to be just those two for the rest of L 9009 since I didn't dig it today.   I finished excavating L 9006. The area is much harder now and not as ashy so I closed L 9006. After it was dug I had a workmen straightening the baulks in the area. When I looked again sitting in the middle of the trench was one of those \digging spades\. I picked it up and the workmen cried, \Chup tash!\ They could see I was irritated as I vehemently said,  o it isn't!\ and asked where it came from. Lokman swears it came from the northwest corner of L 9006 where we did not dig today. It seems a bit large to have fallen out of the baulk. However he vows that's where he found it. I took an elevation on its alleged placement and made it a small find KT 9093.   I also had a guy dig in L 9005. That locus is changing. It's not as loamy and loose as it was before. It's becoming hard packed clay. I'll probably close it today as well.   Some beautiful sherds came up in L 9004 so I screened a few buckets to see if anything good came up. Nothing did. Only a few rocks.   Then I took down L 9008 so it was level with the rest of the trench. I think both L 9006 and L 9005 which I closed today will become part of L 9008.

Nonetheless, the trench was full of excitement before breakfast when we were digging.   The day's focus was wall L5045 in the south of the trench, first by excavating up to the clear bricks on the outside edges (L5060), to the west and north of the mudbrick.   However, because the bottom of SE pit L5024 was mysteriously getting lower and lower everyday and can probably be correlated to the workers dumping dirt in there and shoveling it out, digging a little extra out every day. Thus, I asked them to flatten the bottom out, which turned up a third segment of the wall, a NW-SE portion (L5061) connecting to the SW-NE portion of L5045 near where it enters the baulk. Thus, we have three walls around an area of approximately 1.5m x 1.5m before the L5061 goes into the baulk itself. Further, a surface was discovered (L5063) on the inside of wall, lower than I expected it, which abuts with the walls, and also appears to abut a charcoal filled oven (L5062), which is also within the walls. Notably, the fill above the floor (L5058) was full of thin but large pieces of white/gray ash in which the grain of the wood was still visible (took some macro photos of it) and which possibly contains a few grain remains. At the moment, my obvious guess is that these are associated with the oven. Though I have found some similar deposits in the other parts of the trench, none are near so extensive and dense as those in the fill above floor.   Further digging also seems to indicate that the NW-SE portion of wall L5045 is not actually cut by pit L5024, but rather ends before reaching the baulk, near oven L5062, possibly having been a doorway in antiquity.   While I had one worker in the exciting SE corner, my other workers were busy cutting the SW and NW sections of the trench, in preparation for a future drawing of such.        ,~: D-5-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,"489,2001-08-11," F-1-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1031,","   August 11, 2001      My workmen are sweeping and so I am going to write some in my  to describe some of what we did today.   Began the day by removing what was left of L1032, along with part of L1036, the part which was left next to L1032 and was separated from the rest of the locus by the black ashy layer of L1037. This turned out to be beneficial for several reasons. First, as we removed the rest of L1032 we were able to fully uncover the potsmash which was laying on the surface of the ashy layer. We were able to remove this impressive potsherd as KT 1195 and KT1196, as it was large enough to enter into two bags. I believe that this potsmash may include remnants from more than one pot, as there are two different kinds of rims which do not match each other. Secondly, as we removed these areas we could see that the black layer did indeed continue underneath it, but in the far southwest corner this changed. The black ashy part disappeared, or better put it seemed to reach a wall or barrier which was not the same color or consistency, but was instead a brown surface, possibly the beginning of a wall or something like this. At the present time it is impossible to know for certain. We gave this area where the black ashy surface ended Locus number L1039.    We looked at the crusty clayey surface with the burned parts on it and decided (duh) that it is different from the bricks. We gave this surface, on which nothing is visible, L1040. We then tried to follow this surface towards the south baulk, digging in the area which is still known as L1031, the oven. This began as though we were going to be able to pop the bricks off at the clayey surface, but it quickly became impossible to do and we ended up spending a great deal of time trying to be able to evaluate how the clayey surface was related to the similar burned clay surface which we had encountered in the oven and in the pit next to the oven a little while ago. We are not sure how they are related, or if they are similar entities, although they do look similar, but we have taken many pictures so that people can look over the relationships between L1031, L1036, and L1040.     ,~: F-1-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1031,"490,2001-08-11," F-2-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2011,","   August 11, 2001      We finished scraping and sweeping L2010 and L2011. Both loci were taken down in 2 arbitrary levels (10 cm each). Since the trench was leftover from last year, we've been attempting to get rid of off-season fill and redefine loci. Actually, my workers were a bit overzealous and dug more than 10cm--closer to 20 cm in some places. There was a bit of orange soil mixed in with the L2010 soil. There was no specific location attached to the orange soil. I would be more apt to say that it was randomly located throughout. When we finished excavating L2011 we noticed a larger concentration of orange colored dirt in the SW quarter of locus.       I created new locus 2012. This locus makes up the SE 1/4 of the trench. We found more random orange deposits. This locus is essentially the bottom 9 cm in the east half of L2010. Originally I was going to change the Western half of L2010 to a new locus, but my guys dug too deep. Thus, instead of changing the locus I had them straighten it to the half way point in the trench and I just changed the Eastern half to L2012. The change is not based on any clear soil changes, but simply an arbitrary transition based on the fact that we've dug quite a bit of depth without changing the locus.       We found an articulated animal leg in L2012. I took a photo, as requested by Andy. We finished the day by straightening the bottom of L2010 and L2012. I haven't done a munsel of L2012, but the soil was generally a dark brown with some burnt soil mixed within.       At the end of the day we started scraping/redefining loci at the bottom of L2010. We, so far, see a couple of lines (we don't know what they are yet) running from the West baulk into the middle of the trench (between L2010 and L2012). A mudbrick was also found next to the West baulk. There was quite a bit of burnt charcoal associated with both the line and the mudbrick.      ,~: F-2-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2011,"491,2001-08-11," C-3-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,","   August 11, 2001   First thing today we took out the last part of the undug portion of L3038 which is in the SE corner of the trench. The soil does not change underneath the part we dug so the east area below the oven L3030 remains L3038.   Next we dug off about 10 cm of L3039. L3039 is the fill above what we think will become a wall L3037. Underneath this we found that the comes out about another meter and a half and then stops probably turning east from its north route and going into the east baulk. We will have to wait until we finish digging L3038 until we can see if it truly turns or just stops. This wall feature L3037 slopes downward from the S baulk. Area B4 has a wall that does something similar. Also right next to the wall we found some grayish white material, probably eroded limestone. I am waiting to change loci in order to dig a little more in L3039 to see if the wall slopes any farther down before turning.   Lastly we brought the west part of L3024, the locus that the NE part of the trench contains, down to the same level as L3018. We found that the hard surface of L3018 only continues a little bit underneath L3024, the rest is cut by pits. There are at least three pits that we can see in under L3024. The first is the continuation of L3029 which comes out of the N baulk cuts 3018 and continued under L3024. The other two are SE of the above pit and have not been labeled yet for lack of good definition. The soil in the north part of L3024 is loose, ashy, silty loam which is probably part of the pit that is in that region. The dirt starting 1 meter south of it becomes a coarse, sandy, more compact loam which does not seem to be ashy. Tomorrow I will define these loci and look to see if there are more pits and then continue pealing back L3024. Also one of the pits edges cuts L3018 at a very visible line and in it seems to be a dark ashy soil.      ,~: C-3-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,"492,2001-08-11," F-8-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8002,","   August 11, 2001      0530 hours      Today we are finishing up the removal of the first layer of L8016. The plan is to level this locus then begin a systematic removal of the pebble-small cobblestones-pottery surfaces found throughout the trench, these are: L8010, L8011, L8018, L8019, and L8020 in that order. The reasoning is basically tied to the height but is mostly arbitrary. Visually these surfaces appear to be at different heights, and while this is the case L8018 and L8010 have similar elevations. We also need to take into account the slope of the area, and what it may have been in years past; and a case may be made for a more direct relationship (s) between these surfaces. Also added to this discussion is the pottery which displays similar characteristics between the loci. These surfaces which we have pedestaled up to now might yet tell us more about their origins as they are removed.   While working on L8016 we unearthed a stone tool resembling an ax- head, it is very well preserved and almost complete. It's measurements are .15 x .07 at its widest, and .15 x .04 at its narrowest. The elevations were 65.60 - 65.56 meters. L8016    KT# 8128.   Pottery from the surface of each of the loci being removed was surface collected. This was followed by separate collection of pottery from within the loci.    Once we are leveled we will clean and evaluate the relationships between the loci and move on.       by: Marco A.

I had stop for a while, because we had to take some elevations with Bradley.      I started after breakfast again, and now my workers Prof. Mehmet and Nejat are articulating and taking L4042 approximately 5cm, but because of being at the slope it is a bit difficult to get the same depth. It won't solve the problem directly but at least it will keep me going at the same level. So, the south east corner is being dig as 2 cm at most. This locus is not sealed as L4041, but they are same as and I have found many unbroken potsherds, I think that they need to be examined.      After cleaning L4042, my workers turned back to L4034, they took it down like 34cm, while they were taking the soil down, I was articulating the S baulk of the trench. After articulating the baulk I have helped my workers in L4034, and I didn't recognize that it was time to close up.      My plan for tomorrow is to take L4041, that is the sealed surface, to the same level with L4042. Besides these I think that I will close the second pit of the trench, so this means that the third pit will be closed, too.      On the other hand if I can do it I am planning to take out L4041, because just then I will be able to see if the huge rocks (L4037) are going beneath the floor or not.     ,~: D-4-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4004,"494,2001-08-11," C-2-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2075,","   August 11, 2001   There is much to do today. First, elevations need to be taken from L2080 as they are inconsistent with the bottom elevations of the locus above it. Also photos need to be taken of L2089 and L2088. While the workers remove the stones from the wall L2088, I will describe the surface of L2089.    L2083 was excavated and the pedestaled stones were removed. The pebbly surface was left. We tried to follow the extent of the surface, but ran into some cay tas, one of which had a carbon sample in it. When these were pulled a big gap was left in the locus. At the bottom of this gap the soil became dark. L2087 was taken down more in the hope of determining its relationship with the pit of 2084, particularly whether the pit was cut into it or whether stones were piled up around the pit. Pithos sherds and a basalt grinding stone were recovered.   L2075 was dug to find the relationships among 2087, 2084, and 2081. Pithos sherds were recovered. Most notably another course of stones belonging to 2088 were uncovered     ,~: C-2-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2075,"495,2001-08-11," A-7-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 7/Locus 7004,","   August 11, 2001       Today I began working in A7 after its week of abandonment. I renamed Locus 7002 to Locus 7004 because 7002 was closed on the locus sheet and the measurements only consisted of the top of the skull. Removed about 20 cm running north and south from the block of dirt around the burial. This dirt was recorded as locus 7001. Will begin to expose the skeleton tomorrow. There was a special request from Andrew and Rick to excavate this burial along with a burial in A6 because the heads are on the south side which is inconsistent with all the burials we've done this season whose heads have been on the west side.    Note: I changed the elevation of #5 on the 7/31/2001 day plan because it had been the final elevation and didn't match the elevation I took (and double checked) today.     ,~: A-7-2001-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 7/Locus 7004,"496,2001-08-12," F-7-2001-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7005,","   August 12, 2001   Area F   Trench 7   Katie Smith      Today we started by taking elevations for the closing figures yesterday and the opening figures today. After elevations were taken the workmen pushed down the elevation of L7020 around the surface/pottery area of L7024. They went down 10-15 cms. and found a few interesting things. First, there appears to be a pit just to the West of L7024. We did not have time to analyze it, nor has it been assigned a locus number. The other interesting thing that was found was an articulated brick with some particles of brick around it in the southeast corner of the trench. I am not sure what type of structure it made up, or if there are less obvious mudbricks around this one. We will have to excavate more thoroughly later. We closed L7020 and opened another fill layer, L7035. We finished taking off the fill layer of L7019 in the southwestern corner of the trench and closed it.      We finally addressed the linear reddish soil that appears in the southwestern corner of the trench. First we sprayed it this morning with water and determined its dimensions (3.5 meters in length by .40 meters in width.) We assigned this area as L7033. In addition to this we opened a locus sounding to see if it could enlighten us on the nature of the soil. This sounding is L7034. We went down about 15 cms. So far the work has been done, but no analysis. I have no idea what the soil is.      Work also continued in the northeast corner of the trench. We peeled off fill L7031 from fill L7007 and closed L7031. There is nothing extraordinary to note about this.      I worked with fill L7015 and continued to look for a continuing surface...but to no avail.

I'd already taken out the potsmash and two large fragments which ended up with their own KT and no other pottery from the area in the bags. These pottery bags have pottery from the rest of the locus.   I am not pleased with the way this trench has been going the past couple of days. The soil seems to be all the same, but coming back to two loci seems wrong so I decided to spray down the trench and take a look. The area around L 9009 looked the same. I had some better, but not incredible luck while spraying L 9008. I found a small pit L 9010 in the west baulk that was fairy close to the south baulk. We dug it all out today and I closed the locus. There seemed to be a high concentration of root hairs in the soft soil we pulled out, but no roots. It also wasn't so linear like a root trail. Its small size may indicate an animal burrow, but it didn't tunnel out or have anything leading off of it. It was just a small contained pit.   While looking around in L 9008 I did see an area of reddish dirt. It wasn't well defined. Part of the problem was that that area of the trench was not very flat. There were a lot of small bumps. I had my guys level the are so we could get a better look. Then the sprayer broke. We eventually got the area kind of wet, but I still don't know what the red stuff is. I marked its current boundaries in on the day plan. I'll just have to follow it out to see what it is.   We also had a guy working in the sounding. The round pottery installation was made into L 9011. Since it was a good context under where the baulk was cut it got its own number. I didn't remove it because I want to push down in the sounding and see if it fits in context with anything else. We dug the sounding about 20cm and finally saw bricks starting to come up in the far northeast corner. We pulled up some more garbage (yes, quite literally), but it was in the center of the sounding which was deeper last year because they dug it out due to the softness of the dirt. Now we may be coming on an oven wal or something.     ,~: F-9-2001-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9004,"498,2001-08-12," D-4-2001-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4004,","   August 12, 2001      Bradley is taking some photos right now, and after we will take our elevations, and will check on the previous ones. After all these L4041 will be taken down to the same level with L4042, and probably I will be able to see if L4037 is going beneath the sealed floor L4041, or not.      My second aim is to find out if the there is a continuation of the mud brick wall or not. But, I think that a few rocks of L4037 are going beneath it, that is to the N direction. May be the sealed floor L4041 is touching the mud brick wall; L4035.      We began to remove (to rock'n roll) the sealed floor L4041, at the N side of the locus the soil became a bit soft. I have taken a soil sample for Catharine. The color of the soil from L4041 was 10YR 5/2 grayish brown, but now the soil sample that I have taken is 7.5YR 5/4 brown and it is fine as the pervious one. By the way, I think that a few rocks are counting under the sealed floor, but not more than three pieces. I am very lucky, because a new floor is showing up.

Afterwards we swept and tried to make some sense of the soil differences. Towards the center of L2010, we found some banded soil. The soil is composed of stripes and two sets of brown color (one lighter than the other). The stripes don't seem to have any sort of pattern to their size/shape; except they always run horizontally in one confined area (east/west).       Some more articulated animal bones were found. It looks as if it is part of a sheep/goat leg (Andy).       There seems to be a definite darker layer running from the West Baulk, in the Southern 3rd of L2010's bottom.       Andy came by at about mid-day and we decided that we would remove L2013, such that the bottom of the trench in the SE, W, and NW quarters are relatively even. It took us the rest of the day to push through this locus. The soil had some small rocks but was mostly composed of a brown silt. Most notably, we found a basalt grinding stone (18cm x 10cm x 4cm) in the eastern baulk of this locus. Unfortunately, it seems to have gone missing; or at the very least I never saw it come back from the field.      ,~: F-2-2001-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2012,"500,2001-08-12," A-6-2001-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6001,","   Aug.12, 2001    Today my goal in A6 was to remove a step of dirt lying over L6007. We had believed L6007 to be a human burial lying north-south because we uncovered a bone which resembled a humerus head oriented in this position. I first dug around L6007 to verify its orientation and it turned out that the bone looked more like it was part of an os coxae but not human. We couldn't uncover much because the step of dirt was in the way. It had been suspected that this step was a burial because there were some bones exposed at the east end. However, when we dug around these bones they came out and they were isolated pieces of animal bone. There had also been a human ulna at the west end of the trench but it was lying north-south so it didn't appear to be part of the step of dirt.    We removed the step of dirt with caution for human bones. We found a few isolated human phalanges and a human sternum with no sign of a complete skeleton. There were also some animal bones and pottery sherds.

Upon doing this I could see that the skull was on its side with the face facing south. I dug on the east side of the head to check for bones and found them, showing that the skeleton in fact runs east-west with the head on the west side, just like the others. Because the purpose of unburying this skeleton at this time was the significance of its difference in orientation from the others, we will discontinue unburying this skeleton this season. We reburied the head but it may not be in as good of condition next year because the dirt around it is loose and it lies in a step of dirt so there's not a lot of protection all the way around.     ,~: A-7-2001-08-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 7/Locus 7004,"503,2001-08-13," A-2-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,","   August 13, 2001      Today I noticed that the dayplans have been incorrect in one important place; namely the segment of the trench between the north edge of L2076 and the 5m peg. This is the section that we worked in yesterday for the first time since July 31. The area of soil to the north of L2076 was renamed as L2092, but on the dayplans, the loci 2083 and 2071 had been retained. I went back to the former dayplans and corrected this mistake. The area affected is not drawn to scale; I will remeasure and correct the drawing tomorrow. I would recommend referencing photographs when analyzing this section, just in case the corrections to the day plans are not clear.      We started the day by removing L2085. We used Adana-kebab skewers to loosen the soil underneath the plaster block. We then twisted the block on its base such that it was freed from the underlying soil. We then lifted the soil block enough to slip the metal plate underneath. We took two shovel poles (without the shovel heads) and created a bier for the block, tying it with rope across the plaster baulks so as not to endanger the weave impression. We then walked the block off of the step, out of the trench and up the hill to wait for a ride back to Bismil.      After that excitement had subsided, it was back to the usual trench routine. We cut the sections created by L2085-removal and sprayed to find the black ash line again, which is strongest in the east but also visible in the west. We then dug the east part of L2092 down to the level of the black soil. We named this black soil on the east side L2102 (ash surface). The soil of L2092 on the east side flicked off clean at the joint with the burn layer (L2102). After 2092 was gone here we then saw (in plan) a light brown band of loose soil cutting across the burn soil. We determined that this band of soil is a rodent burrow and named it as L2104. We stopped at this point and excavated the west part of L2092 down to the level of the burn line to the west side of the hole created by L2085-removal. We called the burn layer on the west side of 2085 a new locus L2103, which is equal to 2102. We named the ash surface as two loci because it is interrupted by the hole created by extracting the basket weave 2085. The soil of 2092 on the west side also flicked off smoothly off of the underlying surface 2103 to reveal packed soil with ash lenses and what appears to be an oven fragment (left in situ at elevation 96.233). The soil of L2103 is motley colored and patchy, but has dark ash lenses, indicating that it is continuous with the ash surface to the east (L2102).      We cleaned back the soil of L2092 towards the east baulk and the north edge of L2076 (wall), taking care not to cut too far into the wall 2076 that we have already cut into. We stopped clearing back 2092 when we saw a distinct shift from the ash to the lighter reddish yellow soil of the north edge of L2076. Thus we can say for the time being that the ash surface L2102 abuts wall L2076. We want to dig below the level of 2102 in order to determine the height of the wall 2076.       We excavated the rodent burrow 2104 as a pit, because it cuts L2102 much like a pit would. We stopped at the base level of the adjacent trough created by the excavation of L2085, but the soil at the base of 2104 is still soft as though the rodent burrow runs deeper than our excavations today.      We scraped off the ash layer of 2102 on both sides of the rodent burrow and saved them for seed flotation. This soil was dense ash, but contained no inclusions; only very fine soil. We did not screen because we had to bag all of the soil from this thin locus for flotation. The soil underneath L2102 appears to be reddish orange and much harder than the ash surface itself. Tomorrow we will assign a new locus number to this underlying soil and identify it more carefully.      We also excavated north of the 5m peg today. We sprayed the step where L2100 is located and saw a rough line running NE-SW at the north edge of the step. We are not sure if this marks the ending line of the red bricks we see in section, or if there is something coming up to the south of this line. To get a better sense of this area we measured 1m from the east baulk, between the south edge of the rough line we see in plan and the section cut at the 5m peg. We dug this 1 x 2m section down 10cm and sprayed. This allowed us to see in the east baulk that we had reached the bottom of the series of ash lenses. There is a sharp transition between the dark ash of L2095 to the reddish soil of L2100 and the soil that lies below it (we named the soil underlying L2100 as new locus 2101). We determined on the basis of the doorpost/grindstone and the ash-transition line that L2100 is in fact a hard packed earthen surface. We will excavate this new locus tomorrow to identify the soil beneath this surface. We removed the pedestaled soil underneath the doorpost/grindstone (bagged the stone as small find KT2676) as L2100 surface such that it is level with the base of 2100 to the south. We then removed the remainder of the step to the south of that rough line seen in plan; we excavated this area also as L2100. We will clean the west baulk tomorrow to see what L2100 looks like in section there. The portion of L2100 at the NW corner remains pedestaled for now; we want to cut it to see if there are bricks in the south and east cuts corresponding to the bricks seen in the north cut of this step.     ,~: A-2-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,"504,2001-08-13," D-5-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,","   August 13, 2001      Attention continues to be focused on the southern building. Focus today was on the interior oven (L5062) and the area on the outside of the walls (L5060). Dealing with the latter required a superimposed pit be removed prior (L5055) in the area between W wall L5045 and the western baulk.   The pit came out with relative ease, and underneath it there appears to be some additional mudbrick architecture which is, I dare say, probably related to the building. In addition a second row or possibly mud-plaster layer was found on the western surface of the western wall. The area beneath the pit was dubbed L5065.   L5060, which was taken down to the level of the three fishnet weights along the northern wall (L5045) revealed genuine white plaster bonded to the wall and continuing to the depth of our current excavation, which means we have indeed found the surface or it lies still a little bit deeper. It does, however, confirm the depth of the entirety of the wall, which is wonderful given we were having trouble finding courses.   The big carbon sample (KT 5383) was taken out of oven L5062, which has proven to be more extensive than we originally thought. Digging it (level with the general level we're doing currently) revealed that its northern extent is not flush with the W-E segment of L5045, but rather that the wall comes to the oven, whose wall in turn forms a T. The oven appears to be quite large (possibly as much as a meter and a half in diameter) and circular. Some of it extends into the eastern baulk. Also, apparently inside the area the oven (should?) occupy, there is what appears to be a perfectly circular pit, L5064, but it has yet to be dug. Its relation to the oven should be interesting.   Finally, a little time was spent digging in the trench northwards, partially because the architecture may extend that, and partially because space is limited for too many people to work in the area around the structure. In any event, areas of mid-trench fill locus L5054 were shaved a couple centimeters, followed by five centimeters being taken off the southern portion (as L5066) where the matrix seems mostly consistent and some sherds could be seen extending up from the soil.     ,~: D-5-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,"505,2001-08-13," A-6-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6001,","   Aug 13, 2001    Today we abandoned the idea of continuing to unbury L6007 which appeared to be animal bones. Yesterday Lynne walked by and suggested the possibility that the rocks of L6001 and other loci in A6 were cist burials. Today we began by taking elevations of the rocks in loci 6001, 6002, 6006, and 4013 (A4). We then removed the big rock on the west end of L6001. There were rocks underneath on either side supporting the big rock and creating a pit. The dirt within the rocks was notably softer than the dirt outside of and surrounding the locus.    We dug in the dirt until we found bone. We were very excited to see that it really was a burial within a tomb. We found the face of the skeleton and stopped digging. This was a change because so far this season all the skeletons have had the top of the skull closest to the surface. This is the first time the face has been facing up.   We had to open up the baulk around the burial because the majority of the burial was within it. We first removed the topsoil layer and gave it locus number 6011. We estimated this layer to extend deeper than had originally been mapped. We gave locus number 6012 to the subtopsoil layer. We stopped at the top of the subtopsoil layer and noticed that the area directly above the burial looked different than the surrounding soil. It was a darker color of dirt and seemed to have a marked line between this and the surrounding soil - perhaps a difference in texture. This area will be given locus # 6013.    We're very excited about our first burial with a tomb and hope to get much more accomplished tomorrow.     ,~: A-6-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6001,"506,2001-08-13," C-3-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,","   August 13, 2001      Today I started by describing the pit that we identified yesterday which is coming out of the n baulk in the west side of the trench. This is L3045 which is a trench-like pit whose boarder with L3025, which it cuts, is curvy. The soil of this pit is an ashy silt. We dug the western side of the pit east to the remnants of the oven L3006. We stopped here because L3006 is more contemporary than the pit so we want to dig it first. We dug down about 15 cm without any apparent soil change. I will wait until the rest of the locus is down to this locus before I go any deeper.   Next we dug the NW part of the pit L3042 which is 2.5 m west of the east baulk at the north baulk. We dug the area that we found yesterday was at the same level as L3024. We brought this down to the same level as L3042 and now it is ready to be excavated completely.   Next we dug the part of L3024 east of the pit L3042. There we found a carbon sample near the east baulk, KT3369 and in the north a small part of a greenish mudbrick. I am still trying to see if L3018 continues in this part of the trench.   I identified another pit just SW of the oven feature L3030. This pit, L3046, is North of the wall L3037 and cuts L3039. We dug this about 5 cm deep and had stop for the day. The NE corner of the pit seems to go under or stop at the SW wall of the oven L3030.   Finally we started bringing L3038, which is the area coming from the SE baulk west to the wall L3037 and N to the oven L3030. We brought down the locus at the northern part of the wall in order to see if the wall continues there. We did not dig deep enough to see so we will have to wait for tomorrow. In this locus we found a carbon sample next to the east baulk KT3376.     ,~: C-3-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3005,"507,2001-08-13," F-8-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8023,","   August 13, 2001      0545 hours       From the excavated area of L8024 we are moving in a Southerly direction and lowering the trench by another .10 meters. The pit section shows the change in stratigraphy very well and the aim is then to go t this new level and change locus number again. This change in color will serve as our marker to how low to go. We are also moving West at one meter wide increments to get a good view of the stratigraphy layers from that side.    Near the middle of the trench we located a small pot with its very round bottom intact and with several pieces within it and some laying next to it. This was photographed in situ at the Northeast quadrant of the Southwest quadrant of the trench. A couple of other small finds today include a piece of worked basalt rock -which is only the second piece found in this trench and it might be useful to note that the first one had been used as part of L8009 a circular rock formation and borrowed from somewhere by somebody for that purpose and not necessarily from an immediate discard- Finally we also found a sharp piece of red quartz (?) fashioned into an arrow shaped blade. Later another arrow shaped flake was found, this one is (KT#8167) brown in color and fashioned from a hard stone resembling marble.    We have taken out most of L8024 today but left a small section jutting from the West baulk in the Northwest quadrant of the trench to look at it tomorrow with more time and water as the area is providing possibilities that it might be one.

First I closed L 9009. The soil has moved from the grayish brown to a more true brown. Also there are not the chunks of brick and hard earth present anymore. This area became L 9012 and L 9013 and L yet to be named.   With this new area christened I enacted the new plan. We can see in the sounding that nothing is coming at least for a meter on the south sounding wall. So we decided to take the first (northern most) 50cm of L 9012 and push it down 50cm. This would then give us a section on the rest of the area of L 9013 and more on L 9008. If nothing comes up in the section we'll go another 50cm over and 50cm down and take out L 9013. If there's something in the section there then at least I won't have a big dirt box and I'll deal with it as I need to.   I didn't see anything in the sounding/mini baulk of L 9012. I took several photos of its position and closeups of the sounding wall itself. I decided to proceed with the plan to move on another 50cm. I made the second 50cm L 9013. This way the KT bags are separate as are the loci. I swear I munselled both loci and they really did come out the same 10 YR 4/3 Brown. L 9013 has a few more little root hairs in it than L 9012 did.   About 28 cm down in L 9013 we came on a hard reddish area right next to the east baulk. It could be some bricks. I decided to get a section on them so I cut about half of the step. I was going to make it level but as we started cutting it down about 10cm lower some very vivid black ash popped up. We stopped and flattened the area. Tomorrow we will push back and see if we can figure out what it is.     ,~: F-9-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9004,"509,2001-08-13," F-1-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1031,","   August 13, 2001      Hi, my workers aren't the best in the world today, as I have replacements who do not measure up to my regular workers.   But we continue on. Here is a description of the area underneath L1033 between L1041 and L1040. This appears to be a combination of the two areas, as there appears to be a softer surface of some kind on which the L1033 was placed, We have taken down the entire area to either the crusty surface or the soft dirt. We are going to act as though the crusty surface locus L1040 is the extent of the crusty surface, we are going to dig the area next to it as L1041 down to the ashy layer which almost certainly cuts underneath. I am going to take some photos and then we will remove the dirt. In some areas we came up with hard chunks of burned brick. My worker for today thought he had found an oven, an oven without an oven wall, or oven dirt, or oven anything, solely on the basis of a burned brick which looks like it has dropped into its present position. I don't think that is quite what is happening. Anyway, these bricks look as though they are pavement bricks, or similar mudbricks, but that they have been burned.    We thought that there was a small chance that the clay surface continued, but after troweling around the area it became apparent that it did not continue. There were some splotches of burned area similar to the clay baked surface, but nothing as hard or as definable.    Then we went down to the black ash. The dirt on the way down was soft and a darker brown than other dirt that we have been dealing with, and it was good to go down to the black ashy layer.     ,~: F-1-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1031,"510,2001-08-13," F-7-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7005,","   August 13, 2001   Area F   Trench 7   Katie Smith      Today the morning was spent preparing the trench for top plan spider shots. We focused on all of the exposed surfaces. Photos were taken of surfaces L7029, L7005, L7010, and L7030. Spider shots were requested in order to have a top plan of the surfaces that represented the first level of occupation in F7.      After the photos were taken we concentrated on the reddish soil locus 7033. We decided to take down the southwestern elevation to catch more of the soil. So we closed L7034, the locus probe and took everything down to its level. We did not have a chance to clean everything, but it does appear as though the soil turns towards the East. Maybe it is some type of architecture. Determining this is a priority before we close the trench. At the end of the day we found a small bronze(?) that is obviously a small find and assigned it KT# 7032.      I worked on the fill L7015 between surfaces L7010 and L7030. It now appears as though there may be a tenuous continuity at the west end of the surfaces. Since we have taken the top plan, tomorrow we are going to do locus photos and take off surfaces L7030, L7010, and L7029 for sure and maybe L7024.     ,~: F-7-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7005,"511,2001-08-13," C-4-2001-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4/Locus 4024,","   August 13, 2001      We started the day by sweeping as usual. Then we started to articulate L4052 and we saw that it wasn't only one row. It has 2 rows and at some parts there is 3 where the rocks are small.   Also we started to take off the higher part in L4057. There are more rocks coming out of there. (One is a big sand stone).   I will wait for the reddish spot that I was talking about yesterday until I take L4059 off. Because now that locus is kind of pedestaled so it is possible for the red stuff to go under.   Also we cleaned and sprayed L4038 to see the mudbricks at the East side more and I took photos of it while it was still wet.   Now we are taking L4059 off. The soil is coming out as chunks, then we decided to take a spider photo so we stopped taking this out. (The pieces are coming out with flat surfaces where we have a color difference). I want this part to be in the spider photo.   Now we are articulating L4039 for tomorrow's photo.   Interesting: L4030 and L4062 seem to be parallel and also L4041 and L4058 are parallel to.

Bagfuls of ceramics were recovered. About 4-5cm down the ceramics stopped. Carbon samples and a grinding stone were also recovered.   Meanwhile L2075 was trowelled to find the extension of the surface beginning in L2083. Stones in the surface measure about 2-4cm in length. Some pottery was recovered, but some was left in situ, most notably a base. A big chunk of conglomerate was removed exposing some stones which could belong to L2048.

Before I left, I articulated the animal bones that we found in L2015. I took a photo, then I removed them. Also, I did a munsel of L2013. The soil was about 10YR 4/3 Brown.

D4 is a 10'x5' trench. D4 is at the west side of D1 and D2, a week later D1 and D2 were consolidated into D5. The trench was 10cm deep when I started to dig (July 9, 2001), and I have closed down August 13, 2001 Monday.      It took me six days to get rid of the topsoil (L4000, 4001, 4005, 4006) and subtop soil (L4003, 4004); by the way, L4002 was the rocks that showed up in the north west corner of the trench. This means that, till L4007 (the mud brick collapse) I have mostly used the big picks and very frequently I have used the small picks, and with L4007 I began to excavate with trowels. Because this locus L4007 was the collapsed mud bricks, which were big and seemed to be burned, I decided to dig more carefully.      Area D is at the slope of the Tell, that's why it was very easy and quick to excavate the first four loci, because till L4003 I have removed top soil and sub top soil, and then till L4006 I have removed slopewash layers. I was almost 80cm deep at the west side of the trench before hitting the first occupational layers.      After getting rid of all the slopewash layers I have swept and cleaned the whole trench and opened new loci, because I came down onto occupational layers. My first floor locus is 4009, that I have opened on July 17. It is important because it is sealed by 4001 and 4003 (topsoil), and actually I found the first small find of the trench from this locus 4009 that has the kt# as 4060. It is a small broken ceramic bull figurine. To the east of L4009 lies L4013, this locus is at the south side of the trench, it equals the floor L4009, but because of being at the slope of the Tell L4013 is much closer to the top soil, it is covered by much more erosion dirt and slopewash layer than L4009. On the other hand, the soil below L4007 and L4014 (the collapsed mud brick layers) turned out to be a pit (L4024 and L4028). It was the first pit of the trench, and it was covered by the collapsed mud brick pieces. After we removed the collapse layer L4007 and L4014, the pit's locus number became 4024, because I found a chunk of plaster and an ash layer. Than the pit became L4028 (it is still 4028), because I found a second ash layer and new pottery pieces. The base of L4028 is also the base of the pit.      This pit (loci 4024 and 4028) is cutting all the surfaces in the trench, like L4025, L4030, L4032, L4041. The loci surfaces 4030 and 4041 are sealed by surfaces 4023, 4026, 4017 and 4018. These two floors L4030 and 4041 are in a way hard packed earthen surfaces, they have got many various types of ceramic pieces.      As far as Bradley said, the pottery pieces from these two sealed floors (4030 and 4041) are type B2 and B4. Besides these two types I have picked up many Hellenistic pottery pieces.      I was digging to find out the mystery and to learn more about the first civilizations of the world, and actually by examining the sounding D3, I was able to see the floor that has been made of rocks, that have the size of 20x14cm. This floor in the sounding D3 reminded me that it might belong to a small yard or to a walk way. I tried to imagine how people in the ancient times lived, I want to know how things were in those days...      The most interesting small find from D4 was the broken hair pin. It is made of metal and it is thin. I found it on July 22, on L4022, its kt# is 4106. L4022 was to west of the pit (L4024 and L4028) and west of the sounding D3. When I began to excavate L4022, I was using small picks, but after finding the hair pin (it was at the top of the locus; the elevation is 88.44), we continued with small picks and trowels. The soil of L4022 was removed 20cm and I decided to take it off by each 5cm.      Besides these, I found 19 basalt grindstones, a few of them were near to the pit (they were on the south side of the pit mixed in with the collapse mud bricks; L4007 and L4014), the rest of the grindstones came up from the sealed floors 4030 and 4041.      After dealing with many pottery from surfaces 4030 and 4041 on July 31, I have found a road while excavating on the west side of the trench just beneath the fill layer L4034. This road is L4040, and it is made of river stones turned on their narrow edges and are laying parallel to each other. The stones are running in the direction of east-west. On the same day I have found the mud brick wall; L4035, abutting L4040 to the south. It seems that the wall was built first and the stones of the road were placed later, because the edge stones stand up straight against the wall. The (visible) length of the road is 1,40m (the road continues into the west baulk), and the width is 0,65m. The stones around the edges are slightly larger than the ones in the middle.      After a few days I have found a pavement, consisting of several stones and large potsherds. This pavement is L4037, and it is clearly abutting the mud brick wall L4035 on the north side. The stones on this pavement various in size, but they are giant (ave. 20x30cm). After seeing this pavement I wanted to be sure if these stones may go beneath the sealed floor L4041, or not. To be sure of this I have firstly used the small pick (for 4cm) and then I have used the trowel. Now I am sure that the stones are going in the south direction of the trench, because the stones run underneath L4041.      At this point I think that the pit (L2024 + L4028), and the mud brick wall (L4035), the road (L4040), and then the second wall that is made of rocks (L4039) which has three rows are related to each other. This part of the trench might be the outside of a house (the pottery pieces that have been found from these part are from Early Iron Age. To have a stratigraphical guide Bradley and I cut 12cm from the west side of the pit (L4028), but we could not see anything. So, we did not use the probe further.      On the other hand, when we take a look at the baulks I can say that the north west side where L4022 is located, and the west baulk are very good visual guides for D4, and also the south baulk of the sounding D3 and the west baulk of D3 are very good visual guides for D4. These baulks help me in understanding the relationships between the loci.      Finally, just before closing down the trench I have opened a new locus for the new pit that is placed on the north side of the trench, that is halfway in the baulk, and it is 6cm deep. Its locus number is 4044. So, in D4, the pavement (L4037), the mud brick wall (L4035), the fill (L4039), the slopewash part (L4036), the river stone road (L4040), the fill (L4034), the stone wall (L4043), and the basin created by excavating the pit (L2024 + L4028) remain in situ as I did not finish excavating these loci.      On the other hand I have to mention L4008, that was hard packed soil with no sherds, and it was located in the south west corner of the trench. Later on I changed locus number here to L4018, because the soil became softer, then I changed again to L4023 because the soil became loose, and then I changed yet again to L4029 because its texture changed again with the soil becoming hard. Then I changed locus in this corner again to the loci 4031 and finally 4036, which are underlying layers of hard packed soil. So, I changed the locus in this corner each time the character of the soil changed. Besides these, L4010 is the under surface of L4009, and L4011 were the rocks in between L4009 and L4013, these rocks were located at the north part of the portion. L4016 is the fill surface just above L4022, and L4016 was abuting L4019, these tow loci were fill, too. L4033 was the second pit of the trench, it seemed to burned and a few pieces of slag came out. So, the next season I will start from the unexcavated loci that I have mentioned above.     ,~: D-4-2001-08-014-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4,"516,2001-08-14," F-9-2001-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9004,","   August 14, 2001      As I was checking out the section on L 9013 it became clear that the gray/brown soil left in that part of the trench (south of the sounding) stopped after about 15 cm and became more red/brown. I decided to take down the last 1.52m by 15cm as L 9014. My hope is that I can systematically get down to the level of the red dirt we found yesterday (that looks bricky) and then follow it in the hopes of finding a wall.   I also had a guy in the sounding digging in the soft central area which is coming up with ash but also some red clay. Andy doesn't remember there being any clay in it last year. This contamination makes sense as we are still finding some garbage. No artifacts except half of a rusty choppa head left in there from last year. Will the garbage never end?   We sprayed down the trench after we had removed, I think, all of L 9014. I haven't closed the locus yet. I still need to test the soil. The problem when we sprayed the trench was that this north east area that we need to look at gets strange light in the afternoon from the blue and green tents. We're going to come out and look later this afternoon/evening.   The northeast corner of the sounding itself where bricks came up also has some nice stuff in the baulk that is right on top of the area. It looks like there may have been a wall and then some bricks slumped over. This makes sense since we may have picked up some bricks in other areas of the sounding. Some more reddish/orangeish areas have popped up. We're troweling the area looking for lines and to see if we can get part of a curving oven. Some of the bricks are protruding in the middle of the west sounding wall about 80cm from the north baulk. I'm just hoping to connect them with the ones in the northeast. The whole oven theory could work. The north baulk, in addition to the slump, has the concave layers of ash that look a lot like the ash deposition in the oven ( L 4023 and L 4027) of F-4.    There also seems to be one brick in the soft earth in the sounding 5cm from the west baulk and the center north to south (80 cm roughly) close to where the bricks from the hoped for oven wall are. It, however, is running north to south while the others run east to west.     ,~: F-9-2001-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9004,"517,2001-08-14," A-6-2001-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6001,","   Aug. 14, 2001    Beg. day: We began by digging out L6013. There was a hollow pocket under a big rock at what we estimate to be the foot of the grave. We found a foot phalange under this rock. There seem to be no large rocks covering where the legs are but there are flat pottery sherds lying flat - possibly a fill covering.    End day: Well, our perfect burial turned out to be not quite as perfect as we'd hoped. We dug through the dark-colored dirt into the pit and there was a large rock on its side where the legs should have been. We pulled the rock out and saw no bones. This seemed too deep a hole to have no bones in it. Then when we cleaned up at the rock that presumably marks the foot of the grave we found 2 femurs, flipped upside down. The os coxae also seemed to be lying under the femurs. There appear to be tibiae under these bones but we weren't able to uncover a lot.    Hamdala and I articulated some ribs and he began articulating the skull and vertebrae. All these bones seemed to be in great condition with few broken or fractured areas. So the upper half is in good condition and the leg bones are in a pile more or less. Very strange. It appears there will be no burial goods.    Of course we want to know how old the skeleton is and how the burial was dug, etc, but I'm just wondering why the femurs have been flipped over. As I mentioned, the bones themselves are in great condition. They look unharmed.      ,~: A-6-2001-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6001,"518,2001-08-14," F-8-2001-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8023,","   August 14, 2001      0545 hours75 Fahrenheit/24 Celsius      Today we begin by cleaning and spraying the North side of the trench to help with diagnostics and identification if possible and if present of any structure features. My reasoning at this point is that stems from an idea which I began formulating yesterday about the abundance in areas of the white pebbles and their appearance and disappearance throughout the trench. This observation drives the idea (guess!?) that an arrangement of these pebbles appears to move from a Northwestern towards a Southeastern direction across the trench and reappear on the opposite bulk. This line is not very well defined and is not straight but there is enough of a pattern to raise some questions as wells as possibilities. Thus we started digging with this idea in mind. There seem to be at least two possible bands of this coloration and our efforts will be concentrated these areas. Archaeology being about fact and evidence I must admit that looking for 5000 year old walls is a rather difficult project.   After cutting down .05 meters in the area of white pebbles where a wall might lurk but not seeing anything we go for another .05 meters cutting in he same area and .10 meters from the area of the pit and leveling from that side.   As time run out I am still unsure of any structure here, thus I have not changed Locus numbers until I can be sure of a marked difference from what I have to, what I might have.

We had some workersclear away a small part of the hill E of F4 in orderto see the wall in the E baulk more clearly. Most ofwhat was removed was completely mixed up erosion untilwe got to the base of the long (it went east about2-3m) but shallow cut (it came out from the hillabout 1m), which was about 50cm at its deepest (theheight of the step created). I can figure out howdeep it was from the north section drawing of F4. Anyway, after removing that loose material, wetroweled the area flat and the section flat to see thebricks in the wall to see how far east they went. onthat flat area, near the east baulk of F4, at thecorner of the uphill section and the flat stepcreated, i found the 'light weight' piece of slag,which was yellow and gray as I recall, with largepores. The pottery and metal (although I do notremember a piece of metal) came from the loose erodedmaterial removed to create the step and section. Another piece of slag, this one green, came from thenorth balk of F4 during cleaning. I don't recall whatthat was assigned to but it was saved and recorded andI believe its coordinates in the baulk were recorded(it was about halfway down from topsoil). You shouldprobably check with Dawnell about that. I would checkbut I can't run the DB so I am a bit out of luck onthat.In sum, the context for the pottery and the metal (?)is apparently not so great, coming from eroded stuff,really loose and chopped up at the surface, but thelight-weight slag was found in situ, so to speak, andi remember it pretty well; that is, i could find thespot again although it may be further eroded thisseason. Does that help? I originally wanted to make the stepcut another trench, but that would have created astrain on the system during the last few weeks of thedig, when all we wanted was a longer section, so Igave that mixed material an F4 section cleaning locus.     ,~: F-4-2001-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4027,"520,2001-08-14," F-2-2001-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2014,","   August 14, 2001      Today we worked on the excavation of L2014. This locus makes up the NE quarter of the trench. It was elevated about 30 cm. above he surrounding locus (2022). Thus, I was able to see a profile. It looked as if there was a darker layer about 5cm. above the bottom. I, therefore, planned to excavate half of the locus using the small picks; and then pushing down towards the soil change. However, we found what appears to be a wall cutting through (diagonally from the North Baulk to the East Baulk) this locus. We scraped off the surrounding dirt and found three new loci about 10cm. above the bottom (or the top of 2022)       L2018 contains a lot of rocks grouped together in the NE corner of the trench. L2019 is the wall. It is about 50 cm wide at all points, and it is about 230 cm. long. L2020 makes up the rest of the N corner. It borders the SW of the wall.

L2094, the eastern half of wall 2046 (1 course) was removed. Meanwhile the northwestern portion of 2075 was examined. A stone which had lined pit 2084 was removed and revealed that a surface extended across the southern edge of the trench to wall 2088. At this point we realized that we had two surfaces at different levels. The higher surface is bounded to the north and east by 2088 and to the northwest by stones in 2075. The surface goes above the southern part of 2048. The surface is cut by pit 2084. At the bottom of 2084 is another, lower surface of which the extent hasn't yet been fully realized.

Under L4030 there is a kind of soft soil starting.   After this I need to remove L4047 in order to avoid mixing something unnecessary with the sealed loci.   I opened a locus for the West part of L4057 because of the walls occurred (L4062, L4064). These walls should be separating something. Also I noticed that L4063 needs to be expanded because L4064 is showing that direction. So I feel that L4064 and L4062 are the walls separating this corner of the trench from the rest. So L4063 and L4066 is one side of the walls and the rest is different.   So the other half f L4057 is L4067 now. Because this is the other side of the walls.

Also I started to dig L4065 to the level of L4067.   After breakfast we are still continuing digging the loci that we were digging before breakfast.   For this season I am aiming to take the walls and the fill underneath it to the level of the rest and finish the loci at the middle of the trench.   It seems that the wall L4030 continues more.   Bu we are almost lower than L4062 so we are now taking that off. Then we will try to take the second course off the wall. But under L4062 there seems to be some rocks!   Also I think we saw a pit next to the wall on the West side. I will look at that again and put some nails there. I don't think we can dig that part.   In L4061 there seems to be 2 courses of pottery. We couldn't dig any deeper than the level of the wall so I will dig that part deeper. And then I will take the second course of the wall.

Ercan spent the morning scraping the western half of the trench. We wanted to get a very clear idea as to the nature of the reddish-soil structure, L7033. In order to get the full context, we had to push back L7014. In doing so, the outlined of the structure became very clear. We have the original linear wall that runs, more or less, parallel to the western baulk. We also have two perpendicular lines at either end that come together to reassemble some sort of room.      In the eastern half of the trench we worked on clearing out the subfloor fills. We removed L7036, L7037, and L7038. I did not close the loci yet, but I will do it first thing in the morning. In removing subfloor fill L7036, we found the continuation of L7005. We will follow it tomorrow.      We also took out surface L7029. There was a possible connection between L7029 and L7005, but it only consisted of a few scattered pebbles. It has been documented in the photo database, as well as videotaped. There were no soil samples taken from this surface as it was not a sealed context.      Tomorrow we will finish taking out the surfaces and taking down some elevation. We should be able to close all loci and close for the season.      *KT tags were made for L7007 and L7032.

Yesterday Ashim was digging in that area but he didn't take out very much dirt and he was at the side of it so this should be a pretty much accurate reading.    We finished exposing the skeleton. We found no bones in the mid-section of the burial. Also, the humerus was the only bone present on the left arm. I do, however, see the proximal end of an ulna down with the jumble of bones at the foot of the grave. We dug for a sacrum at the end of the vertebral column but didn't find one.    Some people have suggested this being a secondary burial but if that's the case I don't understand why the top half is articulated.

This elevated L2019 above L018 and L2020, giving us a better picture of the wall. I was hoping to define individual mudbricks, but is hasn't revealed any. Instead, it seems to be a uniform or continuous mud alignment.       We also excavated L2021. We divided it in half (east/west sides) and scraped out the very dark dirt with a trowel.

No further courses were found. No signs of further surfaces were found in the northern part of the trench.   Meanwhile the bottom of pit 2084 was trowelled and cleaned to better expose the bottom surface.   In pit 2082 some pedestaled stones were finally removed and after cleaning a surface (2097) was exposed. 2097 looks to be at the same level as the bottom surface of 2084.

This is a new trench this season starting in topsoil. We dug here in order to get a better view of what is going on in this area which has many confusing surfaces and features. We also dug here because last year in C2 there were a couple of slag samples found along with what seemed to be slag pits. My main goal in this trench for this season was to try and find metal production contexts to help strengthen the hypothesis that there was local metal production at this site in this area. I hoped to find some of the same materials, slag pits, ovens for ore reduction, and work surfaces, which were found last year in C2.    I removed the levels of topsoil, L3000, L3001 and L3002, which were mostly erosion and plowed earth. I hit cultural material in the western half of the trench after only about 10 cm of topsoil removal. In the eastern half of the trench I hit culture after about 20 cm. Because of the slope of the hill, the western half of the trench naturally lies almost 1 m below the eastern half, we ended up making a large step, close to 50 cm, separating the two halves, East and West, of the trench. We did this with the big picks and ended up going through some incredibly light, uncoordinated surfaces that are partially washed away here but we caught in the eastern half. The section that this created was a N-S running baulk which I named the mid-trench baulk. The southern portion still remains.    In the west side of the trench we came down onto two things at the same time that made us stop. First was the N-S running, 1 row stone wall that came up in about the center of the western side. The other was the round, clay oven coming out of the NW baulk abutting C2. We stopped using big picks and started digging more carefully articulating L3010 which was a work surface with many animal bones, several of them connecting together, which was actually a series of work surfaces deposited on top of one another and hard to follow with a trowel. This/these surface(s) abutted the wall, L3005, at its south end, which happens to contain a 20 cm in diameter piece of conglomerate, most likely slag which we have sampled and will test for metal content to determine whether it is slag or not. This could mean that these work surfaces at one point were involved in ore reduction and the conglomerate on the end of this wall is slag left form the refinement of metal. However, it is so close to topsoil that it is hard to tell. Next to this locus there was another locus, L3011, which is similar to L3010 in the fact that it seems to be a series of maybe 1 cm thick, light work surfaces which are impossible to follow because of their un coordination and their proximity to topsoil.    Under these surfaces we found two more, L3020 and L3021, which abut the wall 3005 but we did not dig enough to find there relationship to the wall. L3020 is like the surface L3011 before it, light hard to define layers of brief occupation. While trying to follow this surface the workers kept missing the small surfaces and made some small steps. L3021 is a fill layer to the west of the wall 3005. This may have a couple of uncoordinated surfaces like L3020 and L3011 but it is so close to topsoil, 10 cm, that is impossible to discern them from the fill. When articulating the wall 3005 in order to find out if these uncoordinated surfaces were associated with the wall we found KT3304 which is a stone carved animal figurine. We found that L3021 is not the surface that goes with the wall because it is above the top of the wall. North of these surfaces and the wall we thought we had found two mudbrick walls L3016, and L3017. When we tried to trowel to them in order to articulate we found that they weren_Ñét walls they were actually just fill above two surfaces L3018 and L3025.    L3018 is a hard, compact surface that seems to want to run the entire width of the trench, east to west, except in the east part of the trench it is cut by at least 2 very large pits, L3042 and L3043 and finally stopped by the stone wall 3037. It has several of the same attributes as all the other surfaces so far mentioned, it seems to be several hard to define surfaces closely deposited one on top of the other and also when trying to follow it is easily lost. The difference between it and the other surface is that it is so compact and hard the workers had to stop toweling it and start carefully small picking it. I was not able to make a clear connection with this surface and any other features other than the pits that cut it. This is because it is hard to follow and also we didn_Ñét completely excavate around it this season. It will remain to be investigated in the next season. While examining and in some places cutting this surface we found a surface underneath it. L3025 is a strange cobble surface. It slopes downhill and has a large mound like build up/accumulation in the south area of it. This seems to correspond to some light broken cobbles found in the south of L3018 and even lighter, less preserved cobbles in the south west of 3024 which is east of and above 3018. These could either be an accumulation of eroded surfaces from the upper part of the area or it could be some form of path or step way that has been worn and eroded coming from the east and heading west. I think the later may be truer because of the presence of the cobbles in a clear channel and because they seem to follow a rough linear pattern from east to west spanning several elevation changes. In the north this locus is cut by a trench like pit L3045 which makes it impossible to see it in the section of C2 which is where the surface runs to.    The other two things in this NW part of the trench are L3006 and L3023. L3023 is a pit that cuts out of the N baulk and into L3025 and L018, which seems to be characteristic of this surface, which is cut by 4 pits. Locus 3006 is an oven, which starts maybe 5 cm underneath the topsoil. It seems to be founded in the trench L3045 which would make it newer than the pit and therefore newer than L3018. We were not able to completely excavate this oven so we are not 100% sure.   Underneath the topsoil in the eastern half of the trench, east of the mid trench baulk we found an oven 3003 very soon after removing the topsoil. It was a very well preserved oven. The walls were intact and the only missing part was the top of it which we fond most of in the fill inside the oven and surrounding it. This is suggestive of when the oven went out of use. Because of its well preserved state the oven could have been abandoned before it was heavily used. This could be because of a change in the use of the area or of a site. Because it was so well preserved and we found it relatively close to its top I stayed in situ for a long time in order for us to find the surface it was founded on and originally used with. After excavating around it we got close to the surface on which the oven was placed. It was then we learned something about the construction of ovens from the workers in the trench who use the same type of oven in their culture still. They told us that the oven was put on a surface, which was dug into a little. Then they take mud and place it to make a floor for the oven, which is lower than the level of the bottom course of the oven. Then they take mud from the surrounding area and pile it around the oven building a layer of mud coming from the associated floor up to the side of the oven and building up a kind of conical/pyramidal outside layer for the oven. This gave us a guideline for finding the surface for this oven. First we look to se where this outside layer ends and then find the softer ash layer that would be created by use of the oven and the surface that turns into this ashy lens that surrounds the oven is the surface that the oven was founded on. In this case it happened to be L3027 which is a broken cobble surface. We then look to see what surface the floor is founded on. That will be the surface which is not cut by the oven and which the oven floor turns into. This oven floor was founded on the stone wall L3037 beneath it. This is very interesting because several meters north of this oven is another, this time square oven, which has 3027 as a use surface and is founded on the same wall 3037.    This oven is L3030 and is a square oven. It consists of 3 courses, a hard baked clay cap above a packed silty soil resting on a hard mudbrick material. This has several different fill layers in it: L3032 an ashy fill, L3036 an ashy fill with a little plaster and a potsmash, L3040 a mixture of ash and what seems to be weathered soil or fired soil or weathered mudbrick collapse, L3041 which is similar to L3041 but contained KT3390 which was a conical pottery piece, L3050 a lightly ashy clay full of small fragments of pottery. The floor for this oven is L3051 which is clearly founded on L3037 because it contains several of the stones from that wall.   Outside of the oven we have 3 key loci, L3048, 3038 and 3027. L3027 I mentioned before as being a use surface for this oven. We deducted this from a scorch mark which is present both on the oven wall and on the surface. L3048 was the fill that was outside of the oven right after we found and identified the oven. This is an important locus because in it we found KT3239, which is a metal pin like object about 8cm long. L3038 is south of the oven and east of the wall 3037. It is beneath L3027 and contained 10+ carbon samples.    The wall that I keep mentioning is the largest feature in my trench. Labeled L3037 it starts coming out of the south baulk continues north under the oven 3030 and all the way to the north baulk making this a 10 m long wall. It is about a meter plus thick and is broken in 3 places (though it may be revealed further after more soil is removed). The first place is where pit L3046 cut unto it just southwest of the oven L3030. The second place is around oven L3030 where stones were probably removed in the founding of the oven. The third is in the N and I_Ñém not sure why it is cut there. In that area, the NE quadrant of the trench we decided to use the big picks to go down from the level that we were at and stop at the level of the western half of the trench. We did this because we weren_Ñét finding any surfaces in that area and we were having a hard time following surfaces in the SE quadrant. So we decided to cut this, making a section, which we could use as a guide for the rest of the upper area. Because of this we may have missed a pit cutting the wall or we ourselves may have removed some of the stones. We will have to wait until next year to answer that question. Also because of the existence of L3024 surfaces found in the south that continue north are cut by this locus as well as the oven L3030 and its fill layers.    These loci in the SE quadrant are sealed by the loci above them. The two most mentionable of these are L3015 and L3013. L3015 is a stone feature, which we only catch a corner of coming out of the east baulk a little south of center. It is cut in its NE corner by the pit L3026 whose subdivision is L3035. This feature has two very interesting things about it. First it has a conglomerate chunk which seems to have been applied wet or molten. When examining it looks to be slag. This is interesting because it is beneath an oven, L3007 and a pit 3008 which abuts the oven and could be a slag pit. If this were slag it would be good evidence that the oven above it was used for ore reduction. The second interesting thing is that this feature was within L3013. The surface L3013 contained all of L3015 but stopped where L3015 ends. L3013 was a cobble surface similar to the other cobble surfaces found in this area except that it is not as well kept together and it falls apart easily. Above these were fill layers and topsoil.   This entire trench seems to be an outside work and occupation area. The surfaces in this area are discontinuous and hard to follow. Many of them seem to be eroded heavily. There is not much architecture here enclosing any areas. The large stone wall L3037 could be a retaining wall or the outside of a structure wall. Also the presence of so many pits, L3014, 3008, 3023, 3026, 3035, 3045, 3042, 3043, 3029, 3046 and any that we missed also makes me think that this area was not indoors. Furthermore there are 4 ovens in this area and several ash lenses that we see in section. The fact that we also have a large oven, L3030, which was clearly used for large amounts of burning as we found more that 10 carbon samples surrounding it makes me believe that this area would not have been enclosed inside a building. The oven is similar to those seen locally, which are all used outside. Some of this area could have been used for ore reduction as we found a significant, seven plus samples, amount of slag throughout the area.    At the end of the season C 3 has the following loci still open: 3049, 3047, 3038, 3054, 3037 and parts of the fill above it in the north and the south 3039 and 3052, 3034, 3024, 3055, 3018, 3042, 3020, 3021, 3005, 3025, 3006 and 3045, whose eastern side starting at the oven 3006 remains unexcavated as well as a bit 75 cm east from the west baulk and 85 cm south of the north baulk in this loci_Ñés SW corner. The cobbles hat flow west from 3024 through 3018 and into 3025 are still present but caution should be taken in trying to find this next season as seasonal rains may degrade it. After closing the trench I drew the East baulk. The baulk is accurate in depicting the nature of the trench as it shows broken surfaces hard to follow lines and many animal burrows. The center and northern half of the baulk do not represent the levels in the trench very well. First in the northern half we had dug through several un identified layers while digging L3024. Second we cannot see in the section the oven L3030 but we can see several layers of the fill. In the south we can see the 2 cobble surfaces that we found L3013 and L3027 as well as the fill layers. All in all, the south 3.5 to 4 meters of this baulk represent the layers found in the trench while the remaining north section depicts the complexity of the layers in this trench. ë_  "",~dc-terms:title"": ""C-3-2001-08-016-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3"","533,2001-08-16," F-9-2001-08-16-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9,","F-9-2001   F-9 Trench Summary   Dawnell Somerville Moon      I excavated trench F-9 which was a continuation of an earlier trench, F-3. However this year what was formerly a 5m x 5m trench was laid in as the corner of a 10 x 10. Focus shifted because this trench was bordered on the north by the 10 x 10 F7 and on the east by the 10 x 10 F8. And so although it was part of a 10 x 10 it was my duty to keep digging the 5 x 5 and push down while the larger trenches pushed out. Had I encountered some great architecture or a nice floor I could have pushed out and enlarged the boundaries.   Because it was an old trench the baulks eroded during the off season necessitating a cut back and making the dimensions of the trench 4.25 m by 4.30 m.   This trench was not very productive last year so they decided to dig a 1 m by 1 m sounding in the north east corner of the trench. This too had to be cut back severely and thus became a 1.65 m by 1.65 m sounding. The cutting back of this section began before I started excavating the trench, but when I opened it the sounding still needed to be pushed deeper to remove more of the eroded in dirt accumulated over the off season. I made a cleaning locus L 9004 for the sounding so we could save any pottery or artifacts that came out of there.   Excavation in the trench began when it was already around one meter deep. I dug about 1 meter in the west section of the trench and almost 2 meters in the east.   I began by removing a layer of erosion/topsoil L 9000. This was finished after about 20 cm and I divided the trench into two loci. The east, L 9001 and the west L 9002. The trench tended to stay divided along these lines which were from the south west corner of the sounding to the south baulk.   L 9002 was redeposited virgin clay. This area came up with a couple of small finds. When we were cleaning the north west corner of the trench a metal awl KT 9011 was found. This area also produced a grindstone fragment. Once this locus was removed it was above the huge ash layer that the sounding indicated would appear. This ash locus was L 9006. This area of the trench was made up of sloping layers of deposition. Therefore L 9006 was found in the center and then pushed back toward the south baulk while the fake virgin soil of L 9002 stayed there for a longer time. In the north L 9002 changed into L 9005. This was a loamier browner soil. Although the baulk indicates that the ash from the sounding had a small spur heading up into this area it was very hard to detect and I probably missed it and left the loci the same there.   L 9006 had thick ash and in the center of the locus there were flat lying sherds. There obviously wasn't a surface, but there were a lot of them and they were documented with photos. One of the infamous \digging spades\ (KT 9093) was found in this locus although the provenance was somewhat suspicious due to a worker leaving it in the middle of the trench and then telling me where he found it. Regardless it is interesting that one was found here as they were found in F4 and F7 as well.    Once this layer was removed an area of harder light brown clay appeared, L 9008. This spread under L 9005 and covered the entire western half of the trench. This seemed a little suspicious to me so I spent time scraping and found some areas that looked a little more red about halfway up the western baulk and I also discovered a small pit L 9010 that cut the area. This pit was removed and minimal amounts of pottery recovered from it. At this point focus shifted to the east of the trench in an effort to get that half down to the level of the sounding. Therefore the red areas are still present and should be explored further next year.   In the east half of the trench L 9000 was removed and L 9001 appeared. This was a fake virgin soil layer as well. It was above an area of hard clay which at first I thought was a wall L 9003. This clay was bounded on either side by the fake virgin soil. I let the north half remain L 9001, but as it was separated by an entity I renamed the southern section of virgin soil L 9007. I removed the L 9001 in the north and below it was the ash layer of L 9006. The same occurred when I removed L 9007. The ash was present and it became L 9006. I removed L 9003 when it was clear it was an area of slump/clay and below it was ash as well. I made this L 9009 because there were a few pieces of mudbrick present which I did not find in L 9006 anywhere else. In reality they are probably equal.   Once L 9009 was removed we hit on a harder, loamier, browner soil which became L 9014. The north sections of L 9009 were sacrificed to an attempt to reach closer to the sounding. The section indicated that there was nothing new coming for around a meter. I decided to take a 50 cm wide area by 1.65 m and push it down 50 cm. This bashing locus became L 9012. Later as this cut produced nothing I took down a 50 cm by 50 cm square to the elevation of the sounding. This was an attempt to follow a surface ( see below) but it was unsuccessful.    Once all of L 9012 was removed the section still indicated that there was nothing there and I began to remove another 50 cm block L 9013. This did not reach down as far. In the east section I encountered some reddish dirt much like the areas in L 9008. I sectioned up close to this, but it was never fully explained. It is still present and can be looked at next year. On the lower step of this locus some more yellow earth began appearing and some ash came out. Due to time and emphasis placed on what came up in the sounding this was never fully explored as well and needs to be looked at.   I pushed down in the sounding and finally reached clean dirt. (Although some areas like L 9015 which were under the cut back areas already had a good context.) Upon removing all this dirt I found some flat lying sherds and a pottery installation L 9011. This was removed and it had a stone foundation, perhaps a pot stand. Below this was an area of brown soil with a white deposition on it like a salt residue. This became L 9022, but it was not dug as the season closed. It still needs to be explored.   Due to the flat lying sherds and the pottery installation and the hard packed nature of the area I believe we had hit on a clay surface, L 9020. I also feel it may have been a surface as there were three bricks, L 9018, present in the north east corner of the sounding which were three courses high in the baulk. I think this was a wall that the surface may have abutted. All of these were cut by an ashy pit L 9019. There was an ashy area with some nice sherds in it under the baulk cut back that I made its own locus L 9015 so we could save the pottery. This is equal to L 9019 although this locus started at a lower elevation because it was cut deeper last year because it was a soft pit and we had to remove more trash dirt. This pit will need to be excavated next year and the bricks which are L 9018 studied further as well. The surface L 9020 didn't look like it extended much further but it was only closed due to the end of the season so it needs to be watched for next year as well.   After examining the sections when the trench was closed and looking at the sounding stuff from last year it is possible that the clay bands ( most prevalent in the sounding levels) of fake virgin soil could be crude walls. The other trenches in the area should be aware of this phenomenon, especially F-7 as a reddish wall began appearing as the season ended.   F-9 particularly was a rather sterile trench. We have yet to discover what created the huge ash deposition although the ovens in F1 and F4 may be candidates. Priority should be given to lowering the west half of the trench to get a more complete context and then studying the areas found in the sounding as that seems to be the first good occupation levels of this trench.   The last locus was L 9022 and the last KT used was 9141.           ,~: F-9-2001-08-16-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9,"534,2001-08-16," A-2-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,","   August 16, 2001      Today was the last official day of excavation. We concentrated on defining the area between the 4m and 5m pegs where we had removed the basket impression earlier and had found the ash surface cut by an animal burrow. The ash surface 2102 stopped abruptly in a line that we think corresponds with the true north face of wall L2076. We finished taking off the ash layer of L2102, below which we found another level of the surface. We named this new hard packed earthen surface level 2106. L2106 had white plaster preserved in two places showing that 2106 was bonded to whatever was to the immediate south (we assume L2076-wall) and immediate east (still unsure what this entity might be). We are assuming for the time being that the surfaces 2102 and 2106 abut and or are bonded to (2106) the wall 2076. We stopped digging here for photos and documentation.       We labeled a grey area of loose soil as new L2108; this locus is located just west of earlier-excavated pit L2082 at the 5m section cut. This ashy area had a horizontal line of white plaster running through it, corresponding to the relative elevation of L2106. The character of the soil in 2108 below this partial plaster line corresponded with the character of the soil above that line, so we excavated the locus 2108 as a pit and assume that the plaster either washed into the pit or was also plastered over and reused as a pit-location at a later date. The hulking block of mudbrick directly south of L2108 makes it seem like the plaster of 2106 had to have been somewhat wavy to extend over this hard block and down into the top layers of the grey-soil pit.      Next we removed the beaten earth surface L2103 which is equal to L2102. We had named these two parts of the same surface as separate loci because we had to chop the area in between during removal of the basket impression. L2103 was an ashy-pocked surface against the west baulk; this locus contained bits of oven fragments. Underneath the thin layer that constituted L2103 was another surface layer L2107. We are calling 2107 \equal to\ 2106 because the density of the soil and the relative color of the beaten earth surface are similar enough in character and close enough in proximity to be one entity. L2107 had lines in plan-view that correspond to body-size mudbricks. These lines were oriented in the same general direction as the stones of L2077 were. Because we have a section cut here due to 2085-removal we can see that the stones of 2077 run underneath surface L2107. We decided to rename these underlying stones as L2109 (to keep the loci strata straight); L2077 equals L2109. The mudbrick-like surface layer of 2107 was the same thickness and density (testing with trowel point) as mudbricks we have seen elsewhere in the trench. We documented L2107 and removed it, taking the soil down to the level of the stones of L2109 beneath L2107. There is a long oven fragments at the south end of new L2109, just where the stones seem to stop. We left L2109 in place and turned our attention elsewhere to allow for locus sheet record keeping.      We renamed the section in the center of the 4m-5m step as L2105, because the soil of the pedestal underneath where we had removed L2085 was harder packed than 2092 had been when we were excavating. Also, when we took out the basket impression, we called all of the soil we were chopping through \L2092\ but if we had not been forced by the removal-process to dig a \probe\ we would not have assigned L2092 to the soil layers underlying the ash surface (2102 + 2103) which we had to chop through but instead would have peeled back the surfaces more carefully and assigned new loci when appropriate. Anyway, L2105 is equivalent to the soil underlying the ash surface (2102 + 2103) plus the packed earthen surface (2106 + 2107). [NB on 8/18/2001 we assigned new locus 2111 to the subsurface fill below 2106]. We leveled off L2105, removing the pedestaled area left over from removal of 2085. We cut the sections of L2105 to the east, south, and west and were able to see mudbricks in the south section, indicating that L2076 abuts the surfaces we are working on between the 4m - 5m pegs.       We stopped work b/w the 4-5m pegs for now and shifted to the next trench step to try to define the brick entity adjacent to the west baulk at the 8m peg-cut. We cut into L2101 at the east baulk and the 8m peg-cut such that this small section is now level with the step occupied by L2064 directly to the north. We did this to get a section view of the pedestaled remainder of L2100 to the east. The soil of 2100, however, was so dry from days of neglect that we could not satisfactorily see what is happening with the pedestaled soil 2100. Therefore we cut about 20cm eastwards into L2100 (bagged as 2100) to try to find less dry soil we could  ead\. Earlier we had cut the south edge of this pedestaled area and were unable to determine anything from that viewpoint. We have still not been able to confirm whether this remaining portion of 2100 is actually a wall or not; we see the brick lines in the north cut-section, but cannot find them in plan-view nor by cutting from the south and east as we did today. Therefore we have left this small bit of 2100 pedestaled and the question of its identity remains unanswered.         ,~: A-2-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2043,"535,2001-08-16," C-2-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2080,","   August 16, 2001   The plan of attack for today is very ambitious. The plan basically is to expose all existing surfaces to understand their stratigraphic relations to the walls and then to take out the great wall, 2048 as the coup de grace. Things started out as expected with the continued excavation of surface 2095, and the taking down of 2091 and 2096. Not all of 2096 was taken down, just a small square sounding. The northern edge of 2088 was examined for further courses or surfaces. In the southeast corner there seems to be traces of a mudbrick wall, possibly the continuation of 2080. To the west of the mudbrick the soil became very ashy. A new pit, 2101, was uncovered and taken out. Carbon and soil samples were taken from the pit. It looks like the ashy soil continues underneath 2088.   Below pit 2083, the surface defined as 2095 stopped at a slightly higher level than the rest of the surface. An interesting discovery was that of a broken line of plaster oriented east-west. The area north of the plaster line below 2083 was dug and yielded more of 2097, which looks to be part of 2095.   Breakfast was skipped in favor of consultation with Bradley, Lynn, and Andy. Our interpretation is that 2099 was used at least partly contemporaneously with 2088 and 2048 as both walls appear to have been founded on 2099. The surface was used and garbage accumulated, eventually to the point where it reached the level of 2095. The younger surface extends to the west baulk and was cut by two pits, 2084 and 2083. By this point wall 2048 had gone out of use as suggested by the extension of surface 2095 over 2048. A set of stones which had overlaid pit 2083 could represent a remnant of architecture associated with the upper surface.    In the northwest quadrant of the trench it is possible that we have two fire pits, 2078 and 2100 in an area bounded on the north by 2048 and on the south by 2080, a mudbrick wall which could have been used as a fire shield.   Because of these interpretations it was determined that 2048 would be left in place. It seemed logical to stop digging at this point now that the stratigraphy is more clear. It also gives a good starting point to whoever continues the excavation of this trench in the future.     ,~: C-2-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2080,"536,2001-08-16," F-9-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9008,","   August 16, 2001      Today is supposed to be the last day digging so I've spent a lot of time measuring to get a really accurate last day trench plan.   I removed the flat lying sherds of L 9020. We started to clean L 9011, the installation that cutes L 9020. A lot of small pottery fragments started to come out and more stone appeared. I screened the dirt, but it only revealed a few smaller pottery pieces. I put these in KT 9139. I decided to uncover the installation completely and photograph it since it could be dead by next year. In order to do this we took a 66 cm wide x 57 cm long rectangle out of L 9020 around the area.   After removing the area around the locus it showed a stone structure that could be some sort of a potstand. It looks like some of the structures found in F8, although those seemed to be of a more delicate nature. There were some large sherds in this matrix that almost looked like part of the base. I gave these a new bag, KT 9141. The rocks and sherds were removed.   Underneath the area I came upon an area of brown dirt with a white substance on it. It almost looks like a layer of salt was put on something. It has that characteristic of salt water receding and leaving a layer of salt on something. It assigned it a new locus number L 9022, but I did not dig it. I also did not reassign new locus numbers to the area of L 9020 that were split by the cut to take down the area around L 9011 and expose it.   I also took out the bricky thing in the middle of pit L 9019.     ,~: F-9-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9008,"537,2001-08-16," F-1-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1039,","   August 16, 2001      Started out the day by restarting our excavation of the previous day which was going on with both the pit in the south baulk, as well as the oven in the middle of the trench. Andy and I noticed that the brick layer in the oven, as well as the ash which was a defining characteristic of the locus, had all disappeared. Thus, everything we excavated today would be part of a new locus. We gave this locus number L1054. This area gave some pottery, a shell, a small piece of obsidian, some bone in the time it took us to dig it today. We ended up going down 15-20 cm, mostly to see if the brick layers would continue or if it would only be one course, in which case the oven would be finished already. We didn't see any other bricks developing, which quite frankly really is a disappointment, as I was really hoping for a huge oven, but I ended up with a very shallow oven. Shucks.   We then troweled down on the area outside of the oven which is L1052 down 5 to 10 cm to see what develops. In the end the area concluded with the virtual disappearance of the black ashy layer of DOOM. We can only think now that the black ashy layer may be a destruction layer.   We dug out the pit L1046. We found some pottery and one big bone, but other than that not much. After 14 to 15 cm today, we ran into a large number of rocks, medium sized 6 to 10 cm. Since I have never actually seen a collection of rocks in my trench, this seemed cool, as it may be a surface, but we will not know this year. W will keep this as the bottom of the pit for now, since we will not be excavating this area anymore this year.     ,~: F-1-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1039,"538,2001-08-16," F-8-2001-08-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8025,","   August 16, 2001      0530 hours64 Fahrenheit      Today we will close down trench F8 for the 2001 season. The removal of the last section of Locus 8025 and final leveling is under way. Several last height measurements will be taken, but I would like to return to the site once again to do these measurements myself rather than as has been customary let the workers do some of these. The reason for this is some inconsistency with measurements throughout the season. As part of shutdown the trench will be sprayed and final observations of past loci and characteristics will be made with and without the shade tarp. All of this will make things easier for whomever excavates this trench in the coming season.       I am making these notes more concise and saving some of my comments for the final report.      With Locus 8025 removed the trench is still quite devoid of observable cultural remains. The fill appears quite the same as that previously excavated. The trench was changed to Locus 8026 as the level below L8025 was exposed yet there are no marked differences between the two. This is done just for purposes of closure and at this point appears entirely arbitrary.          by: Marco A.

We made good timing! We found the ulna and radius missing from the left arm with the pile of bones at the foot of the grave, but didn't find the left hand bones unless they were somehow mistaken for foot bones. Both tibiae, femuri, and fibuli were present. There were also several foot bones present but they weren't articulated. Several bones came out pretty whole, and some were fractured or broken. For the most part these bones were in better condition than the previous bones we've excavated this season. They were more whole.    There were no grave goods in this burial. There was no rock behind the head as there were in 2 of the burials from this season. There were some animal bones present. I am going to sift the dirt left behind in the grave and dig just a little more on Saturday to check for bones we didn't see.

Trench 5 is a 5 x 10, made from the combining of S-N abutting trenches 1 and 2, which were started late last season, but likely due to the steep slope had only begun to come upon cultural material by the end of the season. Trenches 1 and 2 were dug briefly this season before the two were merged. West of trench 5 is trench 4, a 5 x 10 encompassing last season's trench 3 and also opened this season. The southern half of trench 5 and northern half of trench 4 are separated only by a baulk. The trenches are staggered such that the northern half of trench 5 and the southern half of trench 4 extend out from the abutting core:      "544,2001-08-18," F-8-2001-08-18-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8,","F-8-2001   Aug. 18, 2001      KENAN TEPE 2001 Season Excavation Summary and Conclusions for Trench F 8       Excavator: Marco Baldi (and students of the Choltepe Archaeology School)       This has been a good season in Kenan Tepe. It was also a good although simple season in my trench F8. This piece of real estate that we call F8 is located on a rise overlooking the once    mighty Tigris, that famed river of historical and biblical proportions and one in whose banks civilization began. This is a beautiful green spot in the midst of an often dry and dreary land that are the foothills of the upper valleys of Southeastern Anatolia.       F8 a new trench this year was opened on July 22, 2001. The location of the trench in the \lower town\ section of Kenan Tepe allow us an excellent view of the main 60 meter high tell to the Southwest. The trench was initially laid out as a 10 by 10 meter square trench but the restrictions of the terrain forced excavation for at least this season to a limited 5 meters wide by 10 meters long with one half meter of that on each side preserved as the baulk wall. The main problem for the inability to extend the trench lies on the Southeastern corner of the trench which is several meters below on the cliff descending towards the river. The proposed plan for next year will include excavation on the Eastern half of the 10 x 10 trench. The Southeast corner though, might still be out of reach even then.      Area F is comprised of several trenches, F1 to the Southwest, F4 to the Southeast, F9 to the West, F7 to the Northwest, and F2 to the North. There is also a sounding F3 to the East on the cliff which was not excavated this year. It is on this latter trench (or very close to it) that my Southeast corner lies.       Our purpose in opening this trench was to continue researching the continuation of some interesting features found in adjoining trenches of area F. We thus seek to enlarge our understanding of    those past people who made their homes, streets, and/or structures on this section of the tepe. Our direct aim then is to locate and excavate the architectural remains which signify habitation of the area, for how long the area was used, for what purposes, and perhaps the reason of its eventual demise. This location, if topography has remained somewhat constant, would have been an excellent spot to look over planted fields, to guard the herds from marauding preying animals, and to serve as a look-out point for approaching danger from invaders.      Actual excavation has moved fairly quickly due to the absence of major architecture or features. Actual depth of excavation approaches 1.15 meters in the Northwest corner.   A short compilation of daily and weekly activities highlighting the major events and finds follows.      During the first week of work a well preserved rough baked clay oven was found sticking out of the West wall about .31 meters below the surface and close to the middle of the trench. This oven was given Locus # 8002. The oven looks in shape and function much as the ones you see for sale today. It would have been buried through other levels but the top of it was still high enough that it was probably damaged during the plowing of this flat area. The oven contains were sifted and two bags of ash mixed with soil were collected as the preservation of the walls would have sealed contents very well. It should be noted that half of the oven lies within the West baulk.      The results of the second week of excavation include the finding of two very similar rock formations with one additional like formation on the opposite side of the trench but with some dissimilar characteristics. The first two circular formations were located within the South half of the trench. One is located in what would be the Southwest quadrant, the other in the Southeast quadrant. The last of the three circular formations was located in the Northwest quadrant of the trench. These formations were given Locus numbers 8005, 8006, and 8009 respectively. It was first thought that these formations represented improvised cooking pits, but this idea was quickly abandoned as we realized the absence of the remains from cooking: mostly ashes and/or bones. Since the formations were almost \perfectly\ circular and with small stones lining the bottom of the formations (with the exception that L8009 was not lined with stones on its bottom) the thought occurred to me that these formations would have been created with the intention of placing containers in them. I believe that the container would have been large enough that only the lower part would have been within the formation. The process of fabrication of these features would have an individual lining and leveling the bottom with small fairly round stones tightly packed, the pot would have then been deposited and when it was realized that it was not leveled then additional larger and flat stones would have been used to line parts of the \wall\ (sides). This seems the case to me as for the most part these lining stones are flatter and larger on two sides and would have been chosen carefully. As mentioned above, the third circular rock formation L8009 did not have a stone lined surface but this was made of dirt and the rocks used as wall were of different sizes and roundness, one was quite large in comparison (it maybe supported the pot on the Northeast side), most of these stones were not at all flat like the ones in L8005 and L8006. One of the stones was a worked piece of basaltic rock. The proximity of Locus 8009 to the oven could attest to a contemporaneity between the two.   It is important to note that all three of these features could be contemporary with each other as their bottom elevations vary by only .05 meters. Because of the height of the different rocks used in the constructions of these formations, elevations in the day plans and the locus sheets might appear to be quite different.   We also began uncovering a couple of areas filled with pebbles that could turn out to be surfaces, these two areas have locus numbers 8010 and 8011 and are at approximate elevations but are separated by almost 1.5 meters between them. Locus 8010 has a lot of good diagnosable pottery on the surface, one of these sherds was identified in situ as being third millennium type 95 with fingerprint indentations.      As excavation continued the scattered appearance of small white pebbles was noted, these pebbles are of a clay like material and are mostly small and quite white when you break them apart. These white pebbles do not seem to follow a constant pattern, but I believe they appear in association to or at similar intervals as the reddish soil does. The white pebbles can also be followed in the baulk not only in these trench but also F1 and F9 to the Southeast and East of F8. The red soil is also not the predominant soil in the trench and could signify changes and/or appearance of walls and or bricks. While it is true that bricks today like at the tepe near by are mostly made of a lighter colored mud, the reddish soil could be the remains of similar bricks made with both inorganic and organic elements which would have -over time- degenerated and given the reddish tint to the soil. The mud brick builders of today may also use one, or a variety of hardening compounds (like cement) of more recent manufacture. While it is quite possibly that similar compounds were used anciently it is also quite possibly that some of these materials would have leached out (white materials that clumped into pebbles?). What remains from either of these processes could be the cause of the reddish tint on the soil. In any case there are clear differences of soil color and texture.    Subsequently to the finding of the two areas of small pebbles mentioned above, additional areas have been located. These are enumerated as Locus 8018 near the center of the trench; Locus 8019 next to Locus 8010 also an area of pebbles itself; and Locus 8020 Northeast of 8011. Unlike the first two areas these new ones are at different elevations. Their composition is made up of small to medium cobblestones, pebbles, and broken pottery remains. Their differences in elevation was at first suggestive of a wall that upon breaking or falling down would have left part of its contents scattered at different heights due to terrain, surface items, etc. The wall idea of course is not supported by the found contents, as walls were not made from these materials. The idea that these cobble areas were part of a surface, suffers from the differences in elevations, that is, unless we can verify some powerful earth moves in years past. These height differences makes it more plausible to think that they are in effect the remains of several surfaces which survived other adjacent and contemporary areas by a number of unknown elements. In other words and as one of many possible explanations, water runoff in extremely wet years could have washed off the remainder part of the leftover floors or surfaces.    When the cobble surfaces were removed and after the trench was sprayed thoroughly two round areas signifying pits were located, one of these was partially obscured by the oven L8002, Doctor Parker had a thought that these two features could have been associated as an smelting oven facility were impurities would have been knocked off during blooming and then fallen to a lower pit. When the oven was removed though, it was realized that the oven bottom was approximately .05 meters above the beginning surface of the pit. Even so, we were careful in sifting the contents from the pit for salvageable cultural materials. Other than ash and bone no metal was found, telling us in effect that this had been a cooking pit. The smaller Locus 8022 turned out to be quite shallow and devoid of ash or cultural remains. The bigger Locus 8023 pit was dug out and the contents sifted until its termination .22 meters below its surface. It was noted during the emptying of the pit that ashy remains stopped at about .05 to .10 meters below, with little bone and no ash in the remaining .10 to .15 meters. After excavation of the pit was completed it was also noted that soil color change had occurred and two distinct strata were present within the pit. I should have caught that during the excavation but didn't. During the excavation of adjoining fill we went ahead and changed the locus number when we arrived at this stratigraphic change (from 8024 to 8025).    We have played during the last few days of excavation with possible wall that we had hoped was materializing in the Northwest quadrant of the trench. We have had some color changes hard and/or soft soil and what may be better be described as possibilities of patterns that together would have given us a wall, but it was not to be at this point of the excavation and these features eluded us for now. This business of wrestling walls out of soil which has undergone countless changes during millennia is not an easy one to decipher.   If I may advance a theory for excavators of this trench next year, one should look for more changes as those specified above and look for features found in Trench F7 to the Northwest and also for burned materials like the ones found at deeper elevations in trenches F1 and F9.      The West baulk was drawn and it shows a very clear outline of the pit Locus 8002 with a good amount of ash mixed with soil still in it. The baulk also shows color differences nearer the Northeast corner where red soil is visible, as it contrasts with the white-ish soil next to it. There are also visible layers of the white pebble material mentioned above and their start and stops throughout the excavation. All of this really doesn't tell us much about this trench, but it reinforces some of the peculiarities of near-by trenches. There is some architecture which has just recently been located in F7 to the Northeast and I hope it may also extend towards this trench, even though I have already passed that level. There is also architecture just coming up in F2 at about 0.75 meter deeper than F8 but which unfortunately moves in a direction that would put it outside of my 10x10 meter trench.       Exciting things are in store for next year. And by the way... we did use at least a trowel, big picks, and small hand picks at some point. But most of the work was done by worker ants which I bribed with gum.     ,~dc-terms:title: F-8-2001-08-18-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8,"545,2001-08-18," D-5-2001-08-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,","   August 18, 2001 -*Final Day of Digging*-      There were two priorities for the day, bring more of the central portion of the trench to the level of the mudbrick house, and prepare the trench for a plan photo and close-down. I also had the use of one of the staff (Roberto) to help with the articulation of the plaster surface in mudbrick house (L5068) so I could focus on other things.   More of later surface L5066 was cut down, yielding one new locus, an area of burnt mudbricks in which a few seeds were found (and thus a soil sample taken--KT 5464) which I believe may be a portion of an oven, though further excavation of it and its surrounding area will have to wait until next season.   Towards the eastern baulk, our attempts to dig deeper were thwarted by a level of packed sand, which will have to wait until next season, though it may be related to a downslope accumulation of sand following a possible abandonment hinted at in other loci further to the west, and higher (due to slope), like L5038.   Rob was able to articulate a fair portion of the plaster, considering the time and delicacy required. The best preserved portion was left in for the photo, while extremely patchy areas were taken down to the level of the hard surface (L5069) in hopes of finding the very elusive pottery associated with the house (mostly in vain).   Finally, in the northern portion of the trench, more of surface L5066 was found underneath L5054, but left with the higher locus sealing it as there was not time for proper excavation.   Afterwards, the trench was cleaned and tent removed for the plan shot.     ,~: D-5-2001-08-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5016,"546,2001-08-18," A-6-2001-08-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6001,","   Aug. 18, 2001   Today I dug at the bottom of L6010 and sifted the dirt to check for any bones left behind. I found a patella and some bone fragments. Still no grave goods. And still the question of why the lower half of the body was piled in a jumble at the bottom of the tomb and separated from the upper half by a rock rather than all being together. Either they buried it as a skeleton which seems weird, but not weirder than if they had buried it in separate pieces right after it died, or it was disturbed. I'm guessing the tomb was robbed and they put the moved bones at the bottom when they were done. After all, there wasn't a rock placed over the mid-section of the burial. Maybe there was originally and it was moved when/if it was robbed. That brings up 2 questions: 1) Why wasn't the rock overlying the head missing? Wouldn't they have checked for head/neck jewelry or grave goods at the top? 2) Why was there that rock separating the 2 ends of the tomb? If the body was originally buried whole that rock couldn't have been there because it would cut into the body - there wasn't room for both. That rock didn't break any bones because all the missing bones which were found at the bottom were whole. However, we didn't find the left hand.   After finishing with L6010 I re-began exposing the bones in L6007. This appears to be a pile of animal and human bones mixed. There is a sacrum and femur which do not look human to me. The part next to the femur head (greater trochanter?) has a hook shape rather than being completely rounded and the sacrum seemed too narrow with too small of foramen (holes). There was also a human radius bone and a human phalange. I dug around the pile and it seems not to expand any further unless it expands into the baulk.     ,~: A-6-2001-08-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 6/Locus 6001,"547,2001-08-18," F-1-2001-08-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1039,","   August 18, 2001      Almost everyone was finished and shut down today, but there were still several people who came out to the site to finish up. I, on the other hand, was not finished with my trench, so we continued digging.   Actually, since the oven turned out to be so shallow we didn't really have tons of stuff to do today. We took down every locus in the trench to the place where the black ashy layer completely ends, in most cases about 10 cm, but in the case of the eastern half of the trench L1050 it was only a couple of cm. Things may be developing, but it is very early to assign new locus numbers. L1050 may be developing into a huge plaster floor, but this seems like something for next years excavators, hopefully me, to fully understand and define. We ended up finishing with all of the trench, except for the oven and the pit, at basically the same level. There may be a pit or oven developing in the west baulk, about 80 cm from the south baulk, and I guess since it is the start of so much new stuff that it is a good time to end.              ,~: F-1-2001-08-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1039,"548,2001-08-18," F-4-2001-08-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4/Locus 4027,","   August 18, 2001      We are still digging in the sounding L 4048.

A small concentration of rock (L5009) remains in the northwest corner of the L5000 trench and is separate from L5008.

Area C has four trenches in the current situation, two from last year; C1 and C2 which are 5 meter by 5 meter trenches. C3 and C4 opened this year in order to have a wider explosion of the area as 10 meter by 10 meter trenches with a better understanding with the information from the last year_Ñés two trenches. C4 _ÑÉs neighboring C1 but also have a lot of similar features with trench C3.       In this area the early layers were having Early Iron Age pottery and changing to the Late Bronze Age pottery afterwards so what we were aiming was to understand the EIA of Kenan Tepe better with large exposure of the area as well as investigating the transition between Early Iron Age and Late Bronze Age. Also other interesting thing that we saw in this area last year was the slag pits in trench C2 so we were aiming to identify more about that production that I think we accomplished.      At the end of the season I reached 90 cm depth in the SE corner of the trench which was located in the higher elevation when I opened this trench. But we could not go very deep in this trench because of the features that I was always facing and also I was trying to level the trench to this higher elevation part. Because of that we are not deep in the western side of the trench unfortunately because this side of the trench had aids from C1_Ñés baulk.       As we started digging I took out L4000 and 4001 as top soil and sub top soil loci where I found 3 fish net weight and at that point I hit my first strata which had a lot of rock features scattered around in various shapes and various sizes. Here I started to dig my trench in four quarters with artificial baulks between them for a few weeks then I needed to take them out because I had to find out the relations between the features in the different quarters. . L4002 was the first rock feature that I hit which was a rock grouping without any purpose that could be figured out. Then we started to hit a lot more of this rock features in this first strata. Afterwards some of them started to have some meanings as L4004 and 4020 were rock features that were used to cover ovens (L4027 and 4031). L4003 turned out to be a pit cutting a wall in the next strata which almost stayed in my trench from the first day to the end. L4007 was a mudbrick collapse looking locus that contains a lot of slag in it so it is possible to associate this with the rock circle L4006 right at NE of it and with the surface 4009 located at the NW of the locus also with the slag pit in the next strata. L4006 was a rock circle as mentioned before that we thought it might be a burial because of the suspicious shape that it had (circular rock structure closed with huge rocks on top) but could not find any bones underneath. We put a frame around this rock circle in order to dig it as a burial and I gave a locus number to that L4021 that I extended a lot later to the whole quarter because there was no separation with this frame and the fill around it. L4015 was a locus that both seem to be a wall or a surface that I could not figure out so this is the locus that I marked as a feature. L4017 was a locus seems like a wall with pot smashes sitting on it goes directly to 4012 that was one of the undefined loci. L4018 was looking exactly like a door opening with doorposts and threshold right in front of it. But it did not mean anything to me until we found the wall 4041 which might be related with this locus. L4008, 4011, 4013and 4016 were the rock clusters that I excavated without building any connection with something else except L4011 was sitting at the corner of the walls that I found out in the next strata (L4030 &amp; 4041) Because of the division of the trench all the fills between these features were separated too and these were: 4005, 4014, 4019, and L4010 where we found a stone ball possibly use for counting. L4022 was a possible surface that might be related with the wall at the NW quarter of the trench which is L4023 and the feature L4025 which seems to be a rock dump in front of the threshold in L4018 but also going below L4018. Also L4024 started to evolve at this first strata when we took off half of the artificial baulk between NE and SE quarters in order to find out the continuation of L4002 which was the first rock feature of the trench. We also found another feature that does not seem to have an aim under the baulk (L4028). But afterwards the locus L4024 extended to S under L4002 and in the next strata it was on top of the wall 4030 and also could be considered as it was cutting L4030.       The next strata was the one that we started to find the two walls L4030 and 4041. The first wall that we found out was the long one which was almost 6 meters in length and 0.8 meters in width and sloping down a little towards N. Also this wall was cut by L4003 and then I changed the locus number of this pit to 4047 arbitrarily because I was at the end of the first course of the mudbricks in the wall. The second one (L4041) was found a little late but it was perfectly perpendicular to the first wall that we found. Then our aim turned out to be finding the bottom of the wall with the surface related to that. But after we identified this walls we found out the ash pit at the E side of the wall L4030 at the SE corner of he trench which turned into a section that we were using as a section to the wall also. (L4032) There was a part at the east side of the 4030 wall and north side of the ash pit which seems to be mud brick collapse was called L4040 and this was keeping the surface 4061 underneath which was the associated surface of the wall that had EIA diagnostics. Also this surface was partially below L4042 which was the softer part at the N of L4040 but after we started to take this off we found out some mud brick collapse underneath it. Also there was the surface L4026 that might be related with the walls especially after we found out about the L4058 which was the other mud brick wall like feature also perpendicular to the wall L4030. To find the continuation of this locus at the E side I opened a new locus for the fill there called L4029 where we found a nice metal needle (KT 4135) and a lithic blade (KT4134). In this surface of L4026 we found out layers and layers of pottery stuck on top of each other with a few small finds as a stone ball (KT4231). After I removed these layers we hit a smooth plaster surface here under a small amount of fill which was named as 4059. This was coming out with flat bottoms as well as it was flat on top so the pottery that we collected from L4026 might be related with this surface (4059) also. The other possibility about the L4026 is the possible relationship with the feature 4037which was right under L4022. The other possible outside surface which might be associated with the wall 4030 was L4034 that we found at the W side of the wall. This was not a very well preserved surface but had some pottery and some pebbles underneath. Under L4029 I opened another layer for the fill because I was finding some more stuff and within this fill we found the rib case of a big animal out of butchering activity and I named this as L4053.      Also at the SW quarter of the trench in this strata we found an oven called L4035 which might be related with the slag pit looking features L4048 and L4054. In L4048 we could easily saw a flow and these are composed of big pebbles that are stuck together within some dirt because of high temperature and melted metal. The situation of this oven made me think that there is a relationship because the oven was destroyed by high temperature. Other interesting thing about the oven was that we found some organic material in it. Also the melted pot looking loci L4049 and 4050 with oven fragments and some burnt stuff that was certainly affected by high temperature might also be related with this oven because of the location and the proximity. We have to mention the small one row wall 4046 and feature 4055 in relation to the oven. After the removal of the fill L4045 under these features we found another wall abutting to the oven L4062. This wall was composed of two rows that one of them was touching to the oven. We had the surface here at the level of the oven at the SW corner of the trench (L4036) which also covers the slag pit L4054. (this surface might be cut by that pit but I could not figure it out because of the use of the same kind of material) The fill stratigraphy in this part of the trench is L4021 over 4045 and 4057which was covering the whole S part of the trench.      Around the other wall 4041 we had two fills one at the N and one at the S of the wall. S was L4044 which was smooth and soft and 4043 was at the north that we found the surface L4033 where we found a sceptre (KT4168), the surface or feature L4060 and the pile of rocks L4039 abutting to the wall 4041 which might be a related surface.   Also the NW quarter of the trench had the lowest elevation so I could not dig this part deep. But we found a few features there such as the oven L4031 and the rock feature with the mudbrick screen L4038 and the possible wall L4023 and the rock pile L4025 in front of the L4018 which was the door opening. The fill here turned from 4019 to 4051 when we started to take the features off. After we started to dig the northern part of this fill 4051 I saw a color and texture difference at the SE part of the L4051 which was more crumbly and whiter than the rest of the locus and I named it as L4063. Then I found out that this is coinciding with the new wall L4064 that we found out under the fill 4057 so I closed 4057 and open two new loci for the E and the W of the division created by the walls 4062 and 4064 and the W is 4066 where we found some pottery sitting on top clustered in the middle so this needs to be searched for a surface next year. And at the East I combined the levels below 4057 and 4044 and opened the locus 4067.Here we noticed a line on he floor which is forming a circle that I marked as L4069 as a possible pit but next year we need to look at this again after scraping and going deeper little more. The South baulk was cut a few centimeters back and this baulk-cutting locus is named as L4068.       We usually dug this trench with small pick and trowels because there were too many features that we were facing. Although there are exceptions of the large area fills that we used a big pick.      It is not very possible to see too many differences in the sections. Only one which is worthy was the east part of the south baulk but it still does not give stratigraphic information very well and because of the shortage of time we could not draw it..      If we try to put things together;    First of all we see the scattered rock features in the first strata that some of them indicate that there were some slag production in the area. Most of these features have two rows and the first row was always river rocks and the second row was big huge sand stone like, smooth face yellowish rocks. There are a few loci proves the slag production in the deeper levels, too. Especially the level around oven L4035 with the grouping of the oven and the slag pits with flows visible and melted pot smashes, and the mud brick pieces coming with the oven features.       As another strata we have the thick mudbrick walls (4030, 4041, 4058). The size of the walls indicate that this was an important building. There are a few surfaces that we found out can be associated with these walls. They are: L4034, 4061, 4026, 4059, 4039 and 4060. And these surfaces usually have EIA pottery with good diagnostics.       We also had some little stone walls and L4062 is accidentally or no parallel to wall 4030. Also if we consider that this part is lower in elevation, it is possible that 4062 is the foundation of a mudbrick wall that the wall itself eroded away by erosion. Also the surface L4026 and 4059 coincides right into this area formed as a rectangle by these four walls.      Other interesting thing relation of the features with these walls is the one between L4041 and 4018, 4025. The door opening like locus 4018 coincides right at the end of the wall 4041 and it is slightly north which makes it even better if we think that you cannot enter anywhere from the wall. L4025 seems to be a dump of rocks used as a ramp to the door opening loci to the threshold looking rock.      We shall note that the oven with the slag production activity around was within this strata although I used these for proving the slag production.      In the other strata that I was coming at the end of the season we can correlate the wall L4062 ad 4064 with each other which is separating the E and the W halves of the trench from each other. Actually the components of these two areas were different from each other, too. The W part was having a harder and more crumbly looking face that we started to get in locus 4063 and in the part 4066 we are have sitting pottery that might indicate some kind of a surface related with these walls. Also in this layers the type of pottery stats to change from EIA to Late Bronze pottery. That is a reason that I believe that L4062 is more related with L4064 than it is with 4030, 4041 and 4058.      The other interesting thing that I noticed in the whole of my trench was about the walls. All the collapses of the walls in the E side of the walls which is now uphill side and against the gravity. This is applicable to both small and big mud brick or stonewall. As can be seen in walls: L4030, 4015, 4023, 4046, and 4062. This may indicate that there were a topographical difference, terraces or may be an earthquake although it does not seem very possible because thee seems to be in different time periods.       So I think in my trench I have a big public building fragment from the Early Iron Age which does not have good surfaces related because they were close to the top soil and destroyed by roots and stuff. But also we could find fragments of surfaces in both sides of the wall.       Also in the earlier stage there was kind of a settlement there that I think the stone architecture of the trench goes with. But I could not excavate these layers this year s the associated surfaces and the related features could not be dig.      I am leaving this trench in a situation that I am right on top of a new strata. Which has some stone architecture especially at the W side of the trench which is a lower elevation. Also there is a possibility that there is a surface in L4066 in the next few cms because I was finding some sitting pottery in the middle of the trench. But in the E side I could not find the bottom of the huge mudbrick walls and could not take off the surfaces at the north side of the wall 4041. In the W side of the wall there is a possible pit that I marked as L4069 in my notebook. In the NW side we dug the corner a lot deeper because we were trying to find the surface that we saw in the baulk of C1. But then I changed my plan and decided that leveling the whole trench is a better idea. So that part stayed deeper.       We are planning to cover the mudbrick wall and the surrounding because this locus is sealing what is underneath.      The last locus number that I used is: 4069 and the last KT is 4383.      \të_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_Elvan BASTURK   08.19.2001     "",~dc-terms:title"": ""C-4-2001-08-019-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4"","552,2001-08-19," F-1-2001-08-19-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,","F-1-2001   F1 FINAL TRENCH SUMMARY 2001      Trench Introduction      F1 is a trench located in the far south side of area F in the archaeology dig of Kenan Tepe. It is bordered to the north by trench F9, which lies directly north, but about 25 meters away. On the southeast, on the side of the hill, lies F4. F4 and F1 are only about 5 meters away from each other in true distance from the inside of one trench to the other.    F1 is the continuation of a trench that was excavated last year. It is a 5x5m trench. Because it was a continuation of last year's trench the dimensions of the trench expanded because of the necessity to cut baulks straight to begin the season. Trench dimensions thus ended up being 4.56 meters north to south and 4.18 meters east to west, instead of the customary 4x4.    Initial trench measurements at the start of the season gave us opening elevations of 65.53m all the way down to 65.19m. Most of the trench opened at about 65.40, give or take a couple of centimeters. Final top plan measurements indicate that most of the trench closes at about 64.50 meters, with the pit in the southeast of the trench going down to the lowest elevation of 64.16m. As can be seen, we have gone down about one meter in this trench this summer.    This trench was dug this summer for a couple of reasons. First, all indications from last year were that there was at least one and possibly two burials which we were on the verge of uncovering. We wanted to find the context for these burials and remove them. Second, this trench acts as one piece in the puzzle that is area F. The addition of new information from F1 certainly will help everyone understand better the workings of area F. Since this trench is the lowest trench on the top of the hillside, it may also act as a window into the future of trenches such as F8, F2, and F7, trenches which still have some digging to do to get down to the level of F1.      EXCAVATION SUMMARY      We began the year on July 14, 2001 by dividing the trench into three topsoil loci. We did this because we believed that there were probably two burials in the trench just underneath the topsoil. Thus L1018 was a topsoil locus, and L1019 and L1020 were topsoil loci where we expected burials underneath the topsoil. Concerning the burials, we did run into the burial underneath L1019, a burial which we named L1021. The second burial never really appeared. We found some human skull bones near the south baulk, but a locus designed to dig further down and find the burial (L1022) failed to find any more bones. We can only assume that if the burial is complete that it continues into the baulk, although the bone fragments of the skull we found were by no means complete. These bones were KT#1091. No other human bones were found in this locus, although we did find some lithics which were categorized as small finds (KT#1094, KT#1095, and KT#1096.)   The burial L1021, on the other hand, was probably the most exciting part of the trench this year. Not only were we able to find the burial but we were also able to find some very impressive small finds which are related to the burial and which may help identify the time period of the burial. The burial, as we found it, was in very poor condition because it was left uncovered after the previous year. This meant that many of the bones which had been left on the surface were severely damaged, while many of the bones underneath the surface were closer to their original position. I do not think that I could accurately describe the burial, although I would urge the reader to view the numerous photos of the burial. Several important small finds were found in relation to this burial. Near the foot of the burial was found a complete, unbroken, small pot, 3cm in diameter and 2cm high with dirt inside (KT#1087). Also found near the same area was a thin long stone, 12cm long, 6cm across, and 2cm wide which may have been used for digging. This was found very close to the pot. Then, as we excavated and articulated the burial we found a complete pottery jug cradled in the left arm of the burial (KT#1118). These were the major finds of this locus, other than the actual burial. Actual excavation of the burial ran over several days, as we thought the burial had ended when it did not because of the way the topsoil had messed up the preservation of the burial. All KT#s which are human bone and which come from L1021 are part of this burial. In conclusion, this burial was incredible, especially for the well preserved items which we found which are part of the burial.   Also in this same stratagraphic layer were a small pit which contained nothing which cut into L1018 near the northeast corner (L1023). Next to the burial we made a new locus (L1024), which was a locus because of its location, as it was separated from the rest of the trench by the burial.   On the eastern half of the trench we began to see ash lines, which we took to believe we were perhaps on the verge of finding an oven or pit. We named locus L1025 because it looked as though it was becoming different from the rest of the trench, possibly becoming an oven, and it looked as though the ash may have been bordering it. Around this same time we divided the original fill locus L1018 into two pieces L1026 and L1027, which were also merely fill loci. L1027 bounded L1025 on the north side, while L1028, another fill locus, bounded L1025 on the south side. Later on, while spraying down this L1025, we found a small wall of one row and one course, about 11 bricks, which extended down the south side of L1025. We made this locus L1029. This wall at first we believed may have been an oven wall, but this was later shown to be false by our determination that L1025 was not an oven, but the area right to the west of it, L1031, was in fact an oven. This locus L1031 was not bounded by the wall L1029, although it did have an oven wall L1035 which wrapped around 2 and a half sides of the oven. This square oven L1031 did not have a large number of artifacts in it. It is most notable for the way that it cut into L1033, a large pavement we will discuss shortly. L1031 was also closely to L1036 a semicircular pit which was either right next to the pit, or perhaps touching the pit and acting as a sluff off from the oven. Next to both of these features, to the west of them, we combined the remains of the burial L1021 and the loci next to it and made a new fill locus L1032.    All of these loci, from L1026 to L1032 were all basically on the same stratigraphic level. At this time it might be helpful to note that L1030 was a locus assigned to the east baulk, as some good diagnostic sherds were found during cleaning and straightening before the trench opened this year. Also on this same level were L1036, L1035, and L1034.    All of these loci were on the same level as a feature that literally dominated the trench for over a week. This feature was L1033, the large pavement. As we were analyzing the trench we could see what we felt was the beginning of a large mudbrick wall of alternating colors, one a reddish brown and the other a pinkish white. Further troweling, scraping, sweeping, and spraying led us to determine that this pavement was a large 2.80x2.90m structure, almost perfectly square with the exception of the side where the oven L1031 cut into it. We hoped that this was a wall for some time, but final analysis leave us to believe that it is in fact a large pavement, as it is only one course high. We learned this from our excavation of L1034. We decided that we would take a small section of L1034, about one meter long, down about 40-50 cm with the hope of getting a section of the pavement to see if we could understand it better. As we were digging this section with a big pick we began to pull up copious amounts of dark black ash on the pick. We stopped using a big pick and took this area down to the top of the black ash. The section that we had dug showed that the pavement was only one course, and also that the black ash appeared to go underneath the pavement, 25cm under, showing that it was only a pavement and not a wall. When we finally decided to knock out this pavement we first took a spider shot of the entire trench, a helpful tool.   The black ashy surface which was underneath L1034 was named L1037. This black ashy layer eventually came to cover the entire trench as a new stratigraphic layer, with different loci on about the same level. These will be discussed after a brief explication of the work done to reach the black ashy layer underneath the pavement. We determined that the brick pavement appeared to be placed on a surface. As we removed the bricks by popping them off of this surface it became apparent that it was a crusty burned white clay surface with black splotches (L1040). Also similar in composition, but closer to the east baulk and slightly lower in stratigraphy was another crusty surface (L1042). There were also fill layers which were excavated to get to the black ashy layer (L1041, L1044), and the black ashy layer itself underneath the pavement (L1043). After we had removed the fill loci down to the level of the black ashy surface, everything in the trench was covered in ash with the notable exceptions of L1039, an area in the southwest corner which appeared to be a much lighter color than the ash, and L1038, a general fill area which was most notable for the lack of anything exciting.    While sweeping the black ashy layer we noticed that a circular area appeared in the trench because of the softness of the area on the inside of the circle. Further examination revealed an oven (L1045). This oven was mostly underneath the former pavement, and like the rest of the trench acts as a good context because it is sealed. In this oven was a large pedestal, possible pottery stand, made up of mudbrick 64x30x9cm (KT#1246) which we were unable to remove without breaking. This may have been a pottery stand, whatever the case it is very well documented with photos and descriptions. This oven only went down 10cm before it abruptly ended, both the bricks and the ashy layer of dirt. The fill underneath was L1054.   Outside of the oven we were having a difficult time seeing anything because of the dark ash which could not be swept, so we assigned three cleaning loci to the entire trench, with the exception of the oven L1045 and a pit which we had found touching the south baulk which we gave L1046. This locus L1046 is most notable for ending as the lowest part of the trench this year, as we dug down until we hit a surface of cobbles which may be a surface, or merely the pit bottom. Anyway, these cleaning loci were designed to scrape the top layer of ash off of the trench (L1047, L1048, and L1049). After this cleaning we reassigned loci to the trench, the eastern half was harder than the rest of the trench and so it was a separate locus (L1050) while the other half of the trench was split into about half and one side contained L1039 and new locus L1051, while the other half contained L1052 and L1053.   Our final mission of the season was to remove all of the black ash and get down to a new level, a job which resulted in a new fill locus L1055, as well as the possibility for much more next year.   The finds in this trench, at least the small finds, were few and far in between after the burial and before the mudbrick. Probably the best thing about this trench though, in relation to finds, is that because of the large pavement everything is sealed. In addition, anything below the black ashy layer of doom will be sealed by that.      INTERPRETATION AND STATE OF THE TRENCH AS IT IS LEFT      My trench is a very difficult trench to interpret. One thing that seems to be sure is that it does not appear to be a domestic area, but instead may be a work area. One theory being espoused is that the whole F area, at least at the level where I am digging, is a large industrial area, whereas the domestic areas of the tepe are located in other areas. Indeed, soundings in G and H may show occupation at about the same levels that I have been digging this season. This theory is also confirmed by the existence of the oven in F1, the large ash deposits here in this trench as well as the large amounts of ash in F9, a trench at similar levels as my trench. In addition, the large oven in F4 would also generate huge amounts of heat, making living near the oven undesirable. So far we have seen no indication of domestic settlement near this area, although the pottery we see is from late Chalcolithic to early 3rd Millennium, which means that the pottery from area F is later than other areas. So, to summarize, it appears that my trench was never domestic, and at times was a work area, and at other times may have been a large sidewalk.      The trench ends in good shape. The following is some vital information for the continued success in this trench:      Last KT#: 1246   Last Locus: 1055   Baulk Drawn: East      I think that the eastern half of the trench may be a plaster floor. I also believe that in the west baulk, near the south side, there may be a new pit developing. The large pit and the large oven (L1046 and L1045) have both been completely excavated. At the bottom of the pit there may be a cobble surface, which would be something to shoot for next year, to get down to that level and see what is happening.      And in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make--      The End                    "",~dc-terms:title"": ""F-1-2001-08-19-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1"","553,2001-08-19," F-4-2001-08-19-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 4,","F-4-2001   Trench F-4 Final Summary   Excavated by Dawnell Somerville Moon      I excavated trench F-4 this season which was a continuation of a trench dug last season. It is located on the lower mound on the riverside side of the hill, literally dug into the hill The trench was already around 2 1/2 meters deep on the hillside baulk. The oven L 4023/4027, the dominating feature of the trench, had already been exposed last year. It is interesting to note that there was a smaller oven eroding out of the hillside at a higher elevation that the oven. The baulks had to be cut back due to off season erosion making the trench 3.27 m wide by 3.47 m long. The trench was created from sounding which in addition to the baulk cutting contributes to its odd size. The baulks presented a small problem as the upper elevations were impossible to straighten due to their height and increasing crumbliness. We straightened what we could but there were no perfect straight corners or hard lines there. There was another hillside trench dug last year, F-5 whose presence helped give us a guide to stratigraphy and when to expect virgin soil.   I excavated over a meter of soil in the trench. The trench was semi-closed mid-season as I had reached virgin soil in 3/4 of the trench. It was dug somewhat fitfully after that and was finally closed for the season when the sounding we placed in the trench hit virgin soil. Although there were days when the trench was not excavated most days someone was in there drawing or photographing or cleaning up all the dirt that flies in there so we could dig when we needed to. I believe this has a bearing on the final elevations I calculated for the trench. All the elevations on the final plan are a few centimeters lower than the day plan when I last took elevations. For many days in kept using the same elevations on areas I didn't excavate. I believe all the activities taking place in the trench account for these missing centimeters.   The most outstanding feature of the trench would, of course, be the huge oven L 4023 and L 4027. This feature was still visible from last year although courses of mudbrick had eroded off the wall. The actual mudbrick wall of the oven was 4027 and the ash/soil depositions inside the oven were L 4023. The wall itself was made of mudbricks about 13-18 cm wide and 7 cm high. When a section was cut on the wall mortar lines about 1-2 cm thick were revealed.   The matrix inside the wall was very impressive as well. It was a huge ash deposition filled with animal bones. The ash deposits did have bands of clay present occasionally, but the ash was very consistent through the whole locus. This consistency is the reason it was excavated as one locus instead of attempting to subdivide the various ash lenses. The lenses themselves curved up against the oven wall beautifully so it was easy to follow the line accurately. The general practice was to divide the oven in half and take down first one section and then the other half. I screened about 1/2 to 3/4 of the soil that came out of the oven. I also saved floatation samples and large pieces of charcoal suitable for carbon dating. Despite the work of screening all the soil most of the spectacular small finds did not come out of the oven.   The hope I had of finding a surface associated with the oven did not come to fruition. The trench consisted of the oven, a few pits, and fill. This is possible because the oven would be such a huge heat source people may not want to work or live in such proximity to it. Despite the lack of surfaces the trench did produce a large number of small finds which will be discussed in conjunction with the loci in which they were found.   One peculiar small find in the oven was large 10-12 cm worked stone, KT 4153, that for lack of a better name we called a digging spade. This was not so remarkable until a second, KT 4220 and a third, KT 4254, turned up. This same type of item was also found in F-9, F-1 and F-7. Their function is unknown, but their high density in the area may suggest some significance. Other finds included grindstone fragments and loom weights ( KT 4159, 4161, 4162). There was also a bone awl and some pottery fragments with red pigmentation/ochre on them (KT 4133, 4135) suitable for chemical analysis. There was also a flat based mudbrick item KT 4225 that conclusions vary concerning. Debate ranges from a pot stand/ andiron to anthropomorphic figure as it was found near sheep horns which could have been inserted into the hole in the upper portion of the item that was deliberately placed there.    The general assumption for these items and the deposition in the oven was that the oven ceased to be used and its function became that of a trash pit. Analysis of the animal bone fragments concluded that the patterns by which they were cut reflected not meal preparation, but dismantling for trash. Many of the bones were also burned, supporting the idea that they were burned as trash then the ash and bones dumped into the oven. The locus L 4023 and L 4027 ended at virgin soil L 4042.   The wall of the oven was not seriously studied until the end of the season. Due to its fragile nature and the fact that the soil inside kept getting lower and making it harder to get in, we left dirt from the surrounding loci up against the wall to brace and stabilize it. After extensive photographs we knocked out a 60 cm section of the wall down to the virgin soil it was sitting on and got more information about brick size them.   When excavating the soil inside the oven we had to do cleanup from soil fallen in over the off season. I marked several KT bags as contaminated as opposed to changing the locus.   The whole trench had to be cleaned due to erosion dirt filling in from the off season. The baulks were cut back before I arrived, but I still had to remove the erosion in the trench. L 9022 was the cleaning locus whose KT bags have mixed context. After picking through 20-30cm of fill I closed this and opened three new loci. We generally used the hand-picks when we picked in the trench. There were 4 people in a 3 x 3 trench so there was no room to swing a big pick.   We closed this cleaning locus because the northeast began producing a dark gray soil which was present last season, but not finished. This was L 2024. This locus was later redefined as a pit and began what was a series of pits in the north west corner of the trench This pit was ashy as were most of them in the area. The lines of this pit began expanding and it became L 4033 which was less ashy than L 4024. This pit stopped when we reached virgin soil L 4036, although I dug in it another 20 cm to confirm it was actually virgin soil. From L 4036 in the north west virgin soil began to slowly creep across the trench.   There was another pit system in the trench in the south east. This series of pits began around 30cm below the other system and both of these systems were dug fairly close to the oven wall. It is unclear if they had any connection to the oven, but although they were ashy they never produced the large amounts of bone fragments that the oven itself did.   This southern pit series began with L 4034. This had ashy soil in it. This pit was found right away as it was sealed by an area of mudbrick slump/hard clay L 4028. Once this was removed it was a very clear soil change so there was not worry of pit contamination at its beginning.   This pit produced some great pieces for carbon dating , but it also exhibited some interesting yellow streaks in the soil. These were saved for chemical analysis and some floatation samples taken as well. This pit was not excavated correctly however. The pit line narrowed rapidly after its initial opening and I did not catch this fact until I looked at the section more closely. Therefore about 30cm of the north ends of L 4035 and L 4040 were dug through as a pit. This may be a larger problem as these loci in section look like they were part of an earlier pit which was then cut by pit L 4034.   There was one other pit in the trench located in the south west corner. This pit popped up as a surprise in my quest for virgin soil. It was named L 40344. Due to finding this pit we kept digging in the trench that would otherwise have been closed. This pit was not fully excavated and was closed due to the end of the season. The majority of the pit L 4044 was excavated because at the end of the dig we decided to put a 1m x 1m sounding in the south west corner which took up most of this pits boundaries. This sounding was L 4048. We dug roughly 15cm and then we changed bags. The sounding purpose was accomplished after a mere 30cm and we had hit virgin soil. At that point most of the trench was at virgin soil and it was ready to be closed   The constitutes the major loci of the trench. All the others are fill layers. However, many wonderful small finds came out of these fill layers.   After the topsoil/erosion layers were cleaned off, the trench was divided into four quadrants. The oven, the north west of L 4024 which was defined due to its grayer soil and L 4025 and L 4026. The area of L 4024 was actually smaller than originally defined. Its dimensions shrunk when I found L 4029 a clay layer emerging south of the pit and L 4030 a small band of softer soil south of the pit and abutting L 4027, the oven wall. These loci were in turn reduced in size a the big pit L 4033 cut deeper into the area than L 4024 had. After removing all soil and closing these loci the area became L 4037 which was the virgin soil continuing further south into the trench.   The south half of the trench had some interesting soil changes and was the area where most of the spectacular small finds were found. After removing the erosion layers the south half of the trench was divided into two loci for easier control. The west was L 4025 and the east was L 4026. The soil of both these areas was a crumbly clay that was also like L 4029. The best find from the trench was found in L 4026 about 15 cm deep in the locus. A cylinder seal KT 4132 was found. It had geometric designs on it and was broken on one end. The break looked fresh, but no pieces of it were found in all the dirt we screened. A pestle was found only a few centimeters away, but there was no concrete correlation between the two. These items were found right when a new locus was being opened up. We found them in L 4026, but right after this dirt w cleaned up there was an area of hard mudbrick slump below which became L 4028. This area was taken out and sealed a pit. Then L 4026 was closed and the area renamed L 4035 in case a surface was associated with the top of the pit. This was not dug, but later renamed L 4040 when a possible wall appeared.   L 4026 also produced its share of small finds. Found on the opposite side of the trench 3 cm below where the seal was found was a bronze pin, KT 4160. 15 cm below that a small green bead (KT 4180) and two loom weights (KT 4181 and 4182) one with incised lines (KT 4181) were found. These were all found right together.   A reddish area appeared in the center of the trench dividing it into L 4031 and L 4032. These loci were not dug, but were redefined when I created L 4041 which I originally thought was a wall. The area had good lines, first this red one and then a thin white line both of which I was able to follow into the baulk. But although they were present they did not amount to anything and the area was merely fill. L 4041 reached virgin soil and was subsumed into L 4037.   The far south end of the trench was split into thirds L 4038, 4039 and 4040. These were all fill. L 4039 did produce a beautiful potsmash we were able to reconstruct (KT 4246/whole KT 4300). No surface was found to correlate to this.   After the ash pit was found in the corner below L 4038 and part of L 4039 I combined the left over areas which were exhibiting the same soil into one locus L 4045. This area was closed due to the end of the season, but it was becoming a more pink color and beginning to have some of the small pebbles so it may have begun pulling up virgin soil soon. The area in the east under pit L 4034 became L 4043. It seemed this soil may have been part of the larger pit cut by the small ashy system of L 4034. This area was also closed due to the end of the season.   The other two loci were not excavated per se. L 4046 was a cleaning locus for the north baulk so we could enter some slag into the database. L 4047 was a step we cut into the hill east of my trench to try and catch more courses of the 13 course mudbrick wall that is present. (Excavated last year.) There was some pottery and slag so this area got its own \""east baulk\"" locus so it too could be entered.   Because the east baulk was so impressive with this wall present it was drawn as well as the north baulk with the oven deposition. Most of the loci show up in these two baulks. In fact only L 4029, 4030, 4025, 4031, 4032, 4041, 4038, 4039 and 4044 don't show up.   Overall the trench was bands of clayey soil that had been cut and recut by pits. This may be because the oven was a trash area, and so other ash was dumped in pits in the area. If the area is industrials evidence of this does not reside in this trench. This trench was basically one large entity with nothing else, no floors, architecture to connect it to. This trench has been left at a standstill. There is not much point to continuing to excavate when there is a section about 2m by 1m that isn't at virgin soil. The sounding indicates it will all be there in about 30 cm. The best answer would be to look to the excavations in F-1 which are reaching the elevations of F-4 and has produced a large circular oven and huge dark ash layer in these last few days of excavations. Perhaps the key to production or living space will be found in a nearby trench as it was not discovered here.

It is east of Area C and west of Area A, adjacent to trench A5. Trench B1, excavated last year makes up the south western quadrant of the trench. There is a 1 meter baulk between Trench A5 and this trench and there is a .5m baulk and a .30m baulk between the North and East baulk (respectively) of Trench B1. We opened this trench to reach some more of the contexts we found in trench B1 last year, and because area B had predominately Iron Age pottery, we wanted a better understanding of the Iron Age settlement that exists on the top of the mound. One particular surface excavated in B1 last year was interesting to us because it was a good context for Iron Age pottery and it sealed a new assemblage of pottery that we now think is from the second millennium. We want to capture this transition again in the new trench. Trench B1 was left at around 2m deep last year and the rest of B4 was a newly opened trench. Opening elevations were NW 97.79, NE 98.90, SW 97.88, and SE 99.02. We closed with the following elevations: NW 97.55, NE 98.31, SW 97.35, SE 98.50. So we dug down a little less than a meter in most of the trench.   We began by clearing topsoil in L4000. Since there is a large slope on the mound we cleaned a lot of topsoil for over a week in various parts of the trench. On the first day we found a pot smash in the NW quadrant of the trench and changed locus to 4001 as the top soil above the potsmash and called the pot smash itself L4002. The pottery rims indicate that L4002 was mostly Iron Age pottery. The next day, further east we found a cobble wall with two courses running N to S, which eventually became L4014 but the fill around and above the wall was excavated as L4000. We think that the lower course of the wall 4014, which was partially excavated, is related to the cobble surface we found later in L4027. A piece of the lower course of this wall is still in situ, it is about 1m long and it continues into the south baulk (actually the North baulk of trench B1). We found another set of stones which later became L4008, at the NE corner of the trench that were a single row running N to S at a higher level than the first cobble wall 4014 we found in the west half of the trench. We called fill above the L4008 cobbles L4003 and continued to look for more of the cobbles in both L4003 and L4004. Thus begins the search for the cobbled areas in the trench.   In L4000 adjacent to the North baulk in the eastern half of the trench we found more stones that eventually joined with the stones found in L4003. Those first stones found in L4003 turned out to be the eastern border of a large concentration of stone cobbles beginning in the north baulk and crossing southwards. We called this cobble area L4008 and the final size of the area was about 4 x 4m of large cobbles ranging from .05m to .50m flagstones scattered in no particular pattern, yet the cobbles near the north baulk looked more organized than the rest indicating a possible wall beneath them. In this north baulk section of L4008, there was an area devoid of stones. I thought it was a pit but it turned out to be hard packed silt above another course of stones. This area was our window into what lay below the stone collapse.   A few days after discovering the beginnings of the cobble area of L4008 we started to find cobbles in the Southern part of the trench along with some flat lying pottery sherds. When we saw that this could be a new feature we changed locus from topsoil (4000) to L4004. With L4004 we looked for more pottery and cobbles and hoped to find a link between L4008 and this new set of features. We never did connect the two entities. While digging in L4004 we found a small find which was a ceramic animal head (KT 4066). When we finally found the extent of this new cobble and pottery area we changed locus to L4018 which is the feature itself. The cobbles in L4018 have lots of pottery sherds whereas there are very few in L4008. L4018 is also at a lower elevation than L4008 and does not have any associated surfaces with it.    Another feature uncovered in this half of the trench is in L4019. This is a wall curved into the eastern baulk of the trench with one row and one course. The stones are organized at the north end but are less so at the south end. There were two small finds, one stone cut in half with a recessed hole in the middle and a piece of basalt grindstone. The fill above this locus is L4003.    The last interesting feature in East half of the trench is L4013 and L4017, an oven. We first uncovered the destroyed oven in L4009 and immediately assigned locus 4013 as the fill inside the oven once the fill above the oven was cleared. While excavating the oven fill we found large bits of fired clay and plaster with some charcoal bits that were too small to sample. We excavated inside of the oven first to find the bottom. We dug for a while past a few sets of flat lying pot sherds, past the clay and plaster chunks and found a soft ashy soil that seemed to still be part of the oven. Unfortunately none of these levels in the oven were given separate loci. Then it occurred to us that almost .5m is a little too deep to still be part of an oven. We looked at the adjacent eastern baulk of former trench B1 and saw an ashy layer continuing under the level of where the oven should have stopped. The good news is that I have dug a nice sounding in the middle of my trench, the bad news is that I have mixed the oven fill with the fill below it, but since I was not sure which fill was indeed part of the oven, I did not assign a new locus.    The oven wall, L4017 is an interesting feature as well. We troweled back as much of the caked fill away from the wall in L4017 as we could and found large potsherds lying up against the oven wall and underneath it. We could see the oven wall preserved inside the oven but the outside of it had collapsed. Because the soil was still ashy we continued to dig past the level of the bottom of the preserved wall as L4013. We thought that the sherds up against the oven wall and flat beneath it indicated that a surface existed next t o the oven. We opened an arbitrary area around the oven, L4016 to focus excavation on the fill around the oven wall, looking for surfaces. We found nothing conclusive, even after continuing into L4009 looking for more potsherds or a surface.    The fill loci above and around the features described above have had border disputes all season. L4003 is fill above the large cobble surface in L4008 and the fill east of that surface and north of L4004. I dug extensively in this locus looking for surfaces to associate with the features but found nothing. Early in the dig I found an unusual circular feature with cobbles and pottery which I removed as locus 4011 under L4003 and L4004 (depending upon which day it was). The pottery turned out to be thick fired clay bricks and conglomerate rock, this would have indicated a firing area but that there were no burned or scorched areas, nor was it possible to take carbon samples. L4003 and L4004 were constantly mixing at their south and north border. One day I would look for cobbles and stones continuing south in L4003, the other I would find more cobbles and pottery in L4004 and extend the locus north into previous L4003 territory. Another segment of fill is L4010 which is all of the fill east of the small cobble surface L4018 and then later extended below L4003 as the fill east of the L4019 curved wall.    All of the fill (L4003, L4004, L4006, L4007, L4009, L4010, L4020) west of the cobble surfaces (L4008, L4018, L4019) on the eastern half of the trench has had many transformations as well. First we found a large area about 1.5m wide and 3.5 long of mudbrick collapse, or an area of hard packed silt loam that felt like mudbrick but had no visible lines. Locus 4000 is above the mudbrick collapse and L4006 is the mudbrick collapse area. We kept this area open until we finished articulating the cobble area in L4008 and then began excavating in the west fill. We removed L4006 and established L4007 as all of the fill west of the cobble surface in the eastern half of the trench. About this time we found the cobble area in L4004/L4018 and called the fill west of that area L4009. We peeled back L4009 looking for the extent of the cobble surface and found that we were continuing into L4007 and the soil was the same so we changed the entire area to L4009 which it still remains today. When all of the features were given new names I renamed the fill loci east of the features as one L4020. This locus is fill east of L4008, north of L4018 and west of L4019   Now on to the removal of the features described above, here is where it gets complicated.    I assigned a removal locus 4021 to the feature L4008. We found seven small finds in the area while picking up stones. One large round cobble, one rock with a hole through it, one flat rock with a hole in the middle and the rest were basalt grindstones. When we removed stones from the northern part of the locus I made sure that the stones that we saw previously in the thing we thought was a pit remained in situ along with all of the other stones in situ. We removed all of the stones and found that there was a second course of stones at the North baulk area but the rest of the stones were not part of this course. When deciding which stones were first course and which were second, I was not entirely sure, so I kept some from each course if it looked like they might be associated. I found another blank spot of soil in this course but it was more pronounced. Because I felt this locus was too mixed with the above course of stones I decided to further remove the stones in L4021 and what luck! I find a third course of stones. The blank area between the sets of stones was even more pronounced this time and one set of stones curves into the north baulk while the other continues down the slope of the tepe and is 4 rows wide we called this whole entity L4027. We found some flat lying sherds, animal bones and roots in the area but no surface. We dug a sounding in adjacent L4009 to see if the rocks continued and they appeared to dive down another .15m to the south which may indicate that we have a corner of a wall between L4021 and 4009. We also dug at the western border of L4021 where we had cleaned out a huge animal hole before excavating. We came down .10m and found a hard soil area that could have been the surface associated with the stones but we found no cultural debris. We continued further in this sounding about .05m and found a pot sherd and some very ashy soil.   My biggest problem this year was how to name this feature of three courses and two walls separated by fill. The solution we came up with was that we called all three courses of the stones L4027. This locus includes the northern area of stones that looked like a wall in L4008 (not the entire cobble area), the second course removed with removal locus 4021 and the current course which is level three which remains in situ. The whole structure has been given its own feature locus and description in L4027.    We removed the wall in L4019 and found soft ashy soil L4025 underneath, which is similar to the soil inside the oven. We also removed L4018 and did not find anything immediately beneath but we removed three basalt grindstones from the locus.    When we removed the oven wall feature L4017 as removal locus L4022. We bagged the pottery sherds and oven wall fragments separately in L4022. After the removal of the oven wall in L4022 we found flat lying pottery sherds lying beneath the oven wall and assigned L4024 to this new discovery. We called this locus the removal and discovery of the pottery sherd foundation of the oven wall. Just to clarify, we removed the oven wall in three loci, L4017 is the oven wall feature and the articulation of that feature before removal, L4022 is the removal locus for the oven wall and L4024 is the pottery foundation found directly beneath the oven wall after removal of L4022.    After most of the features were removed we started to big pick the soil beneath as L4020. Under L4019 and part of L4010 was an ashy layer of loose brownish grayish soil that was riddled with animal burrows; by the end of the dig day, the trench looked like a golf course. We excavated this area of ashy soil and animal burrows as L4025 which started as a small area then expanded into L4020 where it was mixed a little at the south border between L4020 and L4025. As I said before, L4020 became all of the fill east of L4021/L4027, and the fill north of L4010 and L4018. We big picked down .15m in L4025 to get past the animal holes and found more underneath. Our original conclusion about this area was that it was a pit, but it looks like the soil in this ashy area is almost the same as the soil inside the oven in L4013. It is possible that there is an entire layer of ashy soil just beneath the current elevation, that continues into the baulk of trench B1. In L4020 we chopped down another .15m or so and found some mudbrick clumps but nothing organized looking.   While this excavation was going on in the eastern half of the trench I decided to open a little sounding area to find out if we would be able to excavate the surface that was visible in trench B1 last year. We opened L4012 as a 1 x 2m sounding in the SW baulk. We went down about .15m and found two huge flagstones continuing into the baulk and surrounded by a greenish grayish ashy layer. When we looked at the section of this baulk we found that there might be a pit in this area, which would explain the soil texture and color. We extended L4012 to the entire west half of the trench with the intention of digging the whole area to the level of those flagstones. We didn't make it that far but we did find some interesting spots. At the north baulk we found a basalt grind stone small find. I took a carbon sample while scraping in an area of very hard silt loam of L4012 adjacent to the remnant of wall L4014, close to where I got the sample we found a potsmash area with a few cobbles in it. We picked up this last set of pottery as its own KT because if we had left it in situ it would be destroyed by next year. I did not change locus for this set of pottery because I found no surface or other things associated with it.     We cut back two baulks from trench B1 this year in order to get a better idea of what would be happening in this new trench. We chopped .23m of the north baulk, L4005 and bagged all of the artifacts. We found a nice large and flat basalt grindstone in the section. We also chopped .10m off the east baulk of B1 in Locus 4015 and bagged the artifacts as well. The sections in the adjacent trench have been a guide for us as to where we should focus our excavating efforts.    My understanding of this trench is murky to say the least. The huge rock installations that we found this year are slightly confusing. The large cobbles found in the North east quadrant of the trench, L4008, are probably collapse from a large wall structure, which we can see the foundations of coming up in the second and third courses of stone. The wall must have been pretty tall and the rocks scattered next to the first course must have tumbled off the wall south and scattered over the area. The cobbles along the north baulk seem to continue eastward which would indicate that they link to the stone walls found in Trench A5 directly adjacent to the NE corner of this trench. Note that trench A5 and its extensions A1, A3-A4 are all part of a supposed cemetery at the top of the tepe, where we found a cyst tomb and over twenty burials. The third course of stones for this structure is what seems to relate to most of the features in the trench. We found that the stones of this course continue into L4009 and they dive downward, so the wall is heading south and there is a corner at the junction of L4027 and L4009. The wall in L4014 found in the west half of the trench is related as well when you see that the wall dives south it runs parallel to the last course of the two course wall we found in the first week of digging. The third course of the massive structure also relates to the oven because the base of the oven is only a few centimeters below the elevation of the third course. The curved cobble wall, L4019, found a meter east from L4008 is at about the same elevation as the top of the rock collapse; I'm not sure how they could be linked. Originally, when we found the ashy soil L4025 below the curved wall L4019 we thought we had a rock lined pit, but now that its clear that the ashy soil extends over a large area and that can not possibly be true.   The second cobble feature in the south of the trench is unusual too. I could find no way of linking this feature with L4008 by a surface or even additional cobbles. I believe this area is a cobble surface that has eroded down the tepe judging by the slope it was on and the huge amounts of pottery that we found when excavating it.    It is most interesting to note that all of these features were within .5m of the opening topsoil of the trench. I have been told that all of the pottery found in these features is Iron Age, so the fact that these structures are so close to the surface bodes well for future trenches in the area. There could be a large Iron Age settlement with a lot of stone architecture.   We did not dig enough of the fill in the Western half of the trench to make any judgments on it but there is a surface only a few more centimeters below the present level in the SW corner of the trench that we see in section.   To close out my trench, my last locus number was L4027 and my last is KT # 4330. We did not draw any baulks this year because it was only until recently that we hit anything other than topsoil. The only baulk in trench B1 drawn last year was the North baulk. It is a good idea to draw the East baulk as well because the stratigraphy for the trench is nicely laid out.    Loose ends in my trench are basically the fill beneath all of the features we took out. We did not find the extent of the ashy soil, nor did we prove or disprove that the area was a pit or not. We did not clean or fully excavate the third course of stones in L4027 so those should be further investigated. In the western half of the trench, L4012, we did not get to the surface but we may have a pit in the SW corner where the large flagstones were found because we can see that the soil has turned loose and is a greenish grayish brown. The rest of this locus is unclear. Also watch for a mud brick wall that may be coming up in the NE fill of the trench in L4020, we found some small chunks but nothing conclusive.    If another large trench is opened north of this trench, the stone architecture found this year might be better explained and we may find contexts to help date these stone structures.

When I arrived I could see that someone had messed with the bones sometime between yesterday afternoon and this morning. They'd all been taken out of the ground and set in a new pile just to the side. They didn't seem to be any more broken than yesterday but the pieces of individual bones were no longer lying together. I bagged the pieces of bones and the fragments and screened the dirt. There was half the rim of a clay pot partly in the baulk. There appeared to be no more bones in this locus. It's possible that they extend into the baulk but I didn't see any sticking out. This \burial\ consisted of some incomplete leg bones, some rib fragments, some vertebrae, a scapula and a sacrum. One vertebra was complete but ended up breaking. No other bones were complete.    This was possibly a secondary burial but there are several bones missing.

All this material came from only 20cm of soil. The potsherds are a mix of fine wares and rough wares, and include small bowls and large jars. We also took a soil sample from the base of L1008 that contains the ashy soil at the top of L1009. We took this sample when we found individual charred seeds.

The purpose of the sounding was to help us define where Area F ends. Similar trenches were F6 (4x2) and F11 (2x1) and F12 (2x1). We always tried to dig this trench as quickly as possible; thus we used the big picks until the trench was too deep for them, wherein we switched to the small picks. The starting elevation was 68.95 and the final elevation was 66.43. We mostly tried to dig in arbitrary 20-25cm. levels.       The first couple of loci were fairly sandy, but contained few rocks. L10002 started to get a bit siltier, and it remained that way through the majority of the sounding.

Most notably, we found an obsidian flake in the final cultural locus (L10009).       L10010 is the virgin soil that we've been finding elsewhere in Area F.

The soundings were about 10 meters apart (F12 was north of F11). In haste, we originally named them Roadcut 1 (F11) and Roadcut 2 (F12).       F11000 was a brown silt with quite a few larger rocks (20cm x 10cm). The bottom of the locus ran into L11001, the sterile lime soil. The top elevation was 67.21 and the final elevation was 66.54.       F12000 was similar to F11000, except that we managed to find a small bit of pottery mixed into this locus. F12,001 was the same sterile soil as F11,001. The top elevation was 66.41 and the final elevation was 65.83.       The most interesting thing to come out of the excavation of the Area F soundings was the realization that the bottom, sterile soil is very different from the very rocky, sandy matrix that we were finding in Area G.

We also used the total station to lay in datum points every 4m on the east and west sides of the trench to facilitate elevations and to serve as fixed points to use as guide lines down the slope. We measured down to the bottom of the tepe; see above datum readings list.      Excavation in this trench was continued from where we left off last year (final locus number last year was 2042 and final KT number was 2311). The same two excavators, Ellie Moseman and Baris Uzel worked together again. Last year's pottery has been dated to Hellenistic, so we were interested in finding out what lies below the wall system we found last year. We had two main goals and one secondary goal for the season: define the walls we found at the end of last year between the south baulk and the 5m peg; press down in the second trench step between 5-10m pegs; move topsoil northwards down the slope. The following explanation of the trench this season will be broken into parts according to these three goal-areas.      0-5m Step (48 new loci total)      We began excavations in the southern part of the trench by removing the mini-step at the south baulk as L2051, 2052, and 2053. These three loci are mudbrick collapse tumbled from mudbrick wall L2056. This wall 2056 remains preserved in the west baulk with its plaster facing intact. We caught the plaster facing because it was evident in plan as a squiggly line running along the baulk as we began to excavate 2052 and 2053. We sunk a 50cm x 50cm probe (L2054) into the south edge of last year's L2042 (this year renamed as L2066) where we saw a plaster mortar line running on the north face of the wall; we were trying to find the base/foundations of 2066 and trace 2066 westward across the trench. This probe exposed rich occupational layers just below the surface. We unified the back end of the trench again as L2059 after 2051, 2052, and 2053 had reached the same elevation. We pressed down 2059 looking for the base of the plastered wall and the top layer seen in probe 2054; we hit an ash surface 2065 in the center of our narrow little trench. This hard packed charred surface had a permanent scoop pressed in for supporting the base of a pot. Around the perimeter of this charred surface, we found fragments of a plaster surface L2061. This plaster surface turns out to be the foundation for plaster wall L2056; the surface is bonded to the wall. We peeled back the remaining bits of wall 2066 and realized that 2066 is founded on the plaster surface (but 2066-2061 did not seem to be bonded together). We named the mudbrick wall that abuts (and is bonded to) 2066 on the north side as new locus 2067. We cut into 2067 to trace the plaster of 2061 northwards and saw that 2067 is also founded on surface 2061 (but again wall and surface do not appear to be bonded together). We lost the plaster surface as we moved northwards towards yet another wall: L2076.       Shifting attention back to the charred surface L2065: having removed the wall L2066 we saw that some of the charred material runs underneath 2066; thus 2066 is later than this surface. We peeled off the char layer 2065 and found a circle of heavily burned cobblestones arranged directly underneath the position of the pot-rest lens. We named these cobbles as L2068. The stones were set in a hard packed red mudbrick-like unit with lots of charcoal bits speckled evenly throughout; we named this part L2062. We later decided that the cobbles plus the hard red charcoal-flecked material constitutes one entity: a hearth. Thus we renamed L2062 and L2068 as L2073 an excavated the hearth as though it were a pit. We troweled back from the edges of the cobbles to find the full dimensions of the hearth and discovered a small, shallow ash pit (L2069) at the south end of L2073. We then cut down into 2073 one half at a time to keep a section going in it. This hearth was constructed of two levels of cobbles with a thin (2-3cm) layer of soil between the layers. After removing the lower layer of cobbles, we were unsure if we had found the base of L2073, so we pressed down on half again. We eventually hit a single, much larger cobble indicating that we had something new (this new cobble will be mentioned again below as part of L2093). We eventually brought down all of 2073 to the elevation of this newly found cobble (2093).      In the course of trying to define the extent of plaster surface L2061, we found another surface 2070. This hard packed pink earthen surface was preserved along the south baulk (and remains visible in section there). When we excavated this part of the trench we cut a lot of 2070 away before we realized what we had. The plaster line of 2061 is not preserved in the SE corner of the trench, although a small bit of the surface 2061 is traceable in the SW corner of the trench by looking at the baulk. An ash lens L2079 adjacent to the west baulk interrupts L2061, but we cannot be sure that it really cuts 2061 as a pit would, because the plaster is so fugitive everywhere else and the ash lens 2079 is so shallow (1cm at most) and ill-formed.       Returning to the probe 2054 we saw that there was another red colored layer; this second one did not have charcoal inclusions like 2062 did. We peeled back the plaster surface 2061 including its greyish brown subsurface fill (this fill was excavated as 2061 because it was bonded to the plaster as a unit). Underneath 2061, the new red crumbly layer of soil L2063 extended out to cover the entire back end of the trench, except for where it was cut by hearth 2073 and charred surface 2065 on top of the hearth. Also, in the SE corner a roughly square-shaped area of bright yellow crumbly soil (L2072) interrupted L2063 red surface in such a way as to create a smooth seam. This yellow soil was almost the exact same thickness as L2063, so we excavated it as a surface, not as a pit. Also the smooth seam between 2072-2063 indicated that the red surface and the yellow surface were constructed contemporaneously; the red soil rounded down and the yellow scooped up to form a neat lip. Once 2063 was fully exposed, we saw that this red surface stops abruptly at the south edge of a mudbrick wall L2076. This abutment 2076-2063 is preserved in both east and west baulks.       We peeled off 2063 to expose the subsurface fill L2078, from which we were eager to collect pottery sherds given the good seal that 2063 offered. We excavated 2078 in parts, leaving an artificial baulk between the hearth 2073 and 2078 around it so that we would not mix contexts. In the SE corner corresponding to the spot underneath L2072, we realized that we had a mudbrick wall (2084) with distinct brick lines in plan and in section. This wall remains pedestaled; we did not fully excavate it this season.      We closed L2078 when we had brought the entire area (under where 2063 had been) down to the level of the first new cobble we had found that makes up L2093. This locus (2093) is a ring of colorful river stones placed slightly to the side of the base of hearth 2073. Therefore we can say that 2093 and 2073 are distinct entities, although 2073 may be a later hearth placed at a similar location. The beaten earth surface that corresponds to 2093 became L2081; this surface had a little bit of plaster preserved at the west baulk but this has been trampled away now. This surface is cut by an ash pit (L2091) in the SW corner; the pit contained some sherds that we lifted from the surface as well as a broken grindstone that remains in situ (it just barely peeks out of the pit soil at this point). Besides the pit 2091 there are three interesting features visible in/cutting surface 2081. An oval shaped crusty orange-ish object (L2094) is peeking out underneath the edge of wall L2084 at the south baulk. We think 2094 may be an oven or possibly some strange kind of brick mortar. Just to the south of 2094 is the ring of cobbles 2093 which may be a hearth. Just to the east of the cobbles and adjacent to the east baulk is a circular shaped ring of pottery sherds (L2090) which may be either a potsmash or a pot that was dropped or a pot that was thrown down or a pot that fell off the table and did not break immediately but was later stomped upon or a pot that was...you get the picture... If this ring of orange material 2090 is not a potsmash, it could be another little oven.       In addition to the three features and a pit found in the surface L2081, we also found three new walls (for which the trench is semi-famous...the trench of never ending walls). Mudbrick wall L2089 runs north-south starting just north of the potsmash 2090 and following the east baulk to where it abuts another mudbrick wall L2087. This wall 2087 runs east-west and we think we have found the end of it because one brick runs into the baulk, a second large pinkish brown brick is fully visible, and the last brick is a crumbly yellow facing brick which is slightly wider that the body brick faces. No bricks extend westward past this yellow brick. To the north of 2087, another mudbrick wall 2088 is visible. This wall is made of large body bricks that have distinct, sharp mortar lines in plan (I love this wall). We peeled off the top two courses of the wall 2076 to the north of L2088 in order to see if they abut or are founded one on top of another. With these two walls flattened at the same elevation, we see that they abut in a clean line. All of these new walls, as well as L2076 remain in situ; we did not fully excavate them this season. In order to find the foundations and width of wall 2076 we did, however, sink a probe 2071 into wall 2076 at the west baulk (in order to try to find brick lines in section).       The second area of focus within the 0-5m step is the place between the front of wall 2076 and the 5m peg where we found a pit 2014 and an oven 2015 last year. We renamed pit 2014 as 2044 and excavated it. While excavating the fill 2057 east of pit 2044 we hit more ash. This ash turned out to be another pit 2058, at the base of which we found a nice toy wheel / spindle whorl. We named the context cut by pit 2058 as 2080 and pressed down. We found another pit 2082 which cut 2080 at the east baulk several cm underneath last year's oven 2015. We also identified an area of mudbrick collapse 2083 resulting from wall 2076-tumble. To the west of 2080, we excavated the context cut by pit 2044 as L2074; 2074 started out as an extension of probe L2071. We saw in the 5m section cut two ash lines which we considered to be the base of 2074. While trying to trace these ash lines we found an impression of a straw / reed basket L2085. This basket impression rests on surface 2092 (we changed L2080 and L2074 to L2092 when we found the impression and isolated the impression as its own locus). We removed the basket impression by creating a casing of plaster and lifted the whole section of soil out of the trench for conservation. This extraction left an artificial pit which allowed us to see the more of the ash lines we had seen earlier in the 5m section cut. We peeled off L2092 to the top of the ash on both sides of the \""basket pit\"" and flattened the pedestal 2105 left behind after removal of the plaster cast-basket. The ash surface is named 2102 in the east and 2103 in the east (they are equal). The ash abuts some entity that we later identified as L2110--a possible new mudbrick wall at the east baulk. The ash 2102 is cut by a large animal burrow L2104. Underneath ash surface 2102+2103 we found a plaster surface 2106 in the east and a mudbrick pavement 2107 in the west. The plaster of 2106 scoops up at the south and east sides, indicating that it is bonded to wall L2076 and the potential wall 2110. Thus these two walls and surface 2106 make a corner. We consider these to be equal also because of the small space they occupy. We excavated L2106 to expose the subsurface fill 2111 below it. Subsurface fill 2111 is cut by an ash entity / pit 2108 which contained some plaster in the top most portion, suggesting that there is some continuity with 2106 here. We excavated 2107 to expose the cobblestone wall foundations 2109 below it. The cobblestones of 2109 at the west baulk lead us to the second area of excavation in A-2 this season: the 5-10m step.          5-10m Step (18 new loci total)      At the 5m peg, we excavated L2075 as mudbrick collapse. This locus contained some large cobblestones L2077. When we were excavating the basket impression 2085, we removed these stones, but actually they are part of the same wall-foundation as 2109. We pressed down the step at the 6-7m peg as L2086. We saw mudbrick bands alternating pink and grey-green in the north cut at the 7m peg, but as we excavated 2086, we could never find brick lines in plan, nor in section. We also pressed down the 1m x 2m area at the 7-8m peg as L2045; this locus is fill above a series of surfaces. The first surface under 2045 is L2047+2048 which we recognized as a surface by the potsmash 2046 located at the east baulk on 2047. We removed this surface and found more flat lying sherds and charcoal bits on surface 2049. We brought L2075 and L2086 down to the same elevation as L2049 at which point we saw ash at the east baulk. We named this ashy area L2095 and excavated it as a pit; it turned out to be fugitive ash lenses that were difficult to define and spread out all over the east half of the step and into the west half. We named the soil the ash lenses rested upon/cut 2096.       Together with 2095, 2096 constitutes a layer of ash-filled occupational debris above a surface 2100. We recognized a new surface because the east baulk showed a sharp transition from ash to red soil and we found a flat-lying grindstone / doorpost at the 8m peg. We decided to treat one persistent ash lens as a pit L2099 at the east baulk adjacent to where we found the flat lying doorpost/grindstone resting on 2100. We pressed down 2100 and changed to L2101, subsurface fill. One small area of L2100 remains pedestalled at the end of the season: at the west baulk and the 8m peg. This part of the step showed brick lines in section but we were unable to find brick lines in plan nor by cutting into the soil from the east. We still are not sure if there is a wall here or not.       The narrow step at the 8m peg was excavated as L2064 subtopsoil. This is where we saw brick lines of L2100-west pedestaled portion.    Another narrow step at the 8.5m peg was excavated as L2050 subtopsoil. As we cut this step we exposed a wide band of black ashy soil at the west baulk; we peeled back L2064 to identify the ash; it appears to be charred mudbrick and next year's excavators should treat it as its own thing. We also saw brick lines in plan once we exposed the top of the ash area on the 2064 step. These bricks should correspond with whatever entity is pedestalled in 2100. We could not successfully identify the features at this 8m peg, which frustrated us. Maybe next year's excavations can answer some of the questions we merely raised this year.      Between the 10m - 11m pegs, we pressed down as fill layer L2060. At the base of this step we saw two lines of cobbles. We peeled back the soil in the 9-10m step as L2060 to come down on top of the cobble layers. Just above the cobbles, we hit harder soil and changed locus to L2097. We removed 2097 to expose a pebble surface 2098 that extends between the 9m peg to the 10m peg and may continue into the step left over at the 9m cut (below 2050).         10-25m Steps (4 new loci total)      From the 12m peg we cut topsoil 2043 down step by step down to the 25m peg. We also dug some subtopsoil 2064 at the 16m, 17m, and 19m peg. We found one interesting feature L2055 at the 13m peg: a row of large cobbles ending at the east with a huge flagstone. We believe this may be the remnants of a wall foundation or maybe a burial. The stones remain in situ; we did not remove 2055 this season.      In the end we did not complete as much of the second trench step as we had hoped we would. We think next year's excavators should still try to press down in the 0-5m step to get more of the good contexts showing up there.

This trench is located in the lower north-eastern part of Kenan Tepe and was a 10x10. This trench is bordered by two 5x5 trenches: on the East by F2 and on the South by F9. One 5x10 (F8) lies to the southeast of trench F7. F7 was opened specifically as the result of last years excavations in F2. They found a cobbled surface in the baulk that continued West. This is where F7 is located. This year we encountered the first level of occupation. We moved about 1 meter of dirt in the western half of the trench and 1/2 meter in the eastern half. The difference between the two is mainly due to the natural slope of this area. The trench was practically level when it was closed.      Excavation this year can be summarized by dividing the trench into 3 main areas: the eastern half, the southwestern corner, and the northwestern corner. The eastern half can be characterized as an area of many surfaces, occupational debris, and two burials. The southwestern quarter was mainly topsoil with some rock features that may have indicated surfaces, but if so these surfaces were poorly preserved and not found in excavation. This area is also characterized by a mud-brick structure that extends into the northwester quarter of the trench. The northwestern quarter of the trench can be characterized by 2 pits, one partially preserved surface, and a portion of the mudbrick structure.       We started excavating the eastern half of the trench by assigning the topsoil visibly disturbed by plow furrows as topsoil fill L7000. We pushed through this layer of topsoil fill in the northeastern corner, and then decided to open a 2x2 sounding level in this corner in order to find the cobbled surface as soon as possible. We assigned the fill between the topsoil and the surface as L7003. We found the cobbled surface we were looking for about 30 cms. underneath the topsoil. This surface was one of 5 that were found in this half of the trench. In excavation it was found that surface L7005 was partially sealed by a later surface, L7040, and both L7005 and L7040 were sealed by surface L7010. In excavating these surfaces, we took flotation samples of L7005 and L7010. We also took soil samples from various areas of the surfaces for possible future chemical analysis. All of the chemical soil samples that were taken on August 14, 2001 and August 18, 2001, the days we removed these 2 surfaces, are plotted on supplementary dayplans.       Parallel to these surfaces further south in the trench, there was one area that was marked by many layers of pottery debris lying on a surface. These pottery debris layers, which include loci L7009, L7018, L7023, L7025, and L7026, were characterized by significant amounts of hard-packed, flat-lying pottery. It was only after excavating L7009 that we realized there were many layers of this pottery debris. The excavator would peel one layer off and find the next layer directly beneath it. This was consistent for 5 layers, and then we finally found surface L7030. There was another surface that fits this profile that was found perpendicular to L7030. This was assigned as surface L7024. A direct connection was not found in excavation, there was a space of about 10 centimeters between these surfaces, however both surfaces were characterized by a large amount of flat-lying pottery and they lay in a 90 degree relationship to one another. Both of these surfaces were excavated on August 14, 2001. Flotation soil samples and soil chemical analysis samples were taken and plotted on supplementary dayplans.       After all of these surfaces were excavated, we opened their subfloor fill loci. For L7010, it was L7036, for L7030, it was L7037, and for L7024, the subfloor fill was L7038. L7036 partially covered surface L7005 and completely sealed L7040. After excavating L7040, no subfloor fill layer was assigned as surface L7005 lay directly beneath it. After excavating L7005, subfloor fill L7045 was named. This subfloor fill was left on the last day of excavation. Special attention should be paid to this area as it was a datable, sealed portion of the trench.       A human cranium was also found in the northeastern corner of the trench. It was assigned as locus 7006. This burial cut surface L7005 and so we had to excavate this area a little differently in order to extract the burial. We had to cut into the eastern baulk by 25 cms and the northern baulk by 75 cms. In order to bring this as of yet unexcavated portion of the trench down to the level of the burial, we had to name a topsoil layer locus L7011, a sub-topsoil layer locus L7012, and finally the fill around the burial as L7013. We also had to take a portion of the cobbled surface out earlier than the rest, so a 1x1 area of L7005 was renamed as locus L7016 and taken out. The subfloor fill layer to L7016 was named as locus L7017, which is equal to subfloor fill L7045. Also, photos were taken of the complete surface excavated to that point with total station points. On the other side of L7005 we named a fill locus of L7007.       The burial L7006 was actually excavated by Amy. The burial was a child that was situated on an east-west axis. It took her 3 days to completely extract the burial. The skeleton was KT'd as 7178.       We kept taking down elevation in the eastern part of the trench and went through arbitrary fill layers L7020 and L7035. We found a few more things in the southern end of the trench as a result of excavating the fill layers. In the middle of the eastern part of the trench, on the last day of excavation, we found a very large circular pit. It was assigned locus L7043 although it was never excavated. We also found an area that had a very large concentration of redeposited virgin soil. It was thought that this may have been some sort of structure, so we assigned it as locus 7039 and sectioned it to see what it was. We found nothing to suggest it was a structure, so the last day of excavation, we leveled the entire locus and closed it.       The only other thing to note in this area of the trench was the discovery of another burial. It is located in the far southeastern part of the trench towards the center. This burial was assigned as locus L7028 and was not excavated this season due to the abundance of burials and not enough time. There were a few fragments that had broken off of the cranium that I collected at the end of the season. They were KT'd as 7315.       The southwestern quarter of the trench was not characterized by much in the first part of the season. We pushed down elevation in topsoil fill layer L7001 and we found what we thought might be a surface in a cluster of rocks. We made it locus L7002, but excavation did not turn up an associated surface. Either it was a surface that was not preserved, or just an anomoly. We named a sub-topsoil fill layer as locus 7004 and kept pushing down elevation. We went through another fill layer without finding anything substantial. The fill layer was locus L7019. In pushing down all of this elevation, we inadvertently pedastled a small group of rocks. They were not associated with any surface, or anything else for that matter. We assigned it as locus 7027 so that we could level it and KT whatever we found in it. We also found an area that was composed of one large rock conglomerate and a poorly preserved surface. We named this area L7014. This locus continued to stay in the southern part of the trench while we named another fill layer, L7032, and continued to push down elevation. When we pushed down we realized that there was a soil change in the middle of this area. It was reddish in color, and ran in a linear fashion parallel to the western baulk. We scraped the area and found a linear feature that was perpendicular to the original reddish area. It was determined that this mass was a wall, and probably an entire structure. We pushed back L7014 to uncover the other corner. This group of mudbrick walls is very faint. It would be easy to miss, but it's exact location and elevation is plotted on the final day plan. Once we figured out it was a wall, we cut a section right through the center of it. This section encompassed the wall and the surrounding fill. This was locus L7034. We also dug a probe in the fill next to the northwest corner of the wall. This was to try and see if we could detect any mortar lines or individual bricks. We went down 10 cms but had no success and closed this locus at the end of the season. This too, is plotted on the final day plan.       The northwestern corner is the last area to discuss in detail. We pushed down elevation with the same fill layers as the southwestern quarter...L7001, L7004, L7019, and L7032. Early in the excavation process we uncovered what was a cluster of rocks and pottery that seemed to indicate a surface. This was assigned as locus L7008, but excavation did not turn up anything else to indicate a surface. We found two pits in this area of the trench. These were assigned as loci L7021 and L7022. We excavated both and they appeared to both be rather shallow, so I closed them during the season. As we continued taking down the elevation, it became apparent that we had not full excavated pit 7021, so we reopened it as pit L7042, but by this point there was no time for further excavation. Pit L7021/7042 cuts a surface that we found against the north baulk. This was surface L7029. It extended east, and there seemed to be a tenuous connection with surface L7005 in the northeastern area of the trench, but nothing concrete. The fill between this surface and fill L7007 in the northeastern part of the trench was assigned as L7031. L7029 was excavated, but no soil samples were taken as it was not a sealed surface. After the surface was taken off we found what looks to be the beginning of another surface. We assigned this locus as L7044. This would be a sealed surface, so attention should be paid to this area. It is also cut by pit L7042. Both are unexcavated, but on the final dayplan.       During excavation this year I found 10 grindstones, 8 of which were found in fill, and 2 within surface L7005. I found one obsidian blade, one glass rim, one spindle whorl, one half circle of basalt, one metal pin and one possible stone tool in fill loci.      This year of excavation allowed us to encounter the first occupational level in F7. It was characterized by many surfaces littered with pottery debris in the eastern half of the trench, pits and poorly preserved surfaces in the northwestern quarter, and some sort of mudbrick structure in the southwestern quarter of the trench. I feel like I am dealing with some sort of outside occupational area in the eastern half of the trench and the northwestern quarter of the trench. I am not surprised to find what looks to be a mudbrick structure in the center of the southwestern area as nothing was ever found in that region of the trench. Hopefully next year we can come to a clearer understanding of what the context of F7 is as we push down into earlier occupational layers.       Because we did not move a significant amount of dirt this season, there is not a lot in my baulks. We did not draw any F7 sections this year. Right now they show a lot of varied topsoil fill layers. Many of the features in my trench were in the center and therefore do not show up in the baulk. Surface L7005, L7030, and L7029 all intersected the baulks, but only left a few cobbles as reminders of their existence.       At the end of the season, all of the major surfaces were removed. What was left to be plotted in the final dayplan included the sealed subfloor fill layer L7045, pits L7043 and L7042, burial L7028, surface L7044, and the mudbrick structure...L7033. A mudbrick structure showed up in F9's northern baulk, which was drawn, which may extend to the southwestern area of F7. If that is the case, we are only a few centimeters above where that should take place, so the next excavator should be aware of that. The last locus number used this year was L7045 and the last KT# was 7317. I feel as though this trench was successful for an exploratory first year with many possibilities for next year.

We spent the morning cleaning and then spent the rest of the day identifying and opening loci.    L7046 was opened first because it had been pedestaled from the previous year and we wanted to take down the elevation.    L7047 seems to be a new surface, so we left this pedestaled in the trench until we   can excavate it further.   L7048 is fill in the NE corner that was at a lower elevation.   Another surface was coming up in the north area of the trench. This is locus 7049.    There are two pits that will be excavated tomorrow: L7050 and L7051.    The walls of the structure that was coming up last year are clearly visible and are now L7053. The probe that we did last year is still at a lower elevation and was opened as L7052.   The fill surrounding the outside of the structure is L7056 and the fill on the inside is L7057. These are both large loci but will be used for cleaning debris left over from the off season. After we remove a few centimeters the fill will be re-evaluated and separated accordingly.   The cranium from last years burial is missing, but there were some bones visible in the surrounding fill. The burial is L7054 (the actual skeleton) and the fill surrounding the burial is L7055. The bones comprising the skeleton that we collected are KT #7327. We will leave this area mainly for Rick_Ñés bone team to excavate.   Today the workmen took down L7046 to the same elevation as L7048. Tomorrow we will close it and it should be the same locus as fill L7048.

The purpose of this trench is to investigate second millennium contexts and link them with an earlier, possibly third millennium phase. The step trench will be excavated by reducing the highest step to the level of the next lowest step, and then reducing this combined area to the level of the next lowest step. This will result in an expanded area totaling some eight by two meters       The early part of the day was taken up by laying out marking string, and cleaning in preparation for excavations. Excavations concentrated on cleaning the topsoil and sub-topsoil from the lowest step, since these were not cleaned up entirely during last season_Ñés work. Otherwise all other steps have been cleaned of topsoil. The topsoil has been designated as locus 1. This locus consists of yellow-brown loose dirt, which is semi-compact in places.

Before starting to excavate photos have been taken to make sure that nothing has been removed from its place.

L7050 was originally thought to be irregular in shape, but as excavation progressed it appeared to be circular in form with some hard material on the surface (maybe debris from off season elements?) As Cengis excavated the texture of the dirt changed to a clayish substance _ÑÐ we did not change loci because we weren_Ñét sure if the clay deposit was something that had been dumped into the pit. We did, however, change KT bags and continued excavation. After taking off another layer of about 5 cms, Cengis found quite a bit of flat lying pottery sherds and bones possibly indicating a surface. It appears to me as though the initial pit was shallow and that we have completely dug through it. We will officially close this locus tomorrow.   Pit L7051 was very similar to pit L7050. After the initial 5 cms of silty loam, the dirt changed to a harder clayish substance. Once again, we did not change loci, but we did change KT bags. After another layer of excavation, the soil remained clayish so we sectioned the pit and opened L7058 in order to provide us with a window into what was going on. During the next step of excavation, there was a white ashy area that came up and we took a sample (KT 7346). After digging about 10 more cms of the same clay substance we determined that we probably were dealing with another shallow pit and that we had completely excavated it. This pit will also be officially closed tomorrow.   We also started taking down elevation in L7056 by about 3-5 cms. There was an area of virgin soil that appeared near the south baulk. We will evaluate this after we have removed the dirt from the entire locus.   We also started excavating L7049 to see where it led. It appears to be going south towards the center of the trench in a diagonal manner. Interesting to note: we are finding a lot (over 5) lithic remains in this locus.

Because of this we will shoot the points (the corners) of trench again just to make it much more clear. Our dayplans reflect an ideal 5x10meter trench, and all measurements are taken from the north west corner.

L5079 revealed what is apparently a plaster surface or basin; adjacent to and abutting (in its concave way) the other areas of the surface which 5079 appears to be the fill immediately upon. Among interesting finds from the locus were an in situ extensive remains of a small animal. Whether it is an invasive rodent or perhaps the remains of a small bird of some sort is not apparent at this time. A portion of the skeleton was excavated (KT 5522).

This was caused because of the substantial topsoil in locus 1, which is particularly abundant at the border between A8 and A9. The lowest step was reduced to the level of the top baulk of A9, which is located immediately to the north of A8. Although, topsoil was not breached at this point, a cobble lining or installation is visible in the lowest baulk of A8, which is effectively the bulk of the lowest step. In addition as small stone pendant or loom weight with a perforation was found near the cobbles. Photos were taken and work relocated to the top step at approximately 15 meters from the summit.      Assuming that locus 2042 in A2 represented topsoil, locus 2 was designated as sub-topsoil for the top layer of the top step. This semi-compact brown clay-like fill immediately divided into a reddish fill in the east (locus 3) and a darker organic fill in the west (locus 4). This was not visible from the outset but is clear in the southern section. These fills are eroded to the north where a substantial amount of locus 2 is mixed with residual topsoil, probably 2043. Consequently a small lower step was created due to the erosion of earlier layers loci 2 and 4, and the deposition of later fills 2043 and 2, lower in the mound. Locus 2 was successfully completed.

We are still working on the L4046, and while w were working on this locus we found a bull figurine that has the KT number as 4275. The locus 4046 is an \L\ shaped locus. This \L\ shaped locus will have two new locia numbers . Because of having a collapse of mud-bricks in a pit, the locus number of the pit is 40 48, and the part of the east sides locus is 4049. While we were excavating L4049 we have found a second small find in this locus that has the KT as 4284 and it is worked stone. Also I have taken a soil sample of the mud-brick from L4048, because it seemed to be oxidized.      After all these, we have traced the edges of the pit (L4048) and we have cleaned it.

When we reached a meter in depth and still were in topsoil, I swept and cleaned and took a progress photo. We later found some large potsherds but none were flat lying. After cleaning the area we came upon some mudbrick debris distributed in clumps around the 2m area. There are some flat lying sherds.

Work was also started in L7057, another large area of fill on the interior of the structure L7053. We are also just taking down the elevation by a few centimeters (2-3) so we can scrape off debris from the off season and get a good look about the area inside of L7053. L7057 is partly a  eal\ locus in that it is the area contained within the 3 visible walls and partly arbitrary in that we extended the locus borders to the eastern baulk even though we don_Ñét yet know where the structure ends. Hopefully by scraping around in this area we will be more equipped to define the borders via a clearer picture of the walls.   Work was also started on both of the surfaces in the northern half of the trench. We defined both of their boundaries and screened the material collected from both. L7049 had 2 buckets of dirt/material to screen and L7047 had 5 buckets of material to screen. Within a day or two we will collect samples to perform a microanalysis on these two surfaces. L7047 is irregular in shape. L7049 looks as though it is circular. After speaking with Andy, the idea was mentioned that perhaps it is a filled in pit rather than a surface. We will keep it in mind during the excavation of this locus. L7049 does not extend to L7053.   Cengis began articulating the bones in burial L7054. He exposed part of the cranium, some of the finger bones and part of the hip and the leg. The skeleton appears to by lying on its right side facing south.

Some rocks started appearing in the northeastern quadrant of the trench during the cleaning of L7056. There is a small surface that appears to have been cut by L7050. We will continue excavating and look for possible additional relationships to other loci in the trench.     ,~: F-7-2002-07-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7047,"578,2002-07-04," D-4-2002-07-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4047,","   Area D Trench 4 July 4, 2002          We started to our day by taking the photos of the locus 4048 (the pit being located to the south side of the sounding D3). We started to excavate the west baulk of D3, it has the locus number as 4050. While we were excavating here, a row of rock began to show up, so I have closed the L4050, and the rocks that began to show up here have their new locus number as 4051. We are able to see some ceramic and potsherds here in between the stones. The potsherds between the stones will help us in dating the rocks.       During the cleaning process of L4051 we began to take the pit out (L4048). It took much more time to get rid off the pit then being supposed, because the  conditions have caused the soil to become harder. Because of this we can say that the mud-bricks got very fast tied with the soil. But we were able to find nicely preserved bone pieces, their KT number is 4. There is another KT bag that should be mentioned too and it is from L4050 (the west baulk of D3) and it is the 9th KT bag of this locus. It is shell, but I think that it is a part of an actual mother of pearl, because it very hard to be a normal shell. It is bright pink and bit thick.       I have closed the pit and I have opened a new locus that includes almost the whole south baulk of D3. This new locus is 4052, but it does not have the pit in it, so it is only the east side of the south baulk of D3. L4052 is at the same level with my last year locias 4041 and 4042. These two locias were sealed, so I think that the new locus will be sealed too (L4052), but L4042 was unsealed, it was only equal with L4041. Before closing for today I have taken a few photos of L4051 (the rocks) and L4052.       Our aim for tomorrow is to set up the spider for L4051, and then taking them out. After then I will be excavating on my locias from last year but I will be giving new locias to them.                      ,~: D-4-2002-07-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4047,"579,2002-07-04," A-9-2002-07-04 (2) from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,","   Daily Trench     Area A   Trench 9    July 4, 2002         We began digging topsoil from the 2m mark to the 4m mark going about 10cm at a time. We will try to clear all topsoil from the 4m section today. We also began digging a new locus, L2 in the first 2m of the trench. I split the area in half east to west and dug about 20cm down to see what was below the mudbrick debris and animal holes. We found a line of darker reddish brown soil that starts at the point that I began L2. The soil is harder packed than L1 but it is still coarse. We cleaned and found that the east side of the locus near the baulk is softer than the west as you go down North the colors disappear and we are back in topsoil. We continued west to the west baulk but stopped at the beginning of topsoil around 1.25cm from the South baulk.       We started digging from the 4-8m peg and went 20cm to start clearing the topsoil, which is still L1. I switched bags to KT 10, 11 and 15.    In L2 I cleared the last hunk of what I thought was top soil at the NW corner. It appeared to be the same color as the reddish brown soil in the south that was harder packed. Upon further investigation, the last half meter or so of the 2m step is a lot softer than the soil against the South baulk. We marked the area and went down about 5cm. I changed KT bags to 16 and 17 for this area to avoid mixing. Found nothing new so we cut the area in half east to west and dug another 10cm on the east side. The soil is the same color as the top 2m and there is no change. I decided to cut into the hard areas and level the entire east half of L2 to the northern soft area. Went back to the original KT bags 12-14.       We cleared almost 1m of topsoil in 4-8m part of the trench. The topsoil is the same as the previous 4m. We are trying to create another step and stop right after we finish topsoil. We went far today in the 4-6m section and we will level the step to the 8m peg.   Back to L2, after leveling the east half of the trench I decided to level the entire 2 x 2m area. First we started with the soft part in the North section (KT 16-17) and then continued to the South Baulk with the original KT bags.

Locus 3 is a semi-compact reddish fill containing some bones and a few sherds and flakes. Mud brick debris of a reddish-orange and green color is found throughout. Initial excavation could not determine the orientation of the mud brick, and no pattern could be determined. Work moved to locus 4 in the west.      Locus 4 is a darker organic fill with substantial pottery and bone remains and occasional flakes. Mud brick debris was abundant and eventually resolved to form an east-west alignment or wall. The wall, designated as locus 5, consists of at least 2 courses of both green and orange-red brick. The northern side of the wall showed another row of brown bricks in the fill/surface at the foot of the wall. This may alternatively represent a foundation trench. Scraping of this fill surface (locus 7) northwards will hopefully clarify this assumption tomorrow.      The south side of the wall yielded a softish clay-like bright orange fill, which will be excavated as locus 6. If the northern foot of wall locus 5 represents a foundation trench excavation of locus 6 should elaborate on this. Another possible wall runs north-south from the south section and abuts wall locus 5. This needs to be further investigated.      Lastly work continued in locus 3. Mud brick debris could not be clarified and all but the south western corner was reduced to the level of locus 7. Work will continue to the north of wall locus 5 in locus 7 tomorrow.

The primary revelation of the day in that regard was that the surface did not continue any further to the N or E and that we may, in fact, even have an intact corner of it there. The absence of any wall-like structure, especially in the E, is somewhat concerning. The area to the N of the plaster was redesignated L5085 when this was discovered.   In other parts of the trench, to the E L5084 was further excavated revealing no less than 3 more pedestal bases, bringing the total number in that portion of the trench. Preliminary in-situ looks date some of them to the 3rd millennium, whereas same in L5079 is equivalent 2nd millennium. How 1000 years are covered in 80 cm with little vertical change is vexing. Hopefully as we continue to excavate the area between the two the disconnect will reveal itself.   Also of note was the removal of L5086, synonomous with last season_Ñés L5066. It_Ñés removal and subsequent continued digging there (as L5087) indicates that the surface of L5079 does not continue and, in fact, the feature hinting at does exist.

They differed greatly so I am re-shooting them. I am trusting today_Ñés elevations because they were checked by another person. This is something I_Ñéll keep a close eye on the next couple of days. We started by shaving some of the erosion away from the areas around the wall L3068 in the East of the trench and cleaning the entire trench. I made cleaning locus, L3067, for this which includes all the loci on the E half of the trench. Everything in this locus is mixed. We also found a very small amount of carbon C.3.3067.3474 and C.3.3067.3477 while shaving, it is probably not worth looking at because it will not be diagnostic for my trench. After cleaning we took off L3065 which is the fill layer directly W of the large, 9m N-S running wall 3068 in the east half of the trench. We are taking it off because we want to see if there is a surface underneath it. In L3065 we found a piece of carbon KT3480. After removing the locus we started to remove L3069 which is the locus underneath L3965. We started removing it at a level that could be seen in the section. This could be a surface because the dirt that comprises it is hard packed, possibly from occupation or foot trafic, the locus underneath, L3070, is very hard. It might be associated with Wall, L3068.      ,~: C-3-2002-07-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,"583,2002-07-04," C-2-2002-07-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2103,","   07/04/2002   C2   Daily       Began the season by \stringing\ in the actual trench, this was done because the actual trench is off the grid. This is because of baulk cleaning in 2001 and the outlaying of the trench in was done without the help of a total station in 2000.   At the same time a quick cleaning of the surfaces in the trench was done. So the actual work could be started.    Took top levels for the entire trench. After which I opened L2103. This locus replaced earlier loci: L2085, L2090, L2093, L2096 and L2101. This was done because I was not able to differentiate the loci precisely, as the sun had \baked\ the surface into uniform mass (10 YR 7/1). During the process of excavating the top 5 cm off the designated area I uncovered pottery KT 2754, some animal bones KT 2755, lithic KT 2756, three patches of carbon samples labeled KT 2757, KT 2758 and KT 2762. Two bags of possible plaster samples KT 2760 and KT 2761.    The northern end of the loci produced two patches of carbon samples KT 2757 and KT 2758, while KT 2762 came from the southern end of the locus, L2103.

We made a second step in the trench that helps us to get rid off from the topsoil and sub topsoil, but we had to keep in mind the differences of level in the north and in the south of the trench.    We have found another surface. This surface starts from the north of the oven and goes to the south of the oven from the backside of the oven. This new surface is locus 3, only a bit of this layer is visible in front of the oven. The reason for this is being at the slope of the tepe. Everything on the first step is sub topsoil, but the oven and the surface are not included to the locus of the sub topsoil. The sub topsoil is locus 4.

Continued the work that was begun on L2103 yesterday. Took much needed photos of the locus. As we (myself and two workmen) continued to remove the soil we uncovered pottery, KT 2763, animal bones, KT 2764, and lithics KT 2765. Besides from these we uncovered two shells, KT 2766. I took 6 carbon samples, KT # 2767, 2768, 2771, 2772, 2773 and 2778. Of potential interest is carbon sample KT 2772, as it comes from the area that formerly L2085, an area of wall tumble, which was removed.    A note about the bones and charcoal: A lot of this came from the area along the east baulk, ca. one liter was sampled, KT 2774. The finds in this area could be the remnants of the already known ash pit. This pit was partly excavated last year.    On the northern part of the east baulk, we saw something that might look like mudbrick. But further investigation wrote off that possibility.    Again we found a small amount of possible plaster, KT 2769. Some interesting dirt was sampled as well KT 2771.    Needless to say, L2103 is a very mixed locus, but it served its purpose as a cleaning locus. But it gave an indication of where we should put the loci afterwards.   The ashy dark area that produced the charcoal and burnt bones was photographed at the end of the day.    After this I opened L2104. This locus is equal to L2048. Did some cleaning, scraping between the stones of this wall. This produced some finds: Pottery KT 2775, animal bones KT 2776 and lastly lithics KT 2777.

We will level the west have of the locus another few centimeters. My goal is to level the south half of the step to the north half in the next 2 days.   We split L2 into 2 parts L3 and L4. L3 is the south 1.28m of the area which is hard packed red brown soil. L4 is the softer loosely packed red brown soil. Because the differences between the areas became more and more clear, I thought it was best to separate the two entities. We began digging in L4 starting with 10cm down on the east side looking for some answers in the section. Finding nothing new we continued to level the area.    In L1 we dug another 20cm and cut into more of the red brown soil in the 4-8m area. Could this be a floor if it extends this far? Probably not.

The wall has resolved further into a definite north-south orientation. The east-west direction was initially assumed because the wall appears to be thicker than first anticipated. The darker material at the northern foot of the wall seems to be mortar in the joins. In order to pick up the wall further to the north a further step was created. Indeed this move discovered bricks in a mixed deposit of locus 7 with pockets of sub-topsoil locus 4. Another black burnish piece (this time an out-turned jar) was found in this context following the carinated bowl found yesterday in locus 4 (?).      To confirm the orientation of the wall, excavation of locus 6 was commenced. The orange fill proved to be part of the wall, which was difficult to determine during the excavation but was evident in the sections. Generally the bricks are difficult to arrange because they are multi-colored and the joins are not always visible.      The trench seems to be divided between the wall in the west, a darker channel, or trench in the center, and the reddish fill in the east, all running from north to south.

While talking with Andy I had a thought snout the discontinuous pebble surfaces west of the N side of the wall L3068.

Next week we will mainly work on defining the area of the walls.         ,~: F-7-2002-07-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7047,"595,2002-07-06," A-8-2002-07-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench    Area A   Trench 8   July 6, 2002      Work continued in locus 7 north and quickly reached a gray mottle layer, which appears to be fairly clean and unmixed with later fills. This locus was designated locus 10.      Work then refocused on loci 3 and 8, the east and central layers respectively. Locus 3, lying against the eastern baulk yielded a reddish mottle surface bounded on the west by mud bricks aligned in a north south orientation. This alignment also appears to contain a corner brick, which turns to the eastern baulk in the center of the trench.       Locus 8, underlying the dark fill of locus 4 is situated between the reddish fill locus 3 in the east and the wall locus 5 in the west. Locus 8 is a dark channel of semi-loose earth. It produced substantial mud brick debris, either belonging to one or both of the parallel walls or representing one and the same construction. A zigzag between the debris appears to be a rodent burrowing.    South of the wall alignment on the west of locus 3, excavation of locus 8 descended on locus 10, the same gray mottle layer seen in the west. However locus 10 is higher and earlier in this location compared to locus 7. This layer contained a few sherds and lenses of red fill in the east where it encroaches on locus 9.      Locus 9 was excavated as the red mottled clay like layer to the north of the brick alignment corner associated with the bottom of locus 3. It produced few artifacts and gave way to the gray mottled fill, locus 10.      Further work will investigate the true extent of wall locus 5 by peeling back the step towards the southern bulk. Following this, excavation will concentrate elaborating the south-eastern corner in order to locate an associated surface belonging to either the brick alignment or wall locus 5.      ,~: A-8-2002-07-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,"596,2002-07-06," F-1-2002-07-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1057,","   Daily Trench    Area F   Trench 1   July 6, 2002      We started this day by taking many soil samples. The reason for these soil samples is that, again, last year we had a large black ashy layer of doom. Said ashy layer had been deposited upon the baked clay surface. Although the surface appears to be very clean, with a limited amount of pottery and bone, we wanted to do various tests on the soil. So that it is remembered exactly what we did I am going to write it down. Andy, if you are reading this sometime in the future then I hope this helps. All soil samples came from locus 1060, which was basically the majority of the trench encircling the former oven. These soil samples were taken for three reasons. Some were taken for flotation (KT_Ñés 8-10 and 14-16). Other samples were taken for chemical analysis (11, 17-19, 23). Still other samples were taken for micro artifact analysis (KT numbers 12-13, 21-22). Many of these soil samples come from the surface near the oven, while others are just part of the surface, which is still a good place for soil sampling since the black ashy layer of doom was deposited on this surface.      Then we continued to push down on this surface where all of the black ash had fallen in the past. Since this surface appeared to cover most of the trench we continued to excavate it as one locus. Hopefully we can better understand this area after blasting through this surface. The surface may have been an outside one; at the very least it was a huge baked surface area. This area where the ashy layer fell didn_Ñét give us tons of artifacts, as it looks as though it was kept very clean.       We spent the last little while of the day troweling the entire trench to make it more level. After this surface is removed it should make it easier to look for changes. Right near the end of the day it looked as though we may have a color change, which may turn into a pit, we shall see in two days.

Firstly, the immediate flat-lying sherds of L5079 were removed. Among these sherds (KT 5554 and 5555) there is at least partial reconstruction possibility, along with KTs 5094.1 and 5094.11. The locus was changed after the removal of the top-level of the surface. That there was more material was surprising at the time. However, this led to a (possible) revalation_ÑÓthe plaster feature is not a surface but, in fact, the exterior covering of a collapsed mudbrick wall, which would also explain why thinly-plastered mudbrick wall L5087 petered out for no apparent reason. This theory is furthered by the facts that a) L5087 peters out just as the plaster feature begins to appear; and b) closer inspection reveals mudbrick-like material underneath the plaster.   But back to the earlier point, the pottery on the surface was prelimilarily identified as Ubaid (sp?), which being 4th millennium doesn_Ñét solve the issue of the 3rd millennium pedestal bases to the east and being in a more shallow context, it does legitimately open up the possibility of them being (maybe ancient) surface tumble.   Surely the largest find of the day was the remains of a fabric in the same (Ubaid) context. Preservation was excellent given the age and the warp and weave could easily be seen. It was also successfully articulated to reveal it lying over an object, possibly a mudbrick. Impressions and pieces which could not be kept in situ were retained in KT 5094.8. Tomorrow some method will have to be devised to remove it from the trench. The current plan is to do similar to what was done on the basket impression in A2 last year. That is, pedestal the feature then slowly and carefully hammer a metal plate under it and hopefully remove it in tact. On a similar note, we are making calls to curators and ancient fabric/reed mat experts for advice on curation of the material.   Near the fabric we also located some of what appear to be seed or similar material. However, as they looked too fragile to float, we took them out with their matrix and brought it back as KT 5094.16.   Also of note from the context were an obsidian blade (KT 5094.5) and a couple possible partial pots with their contents (KT 5094.11 and 5094.12).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,~: D-5-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5079,"601,2002-07-07," A-9-2002-07-07 (2) from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Area A   Trench 9   Week 1   July 7, 2002      Trench A9 is located below A8 and is part of what used to be A2. It is a step trench running down the North side of the Kenan Tepe mound. Trench A9 is located 25m from the top of the tepe and ends at the 41m mark at the bottom of the tepe, the measurement for the entire trench is 2m wide by 16m long. I will not be referencing areas in my trench by their relation to the top of the tepe. I will call the first 1-4m of the trench the 1-4m step and so on.    We began digging on July 2, 2002 in topsoil which is L1. The topsoil is the same all the way down the mound so this locus will extend all the way down the mound.    Below the topsoil is a reddish brown clayey loam soil that becomes shallower as you proceed north down the tepe slope. The top layer of L2 looked like mudbrick debris and was riddled with animals holes and roots. At the first 1-4 meters of the trench the red brown soil is divided into soft, loosely packed parts (L4) and hard more compacted parts (L3). The distinction between these two soil consistencies was not seen until we went down about 10-15cm in L2 at the top 1-2m of the trench.   L4 is located in the North .72m of 1-2m step. Its is much softer reddish brown soil than the abutting L3 but as you go down about 15cm it becomes harder packed and almost identical to L3.    L3 is the South 1.28m of the 1-2m step. We excavated about 10cm of it but avoided the areas that are very hard and compact to investigate whether there are any mudbricks or a possible floor. The hard packed soil area is located at the SW corner of the 1-2m step.   In the 4-8m step we have cut through all the topsoil (L1) and reached the reddish brown soil (L2). In this area the soil is uniformly soft and loose but it is the same color and consistency as the top 1-4m of the trench.    In the 8-12m section of the trench we have just begun to clear topsoil in L1. We have dug about 40cm of the the 8-10m section.    We moved a lot of topsoil this week but my goal is to have all of the topsoil removed from the entire length of the trench by the end of next week, and be low enough in the first 4m to get into contexts.            ,~: A-9-2002-07-07 (2) from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,"602,2002-07-07," C-3-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,","   C 3 Daily  July 7, 2002      Today we took out the rest of L3069 revealing the rest of L3070 which is the locus W of wall L3068. Nothing much was there. After that was removed we dug L3071 which is a exploratory trench 1m N from the S baulk and directly abutting wall L3068. We dug this in order to find the surface associated with the wall L3068 and be able to follow it in L3070, which it cuts. After digging the locus I found that we could see the surface in the section of the baulk and that we had already cut through it last season and so this trench was unnecessary. Fortunately it revealed a rather large foundation trench&gt; will check tomorrow if there is any surface in the section. We started to dig the pit L3064 that comes out of the baulk about 50cm or so about 3m N of the S baulk. The worker was a bit confused and dug about 5cm off of L3063 directly outside of the pit. Fortunately he found a surface and followed it. It is possible that this is the surface is the one associated on the E with the wall L3068 but it is possible that L3060 is the surface. Tomorrow I will articulate the wall and have a very close look. Here we also found a carbon sample C.3.3063.2002. We got everything sorted out and the worker dug the pit but he dug past 10-15 cm where the pit ended which was not a problem because it gave us a look into what was coming up. This means that the pottery from this pit for this day is mixed between 2nd millennium and later pottery, the 2nd millennium coming from the part of the pit that the worker dug through. It seems a hard packed surface that we traced back to L3057 and found it just stating to appear. We can see a distinct difference between the looser dirt matrix of the Early Iron that we are coming out of and the hard packed clayey matrix, which is the starting of the 2nd millennium surfaces. The hard clayey level will be the next major level that we will aim for when digging after removing the wall, L3068. Also we found what looked to be a 2nd millennium ribbed pottery shard at the bottom on the surface, which was not removed. Also in this pit we found 2 carbon samples C.3.     ,~: C-3-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,"603,2002-07-07," A-8-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 1   Area A   Trench 8   July 7, 2002      Trench A8 was created in order to speed up the work in the step trench (formerly A2). It consists of a 10x2 meter trench with a number of steps. Work in the first week consisted of cleaning residual topsoil and sub-topsoil deposits, particularly in the bottom and top steps. Initial excavation of topsoil (locus 1) from the bottom step produced some artifacts but work stopped since the goal of cleaning was achieved. Once the work in locus 1 ended, excavation began in earnest in the top step. The top step begins at approximately the 15-meter mark, measuring from the summit of the Tepe. The topsoil of the entire trench was formerly excavated by E. Moseman as locus 2043. Sub-topsoil was excavated as locus 2 since loci number were designated according to new trench nomenclature.       The first step proved to be difficult to read for the sheer abundance of mud brick debris and various lenses of fill of a variety of colors and textures. At this stage it appears that a wall runs out of the northern baulk (effectively the last step of A2) and crosses the section from north to south. This wall (locus 5) is relatively wide and composed entirely of mud brick of both green and red/orange brick. A further mud brick alignment is located parallel and east of locus 5, but it remains partially obscured by other fills and debris. Further excavation will focus on the elaboration of the walls and the association of these walls with potential surfaces, which have yet to come to light.       Whilst the northern part of the step has been excavated practically to the level of the next step, the upper portion requires further excavation of sensitive layers.      Artifacts of particular note consist of one small, flat, rectilinear stone object with a perforation. This was though to be either a loom weight or a pendant. In addition to a number of Khabur pieces, characterized by black horizontal line decoration, two black burnished rim sherds were also recovered. The latter is commonly associated with Anatolian mountain ware. The two pieces _ÑÐ a jar and bowl rim respectively _ÑÐ were recovered from loci 4 and 7.           ,~: A-8-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,"604,2002-07-07," F-7-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7047,","   Weekly Trench    Area F   Trench 7   July 7, 2002      This week we opened this trench for the 2nd season of excavation. There were a lot of loci to open consisting of some pits (7047 and 7049) the wall structure (7053) and interior and exterior fill (7057 and 7056) and the burial and surrounding fill (7054 and 7055). This week we mainly focused on cleaning the baulks and the off season debris.   Two large fill loci were assigned in the trench: 7057, the possible interior of the wall structure and 7056, the exterior of the wall structure. As we cleaned these loci by removing 3-5 cms of dirt, we found a lot of flat lying pottery sherds and animal bones, hopefully indicating some upcoming surfaces. We also found another cobbled surface in the northern part of the trench that is cut by pit 7050.   We excavated the pits this week and found out that they were shallow. Under pit 7050 there are some indications of another surface.   The other major project this week was articulating the 2 surfaces left form last year: 7047 and 7049. 7047 was irregular in shape. After defining its boundaries we collected a 10-liter sample of soil to perform a microanalysis on it. The surface was removed and underneath it there is a pit that will be opened tomorrow. This locus will be closed tomorrow. Surface 7049 is circular in shape and does not extend to the wall 7053. It is a possibility that it is a filled in pit. One characteristic that we have noticed about the surfaces in F7 is that they generally have pits directly beneath them _ÑÐ something to keep in mind.   The last main project was a thorough cleaning of all the baulks in order to have a clear picture of the stratigraphy.   Next week our goals include trying to define the area of the wall structure in the trench and trying to find any associated surface to the wall. We will also try to get the baulks drawn in the trench.     ,~: F-7-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7047,"605,2002-07-07," F-1-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1057,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 1   Area F   Trench 1   July 7, 2002      This week we re-opened the same trench that I worked in last year, F1. Last year this trench had been a very important trench in showing the clear break between the early Bronze Age and the Chalcolithic here at this site. We are hoping for even more exciting events this year to match the Dead Guy with the Juglet in his arm and the Black Ashy Layer of Doom.      We only were here for the last two days this week. We divided the trench into new loci. These new loci are L1057, cobble surface at the bottom of last year_Ñés L1046 pit, 1058 and 1059 area underneath where the oven and oven wall used to be respectively, L1060 a hard baked clay surface upon which the ashy layer (L1037, along with other loci) ended up resting probably, and L1061, area to the E of L1057. Most of the trench appeared to be the same clay baked surface L1060. We theorize that this is the surface upon which the black ashy layer from last year was eventually deposited on. This surface may have even been just outside earth that was baked by the heat of the black ash being deposited on it. This surface was very clean, not many artifacts were on it. Yet, we recognize that there may have been tons of stuff occurring on this surface. For this reason we took tons of samples for soil analysis of the chemical, float, and micro-artifact varieties.       There were not many significant finds during these two days. Two small finds were an obsidian piece that looked like a pretty nice blade (L1060 KT4) and a piece of pottery that looked suspiciously like a kiln stand like thing (1061, KT 7) which is very similar to a small find found in the Chalcolithic oven of F4 last year.      Small weekly summary, but it was only two days. Looking to push down even further now that this surface is being removed in the next week.

This trench is located directly north of trench D4 and west of trench D5. The reason we decided to place a trench in this position is because we could see several surfaces in the baulk of trench D5 and in the baulk of trench D4 (in the old sounding D3). These surfaces are close to ground surface and are almost certainly the same as those already excavated in D4 during the 2001 field season. Thus the goal of this trench is to expose more of the large building already found in D4.    This unit is located on a steep northeast slope. We began by take elevations which show the slope. To illustrate the slope here are the opening elevations for the corners: The highest corner is in the southwest (elevation  590.49). The northwest corner is 589.49. The lowest corner is in the northeast. That elevation is 588.13. Finally the southeast corner is 589.15.    First we took elevations of all the corners then started to dig. Because of the slope we started to excavate by dividing the trench into steps (steps 1, 2 3 and 4). The 1st step was given to Locus 1, located SW corner. The 2nd step is just below the 1st step. It was excavated as locus 2. The topsoil in the 3ird step was given locus 3 and the topsoil in the 4th step was given locus 4. We took the first step down almost to the level of the second step where we reached a different soil that is different in terms of color and composition. We therefore we gave this a new locus number (locus 5, located in the SW corner of the trench). Then we took elevation for the Loc 5 (see locus sheet for elevation).   We did not finish cleaning the 3rd and 4th steps. Therefore, tomorrow we will clean the 3rd and 4th steps by taking out the top soil.   The only notable find for the day was a small piece of shell (D.7.1.4).         ,~: D-7-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 7/Locus 1,"607,2002-07-07," D-4-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4051,","   Area D Trench 4    July 7, 2002      We started to the day by taking our elevations. The datum is placed in the south west corner of the D4 and it is; 592.081. So my thing for today was to take the elevations of L4051 (the rocks that come out of the bottom of the baulk). After that I have taken the rocks of L4051 out and closed the locus. Then we started to cut about 15cm of the pit, as it is being mentioned before (being mentioned yesterday), we wanted to have a visual guide that can help us to prepare ourselves to the stuff that will come out next. So as far as we could see another floor will show up. This means that we have reached out to our aim by cutting the pit. Till breakfast we were able to find four small finds from L4051. Three of them are grinding stones made form basalt and the fourth one is worked stone (might be used by hacking some thing). Their KT numbers are in order; 3, 4, 5 and 6.      We came back to the trench after breakfast, and we were very fast in excavating almost the half of the trench. After taking out L4051, we were able to face a new wall coming up; the locus of this wall is 4062. The part from last year; the sealed floors L4042 L4041, and then the locias from this year L4055, L4056 are now L4061. L4054 will as it is for a few more days, we want to be sure how deep it is going.

After this we kept on going to the north but this time we went part we have found many ceramics and lithics.    Before going to breakfast we have taken the elevations of this part. After the breakfast we have kept on digging from the east side of the oven (locus 2) till to locus 4which is the north baulk. At this part we were able to see some more pieces from the oven being found in area of consisting the length of 1.5m.We were able to see that the oven (locus 6) and the parts being found in locus 5 and locus 6 have the material and context. Locus 6 is a bit mixed up and it has got a few potsherds From locus 6 we have taken out loose pieces of the oven and slag and we have taken a sample of the well preserved part of it.     After we have excavated locus 3,about 7-8 cm down, so it means that it came down to the same level that is next to it (locus 4-locus 6). By digging locus 3 our aim was to see the edge of the oven (locus 2). We wanted to see where it ends, but we were not able to finished it.    Our aim for tomorrow is to excavate locus 2, locus 3 and locus 6 and find out if they have a relation in context. Then we will come down with the south part of the first step to the same level with the second step.      ,~: D-6-2002-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 1,"609,2002-07-08," A-8-2002-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench     Area A   Trench 8   July 8, 2002      Work began with the removal of the western section of the wall stump locus 5. Once and even, straight section was created, and the unexcavated portion in the east was aligned with the western portion, excavation of both portions _ÑÐ loci 11 and 5 _ÑÐ began.       Wall slump locus 5 did not resolved satisfactorily to produce an unequivocal wall line. The south and west sections did not help greatly with this. It is not clear whether the wall lay truly from south to north or if it ran east to west and collapsed to the north down slope.      Locus 8 seems to belong to this wall slump. The base of the wall slump produced a reddish fill similar to locus 11. Artifact remains were very sparse, but an interesting concentration of finely levigated clay was discovered and sampled.      Locus 11 was also sparse in remains, but a row of bricks is evident in the low south section. At the level of the bricks the soil begins to turn into locus 10, as it does in locus 5 lower. The absence of clearly defined bricks in the mud brick section running north to south emphasizes the probability that the entire area can be attributed to the same episode of wall collapse.      Tomorrow work will focus on flattening and reducing the raised southern pedestal/step under loci 5 and 11 to the level of the rest of the rest of the step to the north, reaching locus 10 and a clean context.      ,~: A-8-2002-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,"610,2002-07-08," D-5-2002-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 5   July 8, 2002      Work was slow today as we tried to determine how to deal with the fabric in L5094 and what/if should be micro-sampled (KTs 5094.17-5094.19). As result, time was spent working down the far north of the trench where the contexts are still unclear, partially because of the large ashpit in the deeply buried NW and the shallow distance to the slope in the NE. Though nothing clear emerged, some areas with possible mudbrick architecture came clear, though exactly their nature is unclear at this time.   The only other major event in the trench today was the emergence of an unexpected context. The western portion of the northern wall of the mudbrick structure in the S was being removed (to attempt to verify it in the section) when we came upon what appears to be a large concentration (at places up to near a centimeter thick) of organic material. -Copious photography-    It then occurred to me that the denser segments of the organic material looked exactly like the material of the \plaster\ feature L5095. On re-assesment, that locus is probably the same material.   This leads to two important things. Firstly, it appears to tie the Ubaid (?) pottery surfaces to the mudbrick structure, which would be very nice, but it also leads me to a little theory. That is, I have been trying to explain the huge number of small, medial and serrated obsidian blades I_Ñéve been coming across in the related loci. I believe they are sickle blades. So the theory is that this context was (for whatever reason) some sort of agricultural dump, post-harvest, and occasionally blades, used during the harvest, would get caught in the collecting. Given I haven_Ñét seen any substantial obsidian flakes, I have trouble believing it was a tool making or reworking area. This may change, however, if I reach the actual bottom surface and find a bunch of cores or reduction flakes...     ,~: D-5-2002-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,"611,2002-07-08," A-9-2002-07-08 (2) from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,","   Daily Trench     Area A   Trench 9    July 8, 2002      We dug another 20cm of topsoil in the 8-12m step. We started at the 8-10m mark and will continue down the slope. We also began to cut down the last hardest bit of L3 and found an area of very dark, hard clayey flaky fill in the SW corner. Its possible that this is mudbrick. We shave a few cm off the top where there was a change in soil color from a lighter brown to a darker reddish brown. When you look at the south baulk there seem to be a few dark red bricks (7.5YR 5/4 Brown) in section on top of some grayer ashy fill. There are many ashy parts and we found a large carbon sample L3 KT 15 in the SW corner of the locus. We cut about 10cm out of a softer area of L3 in the North half meter. We changed bags to avoid mixing. We are probably at the beginning of some jumbled structure. In the locus we found some small cobbles and some large potsherds right next to them in the North half of the locus. We will keep this area as L3 because these new bricks and mixed ash and plaster start at the beginning of the locus and they are already mixed.    We will go down another 20cm in topsoil at 8-12m today, hopefully level another step and get past the topsoil in that area. We decided to cut the last bit of L3 in half east to west and dig in the east first. We have been finding lots of heavily fired pottery sherds. The inside of the sherd is burnt so black that it is hard to distinguish it from black ash and the outside is burnished. As we dug down in the east half we found some baked clay bits in the SE corner at the baulk, a little was mixed in the fill. There are also lots of very small ash bits and pebbles in the fill. We found some fill that is very much like the mudbricks we can see in the baulk but it was only fill. Finished digging the east half of the locus and looked at the section. It appears about 10cm down there is a large ashy layer that we can also see in the baulk. We decided to shave 10cm off of L3_Ñés SW corner. The ash appears to span the south baulk and it is not dark grey it is brown grey.

That has the KT number as 6, and its elevation is 590.291. Then we opened two new locias; these are L4063 and L4064. L4063 is the west side of the old pit that was used to be called as L4028 last year. I wanted to get guide for myself by cutting 15cm from the pit (from the east side of it). We are taking soil samples from L4061 to make microanalysis. Also we started to excavate L4060.        The south west corner of L4061 was very soft in texture and its composition was not so mixed, but all the bones from this locus were found in the south west corner, the KT number for them is 8, an the elevation is 590.221. By the way I have not excavated L4064 now, because L4061 and L4063 took us a lot of time to clean and to articulate. The excavating process of L4061was very slow, our direction was from the north to south. This process is being done two times; during our first process we went 5cm deep and then we went 8cm deep, and nothing has changed the texture remained the same. So, we decided to excavate 2cm more in depth. But we began to use the small picks. The whole locus turned out to be L4065. L4061 was a fill, but when we examine the locus we can observe that it is a surface. The most amazing thing here is that there are nicely decorated potsherds that were handled, we can say that this surface is nice example of the 2nd millennium B.C., we have not seen potsherds like these ones before.        Today we were not able to finish the articulating process L4065 (it will be opened tomorrow), because we had to close today, so I have taken some photos of the potsherds (very close zoom ones), and my aim for tomorrow is to articulate L4065 completely and then excavate L4064.         &nbsp;&nbsp;P.S.: I have taken soil samples for micro- analysis .

The fill in this new locus is of the same darker color as above but intermingled with it are small white pebbles Munselling to 2.5 Y 8/1 White. These white pebbles may signal approaching structure as seen in F9 trench to the East, this is one of the questions that we are trying to answer ! does the wall observed in the Southwest corner of F9 continue west from there or does it go South from there.   I am also having one of the workers articulate the stones nearer to the North side of the trench before deciding if it is anything of consequence or just a random collection of stones. This point is made because unlike other stone conglomerations, this one does not have any specific shape or form or pattern, but is rather loose and un-organized. This collection of cobbles was measured and photographed. Remarkably all of the excavated areas of the trench are still yielding little pottery.   Today we also worked on clearing F9 a little more, this will help us understand not only F13 but also other nearby trenches. We also laid several new trenches in the area.

Or at least trying to figure them out. The baulks had eroded badly, so cleaning them was more difficult then expected. As generally happens in such conditions, a great find fell out of my baulk on the first day during cleaning so the context was lost, but a very nice cylinder seal (KT1067.7) was found.      It took a couple of days to start deciphering what was going on in the trench as it was left after last season. For one thing, the entire eastern baulk was found to contain a large stone wall L1069. Articulating this wall and preparing it for spider shots also took a day or two.      The southern section of the wall 1069 is substantially higher (about 50cm) than the northern half which seems to have been removed down to the last course (or only ever consisted of one course). During the articulating process a large piece of green slag was found on the flat surface of pot shards between the two large white stones. This section of wall also appears to have five courses.      Interestingly enough, it appears that there my be a parallel wall to 1069. L1071 was marked as an artifact scatter last season but is contained in a very regular rectangular surface. This surface runs parallel to 1069 as well as corresponding to a large grouping of stone sin the north baulk that seem to be of a similar construction to the five courses of 1069.      The rest of the week was taken up by L1070 which was the cleaning locus for the entire bottom of the trench. A good deal of pottery, etc. is coming up but as of yet I am sill working on figuring out what should be a  atural\ locus and what is residual digging from the last season that might be played out.     ,~: C-1-2002-07-08-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1,"615,2002-07-08," D-6-2002-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 1,","   Area D Trench 6 July 8, 2002       Today we started to excavate from locus 3, our aim was to find the oven is ending point; locus 2, also we wanted to find the surface of it.

After this we have articulated locus 6 and we have seen that the oven pieces are collapse pieces, so we think that the pieces in locus 5 might be collapsed too.    After this we have equalized the upper step, by doing this we wanted to see edge of the oven; this took place in 13 in 13 and 6.From locus 3 we found a small metal sample while we were digging locus 3 we found a low of rocks in north south direction (starts from the side of the baulk). These are regular stones and they are placed at the west side of the oven (locus 2), so we think that is a wall. Tomorrow we will give a new locus number to it. Also we have taken 10 lt.

My early theory is that anyone moving or re-depositing virgin soil from one area to another must have had a good reason for doing just that. One would wonder rather safely that there is a purpose contained in the use of this soil. If the white speckled soil is virgin soil, why was it moved, or what was it used for? One guess that arises as part of its composition is that the white chalky pebbles contained as part of it may be components in brick making or brick laying! perhaps it was used in plastering or coloring of the bricks.   With this idea in mind I would like to follow the areas that exhibit the white pebbles along and see if it in fact may signal the walls we are looking for.

While clearing a trench around the plaster (so that a metal sheet could be placed under the whole of it) it was discovered the feature when further than originally expected, though not substantially. In the interest of getting the material out of the trench (it had been exposed for three days), the largest segment was removed during the afternoon.   The removal went reasonably well considering the lack of stabilization. Though there was some fracturing, the essential piece where the fabric can be seen laying over a mudbrick or something similar survived in tact. I would have hoped for better results, but frankly they were better than I expected.   Other time during the day was spent bringing the NE corner down to the general level of excavations (L5084). The area still seems to be pretty much loose fill, possibly still tumble, though in the more westward portions we are perhaps coming down on some mudbrick collapse or the very start of some architecture.     ,~: D-5-2002-07-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,"626,2002-07-09," D-4-2002-07-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4061,","   Area D Trench 4   July 9, 2002      We started to the day by articulating the surface L4065.While the articulating process kept on going we were also able to excavate the north west side of the trench; L4064 which had been opened yesterday. The color of this locus is 7YR 5/4 reddish brown. I thought that we might be able to pick up a great bunch of ceramics but it did not worked out like that. But, we were able to find a nail, it was located next to north baulk, at the north east corner of the locus; 4064.The KT # for this nail is 5, and its elevation was 590.341.      After breakfast we have articulated L4065 and then swept it. Also we have excavated L4064 for a second 10cm down. As mentioned before the surface_Ñés ceramic pieces show us that we are in the 2nd millennium B.C. So, I want to know if the surface goes beneath the gaint rocks of L4037 (the locus number from last year). In a very close time I will be at the same level with D3, but waiting for a while might be much better, because we are able to observe the coming surfaces.      For this reason my aim for tomorrow is to excavate L4064 at least for 10cm more.

This trench was originally measured as a ten by ten meters (10 x 10 m) by for now we will open up a one by nine meter (1 x 9 m) stretch of it on its most western meter.   Depending on daily worker availability we may work on this trench sporadically. Our intentions at this point are to determine on a wide area the existence or rather the former occupational characteristics of the lower town at Kenan Tepe and how we may tie those new discoveries unto existence levels already uncovered in area F. Obviously as the excavation may uncover signs of architecture the trench may then be expanded to the East. Our initial concern calls for the quick removal of the overburden layers, this means that the top 0.40 to 0.50 meters will be displaced quickly. In the initial hour we removed 0.23 meter.

Exploration, and discussion: Oven locus 2 has become Furnace locus 2, and must be treats with great care. First, we changed our tents for white ones. So any blue material would not be hidden from sight. We then cut a 20cm `section locus` locus 7, one meter south at locus 2, running, E-W to check for any surfaces or ancient slopes. This revealed a possible surface and exposed 3 courses of the rock line locus 10, leading from the baulk at locus 2 into the west baulk. This leads us the believe locus 2 continues down to the elevation of our 2nd step. We also cleaned and did some exploratory excavation in the south chamber of Furnace locus 2, and noticed red soil coming up about 5 cm below our current surface, possibly evidence of the `fire box`. We also found slag coating the inside of the small wall at the furnace continues in a thick drip formation into the red soil, and found more slag in the south central chamber.      ,~: D-6-2002-07-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 1,"630,2002-07-09," C-3-2002-07-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,","   C 3 Daily , July 09, 2002      Today we cleaned and articulated the N-S running wall L3068 In the SE portion of the trench.

This is L3074. Also we found the foundation trench on the E side of the wall L3068 and saw that it is cutting through 3060 and L3063.

Quickly we found another large \surface\ of the compacted organic material, this one at least as extensive as the other (L5095) but at the moment its full extent is unclear as we need to dig deeper in surrounding areas before can fully articulate it. Many samples were taken.   While going down to the N of this feature, the rock group seems to be expanding, but no architecture is apparent right now. Nonetheless, the area has been redesignated L5099. Of interest, this portion of the locus produced a conical loom weight (or bead), KT 5094.49; several obsidian blade portions (KTs 5094.53, 5094.54, 5094.49 and 5094.46); and possibly a couple large hammerstones (KTs 5094.51 and 5094.2).   My current theory of the feature-rich parts of the trench is that we have a corner of the mudbrick structure and the far SW corner is the only enclosed area, the SE being an attached but exterior cooking space and the organic-laden center-W is an outdoor storage area, possibly with only three original walls which were partially timber, hence our difficulty in tracing them. What_Ñés going on in the N, NE, and E-central is still somewhat unclear, though I think the NE may still be effected by tumble, though perhaps ancient as opposed to more recent tumble.   The main plan for tomorrow is to bring down the whole central portion of the trench, as best we can, to the lowest floor level (currently the southern grain), assuming we don_Ñét encounter any notable features on the way down.

We decided to divide the furnace into 9 loci. We then drew a detailed dayplan of the furnace and surroundings, including the rock line L10.       We excavated Locus 4 2cm at a time with the belief that we might discover a surface associated with the furnace L2/L20. We found the beginnings of a surface, but then felt overwhelmed and sent our workers away. Then we excavated L13, a 50 x 15 cm mixed section locus to determine the context and stratigraphy to the East of the oven.

Immediately below locus 13 a further white organic surface became visible and this was named locus 14. After peeling off the latter locus, which was confined to the length of wall 15 along its eastern flank only, we hit a hard reddish fill, named locus 16. This locus is located 10cm below locus 14 in order to capture the locus matrix of the white surface. Locus 16 underlies sub-topsoil locus 2 in the north because the spill line descends to the northern edge of the next step with which we are now level.      Locus 16 produced a very good sample of artifacts including one obsidian blade and a red horizontal band-painted jug probably belonging to the Habur variety.

This  will talk about two more fun and delightful areas of focus in our trench. Today we started from the area known as Locus 1067 in our trench and began to push down towards the west and towards the north baulks. The area we began to excavate towards the North baulk we gave the locus of 1072. This locus was going pretty good, but as we were excavating we noticed that we were beginning to hit into a redder area than the rest of the fill of this locus. A thorough cleaning showed that we were hitting upon a wall. This wall is actually a bit higher in the trench than the other wall 1069 we had hit upon. This new wall we named 1073.      On the other side of the trench we had named the entire far western meter and a half of the trench locus 1071. This locus was not taken off all at one time, but the fill that we were going through all appeared to be of the same consistency, brown dirt, which was not too soft or too hard, indicating the absence of pits and walls and the existence of a general fill. This area we took down in increments of five centimeters, starting at the south baulk and working our way towards the North baulk. Over near the north baulk, .9 meters from the west baulk and .9 meters from the north baulk we ran into a very interesting piece of pottery. This appeared to be a nearly complete potsmash, which was laying on a surface in the trench. We spent the day attempting to take the entire locus down to the lower level of the potsmash, but ran out of time after some great hard work. We did not remove the potsmash today, but will remove that on the 13th when we get back from Diyarbakir. Also in the locus were some good pottery diagnostic sherds.

NOTE: pieces of the same yellow-green fine-ware bowl are present in locus 16 as they were in 10, 11 and 13.      Note on locus 5: The bricks visible in the southern section belonging to wall locus 5 are separated by a darker channel locus 8. These are either wall debris or a separate wall on the east side of the trench. The first organic white surface locus 12 lies beneath both concentrations of debris. The distinct concentrations of wall debris were missed in the excavation of locus 11. This scenario however, is not seen with the white surface of locus 14, which meets the top of wall debris locus 15. Possibly this debris represents the same, earlier wall, pitted during a later period and represented by the dark channel in the center of the trench.      The wall 15 is difficult to read after all because it appears to extend further down. A possible soil change was noted to the east of the wall line at the border of the wall and locus 16. This may suggest that there is a solid concentration of mud brick on the western half of the trench.       A further wall, locus 18, running east to west was picked up on the northern extreme of wall 15, but probably belongs to an earlier phase and does not form a corner. The earth north of this wall is noticeably darker and looser and has been named locus 17. Within locus 17 a dark pit was identified and named locus 19.

To the west the area is cut off by the 10-15cm drop left from the 2001 excavation.      Locus 1070, the cleaning locus, continues to the western section of the trench. New KTs were started to facilitate this new section.      Locus 1072 is a section of the southern baulk adjacent to the wall (L1069) that contains a good amount of stone and broken pottery. This could have been a continuance of the wall to the south or some other sort of architectural surface. At the base of this locus a triangular fish weight was found. Also the baulk shows a yellowish arcing line that might have marked some sort of pit that was missed during excavation in the 2001 season.      Locus 1069, the wall encompassing most of the eastern baulk, was cleaned today. The central section between the two main jagged cobbles contains a great deal of flat lying pottery, possibly marking some sort of entrance to a structure or at least a passageway. The center of this area contained a large piece of greenish slag (KT 1069.10). This is unusual since no other slag has been found in the wall to this point. This area also contained an area of pebble concentration with many red river pebbles that were also saved since they were not found at other parts of the wall. A floatation sample was taken from the northern section of the wall.     ,~: C-1-2002-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1068,"646,2002-07-11," C-3-2002-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,","   C 3 Daily s, July 11, 2002      Today we started by digging the surface, L3074, associated with the wall L3068, in the S part of the wall coming out of the baulk, because it came later than the wall and we want to remove the wall. Under was something a little different that the fill that seems to be coming up with the wall, so I am designating it L3075. After taking some pictures and after we took a spider photograph (note to Drew: use the day plan from the day before for the photo because that is the one that in carefully re-measured in) we began to remove the stones of the wall course by course in order to preserve any connection we can get with the northern section of the wall. We found that the stones do go down quite a way and that with the top layers removed it looks even more connected with the northern half. While digging we found two grind stones, C.3.3068.4 and C.3.3068.6, in the wall. But the most interesting find was at the southern most edge of the wall next to the surface, L3074, on the Eastern portion of that part of the wall. It seems to be a partly broken doorpost, C.3.3068.4. Unfortunately I was not ably to get a picture of it in situ as one of my workers handed it to me, but I was able to measure the spot he found it at in my dayplan. We finished up the day having definitely removed the first course of stones and possibly part of the second course. As I look at the trench at the end f the day the association of the portion of the wall in the south and the portion of the wall in the north is clearer and the robbed out areas are a bit more apparent as a robbed out area. Also the part of the wall that seemed to curve NW looks more and more like collapse or something, not a second wall or a split of the one wall. The reason I say this is that the rocks from the south do not look to continue in a NW fashion after the first course was removed, and also there are not more courses underneath it while there are more courses under the remainder of the wall.     ,~: C-3-2002-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,"647,2002-07-11," F-13-2002-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 13/Locus 7,","   Daily Trench    Area F   Trench 13   July 11, 2002      Our efforts today will continue to include working on the \wall\ part of Locus 9 as we seek to consolidate our understanding by defining it better. Being that the space is so narrow I have decided to expand our excavated areas 2 meters deep, that is, towards the West. From the South baulk we went 2 meters North and again 2 meters past that point. Also from the existing artificial West baulk we went 1.50 meters West. The idea is to have additional working space to facilitate the work and make easier the work of defining the architecture which we believe we have.   I will maintain locus # 1 for at least the top soil abd top overburden layers but will likely change rather than reference earlier loci numbers.    The bit of ash we saw on the West baulk turned out to be a very shallow pit. I believe this pit was cut through the top layers to bury a small ceramic oven which was used for cooking. We recovered very little of the oven itself. The contents of its pit were screened and separated as locus 11. After reaching the bottom of this cooking pit I changed the locus number to # 12, and collected it separately. We had an ambitious goal to lower this area to the level of locus 9 but were unable to finish it today. Due to the fast excavating it may be observed that layers and materials which were better separated in the 1 by 9 meter original trench could be found mixed in this part of the excavation. It may also be noted that there was very little pottery appearing in this area.      ,~: F-13-2002-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 13/Locus 7,"648,2002-07-11," D-5-2002-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 5   July 11, 2002      Work focused on getting the central region of the trench lowered, in particular the area E of L5094/L5100.

However, either L5102 being or L5059_Ñés continuation or simply L5059_Ñés existence (which I had briefly forgotten until I took another look at my top plans from last season) could explain the mixed pottery and other materials towards the eastern baulk of the trench.

At this time its potential associations are totally unclear as we_Ñéve only begun to uncover and until we_Ñére a bit further they will remain so.

During the removing the of dirt (about 10 cm ),I saw a layer which was hard soil.Because of that I took a soil sample(C.4.4087.+8) and I went on to excavate(Locus 4087) ,because the pit structure was not different. In this area I took 4 carbon samples (C.4.4087.4+5+7+10+11). Also from the first layer I took a pieces of oven fragment (C.4.4087+6) and one shell (C.4.4087.9) and two plaster samples (C.4.4087.5+4). When the pit cleaned I took a photo of this pit.   I gave a new locus number to an area, which was on the south of the L4072. I thought this was an oven . This new locus was called as L4089.

After a while we have taken L4068 out and closed the locus (the closing elevations are missing right now, they will be taken on the 13th of July, so nothing will be done on this area till the elevations will be taken).      After all we began to articulate L4066 and L4070. As far as I can see the surface L4065 touches the rocks of L4066. But, the rocks of L4070 seem to be separate from this part, even though the rocks at the east side of this locus seem to be in the air. Some of the rocks seem to be come out by indential movement (the east part of the locus). During this process I began to excavate L4067, and we started from the south of the locus and went to the north. We have excavated it two times for 3cm in depth, this means that we have excavated the locus for 6cm deep. We have found tiny ceramic pieces, and nothing more.

We were able to see that the trench has remained as the same that we have closed up last year, August 13, 2001. To make this clear we have taken some photos from each part of the trench. Then we decided to take the baulk in between D4 and D3 down. This means that D3 will be adjoined to D4. So, the locus number of the baulk was 4046, and it was \L\ shaped (this is the locus of the top soil).      For a few days we had some problems with the datum point. On the 4th of July we were able to get our datum point to fixed, it is located at southeast corner of D4, and it is 592.081. The only locus that remains from last year at the end of the first week was the big rocks, but their locus number have changed and now it is L4070, and I have to say that they are touching the floor of locus 4065. As a difference from last year, I was able to get two very good carbon samples. On the 8th of July I have taken two soil samples from L4061 for microanalysis. The first 10lt. was from the southwest corner of the locus, because the whole bones were found there, and the second 10lt. have been taken from the whole locus (4061).      Finding good carbon samples reminds me of the new trenchD6, that is located at the south of D4, because D6 was able to find a furnace at the same level with D4, last year I was able to find the collapse mud-brick at the same level with some slags laying in between the mud-bricks.

This procedure went smoothly, though time consuming. The first two points taken were the northwest and northeast corners of the trench. The cleaning locus 1070 brought us below the extent of the wall. In order to establish the lower layers the wall will be removed tomorrow beginning with the highest of the five courses.      Locus 1073 was created as a mirror of 1072, in order to remove the stones and pottery protruding from the northern baulk to the west of the wall. Upon further investigation of this locus and locus 1071, it is hypothesized that perhaps they together make up the remnants of a wall that was inadvertently removed in 2001. Locus 1073 contained cobbles, broken pottery and pebble layers similar to the construction of the 5 courses visible in locus 1069.      Locus 1071 initially looked like some sort of artifact scatter or fill because of its high concentration of broken pottery found at all angles (therefore not suggesting a surface). When looked at closer and initially delineated, this locus lines up with locus 1073 and runs parallel to locus 1069. A cut line is visible on the eastern side, but the western side was dug through in 2001 and is approximately 10-15cm lower than the rest of the locus.      Locus 1070 is finally close to completion. There is only a small area by the unexcavated stair in the northwest corner that remains to be done.

Like yesterday we concentrated mostly on the southern section of the wall. Looking at the elevations and the qualitative relationship of the north and the south portions of the wall we can see that they are relatively at the same level depending on which stones you measure from. The sections are about 5-10cm off from one another at the highest point of derivation. The wall so far has three courses in the southern half and there might be a fourth. Some of the pottery that is coming up is second millennium but the surface that was associated with the wall was Early Iron, so this locus must be looked at closely during pottery reading. After we got through the stones we hit some incredibly loose dirt which seems to be the foundation trench of the wall which is now designated L3076. Under the surface that was the threshold of the wall in the southernmost part of the wall there was some of the same looking fill that comprised L3076, but after that there is some harder ashier soil directly underneath that, so it is L3075. Also, while digging out L3068 we found 3 grinding stones, C.3.3068.12-14. C.3.3068,12 has some interesting stuff on one side so Me and Lynn should take a look at it. We also found a very nice, large carbon sample, C.3.3068.10 that came from partway inside the wall amongst the rocks. If interested this piece of carbon could date the wall. Also in the north half of the trench we have been digging and should get rid of it as soon as possible before going on as it is later than the wall. In the north part of the wall we found several pieces of broken oven. At the end of the day in the Northern section of the wall where some stones were had been removed, there was found some plastery pieces (look into tomorrows  for a better explination) that were similar to what had been found in C2 earlier.

(This is quadrant G3 plus about 20 additional cms from G2 so we could catch everything in the corner). Cengis worked in this area and found oven bricks. One possible explanation for a 3-sided structure with an oven in the corner is possible butcher shop/wind shelter for the oven.   We then continued on the western exterior surface of the structure by taking down the elevation by a few cms. We continued to sample 10% of the area and screened the loci against the structure.

Of note, a loom weight (KT 5098.14) was recovered from the material, and several good samples were taken (KTs 5098.17, 5098.18 and 5098.19).

The plan is to start today by pressing down 0.10 to 0.15 meters and reevaluate what our progress is up to now. After this I will change the locus #.   We have had workers coming and going today so it has been difficult to keep a trained person working on the trench. I am having to divide workers amongst 3 trenches in order to have the better couple of workers I have to do the more delicate work.   In F15 we decided to go down another 0.10 to 0.15 meters. We found that the soil is still fairly soft and easy for picking with either the large or the small hand picks. On the Northernmost meter of the trench we began uncovering some large cobblestones (approximately 0.10 to 0.20 meters in length), it appears that we have about 7 of these at about the same height but are not found in any specific order or arrangement. These layout and size of these stones reminds me somewhat of the stones found in F14 not far to the Northeast, we believe that one to be a burial. We may have to dig a bit North and East of the stones before we can ascertain its true dimensions and purpose.

Some of the problems amounted to errors of up 45-50cm. It was decided to re-measure the entire trench. This work was only to take the morning.   While measuring we continued work on L2122, where we continued to scrape off the dirt on the top of the mudbrick.    After a while a pattern of lines radiating from the two pits excavated on the 10th, L2123 and L2124, creating a number of trapeze shaped bricks around the two pits. This gave two circular patterns visible from above. Were these pits cut through L2122, or was the mudbrick created so that there might be two circular pits?   This scraping produced a number of potsherds, labeled KT 17, some bone labeled KT 18 and lithics KT 19. A piece of shell was found as well and labeled KT 20. A single carbon sample was taken and measured in on the plan. It was labeled KT 21.    The measuring job on the other hand did not progress as expected, because of many things, but mainly because that I had not recuperated completely.

It is adjacent to the 1 meter probe I have been digging. Measuring from the south baulk I went north two meters, then staked a point and went west 2 meters from there and then went north another two meters. This was done so I can follow the rock formation, L3, west and uncover the whole thing. This new area is not quite in the center of the trench, but is located closer to the southern end. I made the opening locus of the new area L1, because it is topsoil and equivalent to the topsoil we dug before. Andy and I felt that naming it L1 would cause less confusion in the locus situation. This way all the same topsoil is L1 instead of having topsoil loci pop up later as something odd like L7.    I took off about 20 cm of the topsoil and did indeed then come upon more rocks. I did not do much articulation of the stones as it was at the end of the day. Since the stones are extending further west, but not all the way to the western edge of the new section we cut, I feel more confident that there is a burial underneath all the stones.     ,~: F-14-2002-07-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 14/Locus 1,"665,2002-07-13," A-2-2002-07-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2112,","   Daily Trench     Area A   Trench 2   July 13, 2002      This year the step trench (formerly Trench A-2) is subdivided into 3 sections with a sounding at the base of the tepe; the top section from the 5m peg to the 15m peg, retains the name A-2, while the section from 15m to 25m is renamed A8 (Ilya) and the section from 25m to 32 m is renamed A9 (Michaelle).

This small remnant of last year_Ñés excavations was hard and crumbly, possibly from the winter_Ñés ing, and also possibly because it is composed of mudbrick material that may be either collapse, or a wall itself.

The locus is now all of the ashy fill south of the wall. We sprayed everything and took pictures, nothing new was immediately apparent. We will continue to cut the ashy layer to east about 10cm at a time looking for a surface associated with the wall and the bottom of the wall itself. We have begun to screen all of the fill from this locus and the artifacts are put into their own KT bags. We have 3 small finds today, KT 23 a small clay figurine, KT 25 a clay disk found while screening and KT 31 is an unusual piece of pottery that was probably part of a figurine.    We stopped at an area about 2/3 of the way to the East baulk. In section at the south baulk we can see that there are some lines of very thin pale mudbrick or slump and they run at a 45 degree angle. There are also some spots of mint sea green clayey plaster like bits of a rock. We will try to get a good sample of this material. The soil becomes harder and less ashy as we move further east more and more clumps of brick and clay can be seen but the material still appears to be the same as it was against the west baulk so we will continue with L6. I will push towards the East baulk and then begin to define the adjacent wall.    In L5 I scraped off the top of the jutting NE part of the locus to make the mudbrick lines easier to see. We also cut down a smaller pedestalled section of hard bricky material between L5 and L6 adjacent to this area and extended to the beginning of the bricks at the NW baulk.    At the end of the day I opened L7 at the end of the day. This is locus for the mudbrick wall not that we know approximately where it is and its relationship to the ashy fill in L6.

The latter has focused almost entirely on getting the entire trench down to the apparent surface level of the southern mudbrick structure. This was necessary as, due to its uncovering late last season, the rest of the trench had not been equally excavated due to time constraints.   Once work commenced we were instantly beset by good and interesting contexts. This first occurred in the central portion of the trench against the W baulk with L5079 which contained many excellent diagnostic pot sherds which, upon preliminary investigation, indicate an Ubaid context. Originally this locus was thought to be a surface but as work continued my opinion has change to that it was part of a jumbled collapse of material from shelves on a wall or something similar. This would help explain the presence of many flat-lying sherds but none of them ever being on quite the same plane. Though natural shifting of material could also explain this there are a couple reasons I do not believe such to be the case.   The first is the extraordinary find of a decomposed (but extant) piece of fabric in the same context, which looks to have been wrapped around or perhaps caught between mubricks. Some good samples of it exist as KT 5094.8, 5094.23, 5094.24, 5094.25, 5064.31, 5094.35, 5094.39 and 5094.40. Further, this is all lying above a crushed, decomposed grain surface (L5098) which, in L5103, is clearly shown to be associated with some of the highly diagnostic black-on-white painted pottery (and in turn with the mudbrick structure which the grain material looks to be stacked up against). There is another concentration of the grain at a higher level, L5095, which also seems associated. Notably, all these above-grain contexts have been turning out huge numbers of obsidian sickle blades which leads me to believe this was some sort of grain depot or semi-enclosed storage structure attached to the N end of the mudbrick structure proper.   Other notable finds include a loom weight, KT 5098.14, a spindle whorl, KT 5511, a mostly in tact small animal (probably rodent) skeleton, KTs 5522 and 5531 and a second spindle whorl, KT 5094.47.   In the northern and eastern parts of the trench things still remain unclear despite extensive excavation. Several pits (L5102, L5081, L5082, L5083 and L5059) serve to confuse and mix the material and it is also entirely possible that in the far NE we are still dealing with surface tumble. This is a shame because some excellent pot sherds, bases and stands were recovered from L5084.        ,~: D-5-2002-07-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"674,2002-07-14," A-8-2002-07-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench     Area A   Trench 8   July 14, 2002      Work concentrated on leveling locus 17 and extending it northwards to incorporate the next step, which was almost level with locus 17. There were no significant soil changes other than in the northeast corner, which produced a brownish fill, cleaner than 17. The hump of debris, northwest of pit 19, was taken down as locus 22, yielding a slag, pottery and bone. Locus 2, defined as sub-topsoil, was excavated north of locus 17 to remove contaminated material near the spill line at the edge of the step. Substantial pottery (2 bags) and bone were recovered, and an installation bounded by mud brick was uncovered at the level of locus 17. The latter was leveled and work commenced in locus 21.      The white organic patch, locus 21, expanded into an extensive rectilinear surface with some flat-lying sherds and reed impressions. Blocks of overlying fill were sampled and a few sherds were collected.

This trench is near the F Datum at an elevation of 570.82 meters. Our reasoning for opening this trench is part of a scheme to cover a lot of ground in the lower town at Kenan Tepe while still getting a pretty fair sampling of close up areas. The question as we look for architecture and features is more related to direction and spread of the town, and the various work areas that would have formed part of it as well as their functionality and the role they may have played as part of the Kenan Tepe community. Thus F15 will work the area almost 20 meters from the current trench opened as part of F13, the trench runs North to South and our hope is to locate more signs of habitation in this direction.    We started quickly not collecting any pottery over the first 0.40 to 0.50 meters, after this we started collecting materials as locus 1 shortly after we began uncovering some large cobblestones (0.10 to 0.20 meters) on the North corner, as they were articulated they displayed rocks at at least 3 different depths and seemingly organized or laid in a specific square pattern. This became locus # 2, since it is right next to what would be the Northeast corner of the North end of trench we will leave it for now and get back to it at a later date. I think that it looks a lot like a burial even at this earlier juncture. It sure reminds me of the collection of rocks (also likely a burial) found in F14.    The digging with either hand pick or large picks has been fairly easy as the ground is not overly packed or rocky. We changed locus number when the soil coloration also changed and became lighter. We have not encountered much in the way of white pebble speckling at the depths to which we have gone. In this new locus we located a pit Locus 4 which is a pit of large dimensions, it was emptied and samples collected as customary.     ,~: F-15-2002-07-14-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 15,"676,2002-07-14," A-10-2002-07-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 10,","   Weekly SummaryArea A   Trench 10      The week started with the completion of L9. It was the 1x2 area in the Western half of the trench. Then, we moved east, excavating L10 (the 1x2 area in the Eastern half of the trench). We continued exposing the mudbrick stove, which I named L8 and L13. L8 comprises the top portions of the stove. I thought that it had ended because the mud brick looked like it had petered out, but when I excavated down a bit more I found that it kept going. Within L13 there is a very fine, loose, silty soil that is exactly like that found in L5 (the pit inside L8). However, there is only a small trace of it left in the trench (though it shows up great in the baulk) and I didn_Ñét realize that it was present until we had already cut into it. I, therefore, combined the silty soil matrix with the mudbrick in locus 13.       Locus 11 is a sandy, rocky matrix in the western half of the trench. It seems to be very similar to the natural, sterile, virgin, river-deposit layers that were found at the bottom of all the G soundings.      Locus 12 was a 1x2 area in the southern half of the trench. L11 cuts underneath it a bit on the western half. It also cuts beneath L14 (the 1x2meters in the northern half of the trench).       I kept digging in the southern half of the trench. Once L15 was excavated, Andy thought it a good idea to save time and just excavate a 1x2 meter portion of the trench. We deduced that the southern half would be a good spot to do the sounding because it has the main baulk, and it cuts through both L11 and L13 (by far the two most interesting loci in the trench right now). L16 had quite a few artifacts, but towards the bottom we started finding more of that same sandy, rocky matrix. I named this locus 17.       Thus far, I_Ñéve dug 50 cm. down in L17 and I haven_Ñét managed to find any artifacts. Due to the soundings location at the bottom of the Tepe, we thought that this stratum may have been formed from natural erosion. However, it seems unlikely that an erosion layer would not have at least a small amount of mixing with cultural layers (especially since there are at least 15 meters of mudbrick, pottery, and bone lying just uphill!). Though, it is a bit shocking because the Area G soundings hit the same sterile layers quite a bit deeper than what we are finding in A.      ,~: A-10-2002-07-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 10,"677,2002-07-14," C-4-2002-07-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 4/Locus 4073,","   7/14/2002   After the daily clearing in the trench, we started to dig in the west of the pit L4075. While removing the first layer, the workers made the west line wider by about 15 cm. When we were digging the 2nd layer, we kept the original boundaries.   After the workers dug the animal burrows, I took a photo of the pit (L4075). Then they dug the hard soil of the pit. The west part of the pit was the same level with the east part, but we didn_Ñét find anything from this first layer.

Also, I took one soil sample because I saw some carbonized seeds in the soil. And I stopped digging in this area for today.   In the meantime, one worker was going on to excavate the west of L4089, which was not completed yesterday. Again, I opened two different bags for the same locus, soft soil and hard soil.

We will start by leveling the trench which appears much deeper on the South end than in the North. As we were doing this we discovered a pit near the middle point of the trench and had to dig this separately, as went down on the pit we realized that only a portion of what appears to be a large pit is located inside the trench. The contents of the pit will be collected partly for flotation analysis and sifting of the remainder. The pit doesn_Ñét contain much in the way of ash or burned deposits; it also looks like there may be few bones in it. It apparent use at this time would point more towards it having been used as a storage rather than as a cooking pit.    In addition to the pit we continue to lower the trench some more. The cobblestones on the North end have been cleaned and articulated as best we can within the confines of the present opened areas. I am wondering whether these stones, the stones in F14 and maybe other stones in F7 may be placed in some sort of lined arrangement which continues through all three trenches, but at this point it is hard to tell. Also when I inquire of Kathy she told me that she did not have that same type of formation in her trench. Anyhow, as locus # 2 is now better defined I will change its locus dimensions to reflect exact measurements and not an arbitrary one by one meter as before. Since no material have been collected as locus # 2 this will not affect already collected bags.        ,~: F-15-2002-07-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 15/Locus 2,"681,2002-07-14," D-6-2002-07-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6,","   Trench D6 Weekly Summary July 14,2002         It_Ñés a bit more than a week, but here it is. Trench D6 was begun on July 3 directly to the South of trench D4. It was begun to discover more about the surfaces found in the 2001 season in D4. It is on the steep East slope of the Tepe, and we began excavation by creating a step following the curve of the tepe. We quickly created another step and have excavated and articulated within the Northwest _ of our 4.5 x 9 meters. To sum it up: It_Ñés all about the furnace (L2/L20) which we found on our first day (July3) and originally believed was a small circular oven. We worked around, within it and upon it, and it_Ñés gotten more complicated and interesting, culminating (so far) in a large (1 x 1.4 m) 5 chambered furnace with copius amounts of slag on it_Ñés South interior wall.       This furnace is a first for this region so we have been very careful in excavation, and have taken many samples and divided it into many loci. The current theory is that it was used for copper smelting/working. Of 5 chambers the outermost and central are smaller than the other two (by about 5 cm). We are currently looking for air openings and an outlet for the slag.      We are still in the process of excavating furnace L2/L20 but have found many associated and possibly associated features, including two lines of rocks (L10-to the South and L16- to the North), mud brick debri L6 _ÑÐ to the Northeast, and mud bricks and plaster-to the West. Possibly associated are L5 (mudbricks and slag, on the 2nd step) , surface L17- to the South, and the small mud brick mound L14. The surface L17 is very interesting in that it consists of a very typical Kenan Tepe rock association including basalt, large pottery sherds, and a hard conglomerate mound, and links between it and the furnace L2/L20 would be strong evidence for its use in smelting.     ,~: D-6-2002-07-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6,"682,2002-07-14," C-3-2002-07-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,","   C3 Daily , July 14, 2002      Today we started by taking off the rest of L3058 which is the locus of fill above the N part of wall L3068. This should have been taken out earlier because it comes later than the wall. With this gone we notice two things, first, the stones that connect the middle northern part of the wall with the part that comes out of the baulk are completely missing. The second is that we have found the continuation of the foundation trench L3076, which is seen under the wall L3068 in the south part of the trench. I believe this is connected to the foundation L3076 because the soil has the same color, 10 YR 4/3, and the same texture and composition, loose, loamy dirt. Also in the fill above wall L3068, L3058, there a few a few spots where there were remnants of deteriorated mud brick. Looking at the soil between the wall and trench we see the are contains many broken oven pieces where rocks of wall L3068 should be. We think that there must be a pit here and can see it in the east baulk as being a lower section of what we excavated last year as L, a large square oven complex that was founded on the wall. The pit has been assigned L3077. Some of the soil in the pit is burned and little red and friable which furthers the connection between the pit and the oven L3030.      ,~: C-3-2002-07-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,"683,2002-07-14," F-13-2002-07-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 13/Locus 7,","   Daily Trench    Area F   Trench 13   July 14, 2002      Today we are emptying the pit locus 14 and its contents are being entirely sifted after the 4 liter soil samples were taken.

As we made these cuts what looks like mortar lines began to show on the East baulk, this runs for about 0.40 meters but there is no visible bricks above it, something that doesn_Ñét make sense.   We also worked on removing the ashy deposit locus 8 and sifted its contents after collecting the necessary soil samples.

The south part of L1 (which was dug Jul 13,2002) took new locus name L5 (2x1m) because this area has soft soil as different than the other part of L1.

We were not sure but at the south side we found a surface that might be mud- brick. The color has changed a lot; it was recognizable (2,5 YR- 6/3 light yellowish brown). We were able to find two slag from here also we have taken soil samples from two different parts of the locus (KT 13-16).       We had noticed that L14 appeared to have structure (especially in its West wall), and articulated it with this in mind. As we removed the upper collapse debri we came upon slag coating an interior chamber in a similar way to that in chamber 24 in L20.       Next we came down about 5 cm in L6 and L11 in order to learn more about wall L16 but did not get far enough down to be able to see any additional courses. In L6 we found what appeared to be a small metal flake (KT 21), and we took soil samples from both L6 and L11.      Next we pushed L8 down 20 cm, the only find of exception was a stone with some metal flecks (KT 11) and a lone mud brick to the North next to an ashy area (pit L18). Examination of the baulk revealed a possible brick line extending from our loner, but nothing for certain. We will learn more after removal of the furnace, as it is very awkward now.       We then cut another section from L23 to check the foundation of the furnace, and discovered the continuation of surface L17 up to the South wall of L20.

So, it was very dirty.   After the sweeping, I took a few photos as opening photos. Then we started to dig with L4074, which was a fill between L4071 and the east baulk of the trench. We removed about 10 cm of dirt. During the excavation, we noticed that L4074 has two sections like L4072 (hard soil and soft soil). I opened two different bags, one for the hard soil and one for the soft soil. There were a lot of pottery pieces and some oven fragments in the soft soil.   In this locus, three carbon samples (C.4.4073.7 and 8 and 11), a plaster sample (C.4.4073.9), and a small piece of metal, possibly iron (C.4.4073.10). Also we found a mouse skeleton, which was 160 cm from the south baulk about 150 cm from the east baulk. I took a photo of this skeleton and I placed it in a foil packet for preservation.   Also, I found some stone pieces about 50 cm from the east baulk and 150 cm from the south baulk. I thought that it was pieces of a stone wall.   After breakfast, I delineated the trench by inserting stakes 0.5 m from the baulks and strung the trench lines. Meanwhile, a worker who had started to dig L4088 to see if there was a foundation yesterday, continued to widen this locus. Then, I decided there was not a foundation.   We cleaned the trench for the photo because I decided that wall L4070 and L4071 should be removed. I took some photos from the top of the van, but could not get all of the walls, so we took new photos. After that, we put the tent back up on the top of the trench.    We started to dig the clearing locus L4090, which was above L4091, L4063, L4066, L4053, L4068, and L4035. Today, we dug only in the north of L4091 and found an iron sample (C.4.4090.4), which may have come from a modern layer. We also found two carbon samples (C.4.4090.5 and 7), three plaster samples (C.4.4090.6 and 8 and 10), and a shell sample (C.4.4090.9).

L5099 and some of L5100 were excavated several centimeters and L5099 is beginning to look like perhaps some sort of pebble/stone filled wall with mudbricks on the outside. The only problem with this theory is that the apparent orientation, SW-NE, is contrary to that of the rest of the Ubaid structure contexts to which we believe it is associated. Obviously, this brings into question whether the two are contemporary or sequential, but hopefully further digging will clear up these contexts_Ñé relation.   In the SE, the area N of the old oven of the mudbrick structure was excavated as L5108, but revealed little new information. The exact position of the oven_Ñés N wall remains unclear.   In the N part of the trench, the central-N was excavated about 5-10 centimeters. Several remnants of what may be a surface or wall were discovered, but nothing continuous or substantial enough to be traced. As such, the remnants were removed after being photographed.   Also, the higher organic feature, L5095, was finally removed, revealing some mudbrick collapse underneath. L5085 was also excavated to reveal what is either a nasty pit or something contemporary with the other contexts but on the other side of a wall.

Our working focused on Loc 11. Locus 11 is located in the northwest portion of the first step of the trench. It is composed of the fill surrounding a row of rocks. The purpose of working in this locus is to see if these rocks are floating or if there are more courses. Bradley thinks they might be connected with rocks that have appeared in locus 3 (these rocks do not yet have a locus number). Aziz cleaned the rocks and he took this locus down towards the level of locus 3. This revealed another course of stones under the original row of rocks (we will give this a locus number tomorrow). The rocks revealed by this excavation are generally speaking larger than the first row of rocks and I think these rocks are not related to the rocks appearing in locus 3.   We left them and we began work on Loc 16. The reason we have divided locus 16 from locus 11 is because we can see a to see a difference in the soil color. We took 5 cm from this locus and then noticed a small pit. We excavated the pit as locus 15. But the pit did not go deep down and we took out burnt soil from the pit (see the picture). After that, we turned back to Loc 16; we took down Loc 16 same as the bottom of the Loc15. The removal of locus 15 revealed another cobble surface. Hoping to find more cobbles under locus 11 we took locus 11 down to the level of the bottom of locus 16and found that the cobbles do not continue. For this reason we will continue to keep these areas separate. We found another small shallow pit in locus 11. The soil of this pit was burnt and darker than the surrounding soil so we opened new Loc 18 for the 2nd pit. (We took 2-soil samples from these pits) After that, we continued to dig Loc 11, which became loc 19 (Taken photos these 2 pits).   We are changing the loci in both of these areas because (Why?). Locus 11 will be locus 19 and locus 16 will change to locus 17. Tomorrow we would like to continue on Loc 19 then we will clean the loc 17 to see cobble surface exactly.

Cleaned up the north profile of L4008, which will be taken out. Heavily eroded since last season; appears little changed. This profile was drawn last year. Notable exception is the development of an ant colony right above the L4011 burial. This and the obvious rodent burrows in 4019, 4020 make turbation a strong potential factor affecting deposits.      Should also note that I screwed up the photos yesterday by taking motion pictures instead of stills on the digital camera. Will be able to retake a shot of the beginning of 4020 plus the close-ups of the two burials and other features. Previous strata overviews are lost, but were largely uninteresting and not much of a loss.

The first project to was the cleaning and generally making the trench ready for excavation. This meant a lot of cleaning loci.    This also meant we could go down a bit to see if there were more courses stone in the two foundation walls, described later. This was how ever not the case, so we carried on to the main objective of the period was the removal of the two stone foundations that had been dominating the trench for almost two seasons. The walls were renamed from L2048 to L2116 and from L2088 to L2117.    The largest one L2116 was removed as L2114 and L2120. The excavation of the sub wall fill, L2115, revealed that the foundation wall had been build on top of a mudbrick structure of some sort on the western side of the wall L2116. As we traced the mudbrick area it became clear that the area, L2122, encompassed two small pits identified last year, now relabeled from L2078 to L2123 and from L2100 to L2124. It became clear that the pits were centers of circular patterns of mudbrick. These mudbrick are trapezoid in shape.    The two pits, L2123 and L2124 were almost identical in every aspect. Both had a plaster topping, lined with potsherds, and filled with burned material (dirt) and many small potsherds.   The two pits and the circular structure around them only raise one question: What is it?   The other wall was removed as L2120, and the sub wall soil was removed as L2121.   Along the east baulk and in the southeast corner are two pits, one of them were fully excavated as L2128, but did not produce anything significant. The other, L2118, has not been fully explored as of yet.   Lastly we straigthed the south baulk, as it collapsed in 2001, it took two cleaning loci, L2127 and L2129 to do the job.         ,~: C-2-2002-07-015-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,"696,2002-07-15," F-7-2002-07-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7049,","   Weekly Trench    Area F   Trench 7   July 15, 2002      This week we finished taking down elevation in areas that were still above the surface debris seen in much of the trench. Once everything was at the same level, we laid a 1x1 meter grid throughout the trench.      The main idea behind the grid system is mainly an in-depth analysis of where debris lies in relation to some of the features in the trench.      Before we pushed down the elevation, Chiara came to identify some of the bones I had in my trench. They were mainly sheep, goat, and cattle.      We then began to push down elevation everywhere in the trench. We did not find a lot more debris. I think that we were either on the surface and have now excavated it, or we still need to push down a few more centimeters to reach it.      The most notable find from this week was a small figurine that is about 4 cms long and is missing its head (L7067 #9). We also found a nice obsidian blade (L7048 #4).

During the course of this, it became apparent that this was not just one wall but actually four different architectural features/surfaces. So it has been separated into 1069 (which is the southernmost five-course wall), 1077 (which is some sort of rock pile joining 1069 with the northern sections), 1075 (which is the possible passage area with the two anomalous white flagstones with pot shards and slag between), and 1081 (which is the carefully laid cobble surface to the north).      Also L1068, the ash pit in the northeast corner, was taken down to a harder clay-like surface. A good deal of ash was removed, but nothing suggesting an oven appeared.      While looking for more connections between all the happenings on the eastern baulk and the rest of the trench, little has become apparent at this time. A current excavation goal is to begin bringing the different parts other trench to the same level so that a clear stratigraphic procession can be established.      This week we also had an aborted baulk drawing session. The wind picked up (to put it mildly) and a dust storm almost blew us from the tepe.

We do however have some interesting information to work with. Due to the way we are digging this trench L1, the topsoil locus, is still up and running even though we are digging things below it in other areas of the trench.   We have a large rock formation in the southern half of the trench that I am inclined to think is a burial. This is L3 and it is located only about 30 cm below the surface. It is a mound of cobbles all around 10cm in diameter. By adding an extra cut to the original 1 meter probe of this trench we were able to follow the stones west into other areas of the trench. The stones stay the same small size and do no extend further north or south and so keep the same length. It is due to the rounded nature of the mound, its small width, only 1 meter, and the fact that the stones are only about 2 meters in length, that I think that this is a burial. In the midst of the stones we also found a nice pedestal base L3 KT 1.   Other areas of the trench are also interesting. We have found some flat lying potsherds in the northern most portion of the trench in L4. There was also a potsmash in L5 in the southeastern area of the locus. Currently things are unclear, but the goal for next week is to understand what the rock formation is and then take it out so we can continue pushing down.     ,~: F-14-2002-07-15-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 14,"699,2002-07-15," D-7-2002-07-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 7,","   Today we have started to work by taking an elevation. Our working has focused on Loc 11 because we would like to see a continuation of the rocks. Aziz cleaned the rocks and he took down towards Loc 3. The result of going deeper showed us another stone wall appeared the old wall. However, more rocks, which were excavated from the deep surface, were bigger than the old rock walls and not related with each other. So we did not think it is a continuation of the old rocks. We left them and we back to the work on Loc 16 to see reason of the different color of the surface. We have take down 5 cm then we excavated a small pit so we opened new Loc for the pit, Loc 15. But the pit did not go deep down and we took out burnt soil from the pit (see the picture). After that, we turned back to Loc 16; we took down Loc 16 same as the bottom of the Loc15. Besides, on the bottom of the Loc 15, we analyzed cobble surface again. Moreover, we wanted to see continuation of the Loc 16`s surface on the Loc 11 so we took down Loc 11 but we did not see any continuation. On the other hand, we saw new pit because soil was burnt and darker than the other part so we opened new Loc 18 for the 2nd pit. (We took 2-soil sample from these pits) After that, we continued to dig Loc 11, which became loc 19 (Taken photos these 2 pits).   Tomorrow we would like to continue on Loc 19 then we will clean the loc 17 to see cobble surface exactly. Besides, we are sure that the surface does not continue neither on Loc 19 or Loc 20.

The N portion of the wall did not go much deeper than the S end. The elevation difference can be explained by the rocks sinking into the soft soil of the foundation trench and that the wall was on a slight incline. We also began to dig the pit that comes out of the east baulk and cuts into the wall. Inside the pit we found a bit of cement-like conglomerate(15cmx3cm). In the eastern most part of the pit, the part that cuts through the wall we found that there are many oven fragments (two large bags worth, C.3.3077.5 and C.3.3077.8) present. They are all located in the same area. Among the oven fragments we found 2 broken grinding stones C.3.3077.9 and C.3.3077.10. Also in the pit we found seven carbon samples. We did not find the bottom of the pit because I slowed the workers down thinking they had cut through the bottom of the pit, but it was only shadows fooling me.

We started the day by spraying the trench down and looking for more walls. We found two bricks in the far SE corner of the trench, almost in the very corner. These bricks unfortunately didn_Ñét appear to connect at any point with the other wall locus near it, L1069. These two bricks were given the L1076. We will have to see in the coming days if this is a wall structure or if it is only a small brick structure unrelated to any wall.      Digging wise we got a lot of work done, although the only things we have to show for it are some pottery and bone bags and obsidian fragments. In a large area of L1071 we went down about 10 cm. This was the south half of L1071, which is basically a quarter of the trench, the SW quadrant. The soil here appeared to be similar to the rest of 1071. At times it appears to be a hard chunky locus, but looking at the soil doesn_Ñét reveal any pattern or outline of any bricks that would indicate that we shouldn_Ñét blast through this area.      We also dug down in L1074, the area that is in the N half of the trench, which is to the N of the pit-like area L1075 and to the W of the wall-like structure 1073. The soil of this locus appeared to have some more ash lenses in it than L1071, which was the original reason for splitting up those loci. Other than that it appeared to be pretty hard and things like that, but no real rhyme or reason to the mudbrick like material.      That was all for today.

We are also taking down locus # 3 on both sides of the pit. I kept intact an area of about 0.30 meters on each side of the pit to prevent the workers from destroying parts of it.    Soon we encountered another pit adjacent to the East baulk and closer to the North baulk than locus # 4. We spent some time collecting and sifting the contents of this much smaller pit, which contained animal bone and some ash, but no burned materials. It would appear that the pit was used for refuse rather than for cooking or storage, this pit is not as symmetrically round as other pits found in the area.    At the bottom of locus 4 we located either a cobblestone lining on half of the pit or a surface. The cobbles are about 0.05 to 0.10 meter in size. The Western half of the pit has a very hard surface that the workers likened to cement. It has the look of a wall but at this point very little of it is visible and available for observation. We may have to wait until removal of the pit before we can better ascertain what it is.    As this was being done and as we worked on locus 3 near locus 2 we began uncovering a surface of cobbles of about 0.05 to 0.10 meters long covering the width of the trench. This is highly promising as a sealed surface and looks like a very good surface that we may get to excavate more extensively this received locus # 6.     ,~: F-15-2002-07-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 15/Locus 2,"703,2002-07-16," F-14-2002-07-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 14/Locus 1,","   AREA: F TRENCH: 14   JUL 16, 2002    Firstly, L1, L2, L3, L4 and L5 were cleaned. And then, for L1 (3m from south baulk; 4.80m from north baulk and 1.56m from west baulk; 1.40x1.20m) elevations were taken and it was dug 5cm to see that the rock area (L3 which is east part of this part of L1) is continuing through there or not. Finally, same surface of L3can be seen on here so the locus name of this area was changed as L3. Before finishing its cleaning the photographs of this area were taken.    The north part of this area was dug around 20cm to see clearly rock face under L1. On this area, some burned pieces of same vessel were found (KT24) with many potteries. However, this area did not have many lithics. Finally, this area was cleaned and its elevations were taken.

It seems that the surface does not underlie either walls 15 or 18, although it is more probable that wall 18 is built over the surface. A brick was removed in the northwest corner of the surface to reveal a few white streaks, suggesting that the surface meets wall 18 or that the wall is built on top of the surface. The extent of the surface on the western side follows the boundary of wall 15 on the wall_Ñés eastern boundary. As a result, it is difficult to be certain that wall 15 does not extend to the depth of the surface and is not contemporary with it. Excavation of locus 20 to the west of the surface and north of wall 15 needs to continue to establish the relationship between the walls and the surface.      Other work concentrated on leveling locus 17, segregating the brownish area to the north and excavating the installation, locus 24.

For example, there was a soil color change over a large portion of the E-baulk, in L5101, and nearby what looked to be a floating fragment of an oven wall. But today we got deep enough that it all came together to be revealed as a very large oven, ~2.5m diameter and slightly ovoid. At the moment it even appears to be contemporary with the Ubaid contexts to its W and S.   Similarly, in the central-W a poorly understood area of soil texture change, L5085, has revealed itself to be a pit and combined with the other pits and possible surface tumble in the N and NE helps explain the jumbly mix in that region of the trench.   The only sizable region where basic understanding still seems to be lacking is the central region of the trench where in L5103 there is a large concentration of mudbrick but a good wall has yet to be uncovered.

Then we stopped that because we were facing the possibility of losing context if we kept digging down in the ashy dirt.      We have a goal. My goal is to drop the trench down to the level of the stone cobbles, which are at the level of the bottom of the pit, which is currently L1057. This is at about 567.80m. Right now that is only about 20 cm lower than the rest of the trench.

Major props go out to my area supervisor and lovely wife Dawnell for showing me the soil change. Coming out of the south baulk there was a weird plastery thing that was very hard to dig. This seemed totally different from any other soil in the trench so we gave this small .3 x .4 m area the name of L1079.       Finally, noticed today that the pit 1075 was actually not a pit but was probably an ashy layer, which was underneath the clay surfaces 1071 and 1074.

The elevations and photographs of L3 (the rock area which is middle east of the trench) were taken. The opinion about L3 was that: It could be a burial because of the rock surface, pottery, pieces of the same vessels, grindstone and bones which could be seen below soil of L3. For this reason, firstly, the area that was around 60cm width was dug from east part of L3 to the west. On this area; a grindstone (KT5; 570.65; on the top soil), a possible pipe (KT8; 570.53), a pestle (KT9; 570.63) and a nice big bone (570.54; its photograph was taken) were found. The soil of this area was sifted but we could not find enough finds; so, for the other part of L3 we did not silf the soil. 2 lt. soil samples were taken from L3 as possible surface. And we continued to dig the other part of L3 through the west. There were many pottery (a pedestal pottery with finger figures (fingernail impressions), some pieces of the same vessels, a handle pottery and the other pottery) and many animal bones. Some pieces of a vessel were left in place. The photographs of some finds were taken and also after digging and cleaning elevations of L3 were taken.     At this time, the north part of L2 (the locus on S.E. of the trench), which could not be dug on Jul 16, 2002, was dug and its elevations were taken.    On the other locus, L5 (the south part of the rock area-L3), there were some rocks and pottery that could not be taken on Jul 16, 2002 due too not enough time were taken.

No clear cultural features were revealed in either case, and excavation ceased with the exposure of human burials in each area. In the northeast section of the trench, the human remains took the form of several elements of a human hand (Locus 4023). Follow-up work within this locus located no further human bone and it was closed after clearing a 1x1 section.   The two burials in the southeastern section of the trench (Loci 4024 and 4025) are both juveniles. 4025 appears to be a newborn and has not yet been touched. Attention has instead focused on 4024 and two other burials originally located last year (Loci 4026/4011 and 4027/4012; the number before the slash corresponds to the locus number assigned this year, the number after the slash that assigned last year.). Of these, 4026 is a younger individual similar in size (and probably age) to 4024. 4027 is a larger, older individual, but still subadult. Although aging has not yet been done on the skeletons, burial 4027 appears to be between 10-14 years of age, and 4024 and 4026 between 2-4 years.   Unlike previously excavated burials, 4024, 4026, and 4027 all have grave goods associated with them. 4024 had a stone bead necklace, 4026 a bracelet (ceramic?) and one small bead, and 4027 a copper or bronze earring. Excavation of 4024 and 4027 is incomplete, so additional material may come up. This is especially true for 4027, which is only beginning to be exposed. Since we lack defined dates for the burials exhumed so far, we hope that stylistic variation in these artifacts will provide a clearer indication of their ages.   The only other item of interest is the relationship between the 4027 burial and Locus 4015. Locus 4015 was an elongated, oval shaped patch of slightly darker and much softer sediment identified in the bottom of the L4008 trench last year. It currently looks as if L4015 is the uppermost incidence of L4027. All of the material removed so far has been in soft sediments under 4015, and the orientation of the skeleton as excavated suggests that it will continue. If so, this is the first time that a burial has been indicated prior to discovery by a soil change.   A possible exception to this phenomenon may be several dense patches of stone found in the eastern portion of Trench A4 and in locus 6000 of Trench A6. One such patch (a \cist tomb\) contained a human burial beneath, and if it marks a consistent pattern may provide another indicator of burials prior to encountering them directly.     ,~: A-4-2002-07-017-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4,"716,2002-07-17," D-5-2002-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 5   July 17, 2002      Today L5085 was definitively revealed to be a pit (by a plaster lining and appropriately lying pottery obviously a much later period than that just to the S) and larger than originally thought.

However, as L5085 becomes more and more clearly revealed as a plaster-lined pit I am doubting my original designation of L5087 as a mudbrick wall as part of that designation relied upon that same plaster as being a coating on the outside of a mudbrick wall, which it now clearly is not. Rather, I now suspect pit L5085 cuts whatever was occurring with the Ubaid-contemporary contexts as they continued northward.   In the central-W, organic feature L5098 continues below still more mudbrick collapse, but I have found an area where it takes an upturn, which may be indicative of its northernmost extent.   What is occurring in the far North still remains unclear to me, however. Either the area is still surface tumble, which seems somewhat unlikely, especially in the W or the area is simply cut by a number of, or a few very large, pits_ÑÓwhich may be the case as areas of soft soil and ash concentrations keep popping up. To investigate I opened a new locus in the N as a sounding level (L5113) to try and figure the area out.        ,~: D-5-2002-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,"717,2002-07-17," D-6-2002-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 1,","   Trench D6 Daily July17, 2002      We start to articulate the furnace chambers with much caution, beginning with L24 (South) and L28 (North). We also clear the area just to the East of L20. In all of these areas we collect 100% of the soil and mudbrick debri for sampling and analysis. We came across a large piece of carbon in L24 and discovered much more slag on both the North and South walls. At this point we had a clearer view of the oven and found more evidence that only the first (L24), third (L26) and fifth (L28) contained slag. In chamber L27 we found the same layering of large pottery sherds that we found in L25 (about 5 large (10 x10 cm) thick sherds lining an sloped surface (about 45%) joining the West wall of the furnace.       To the West of L20 we dig a 20 x 20 cm section into L22 looking for the foundation of L20. About 10 cm down we came across large rocks that continue, possibly a foundation for the furnace.

The locus was opened, so we might at some point will be able see how many courses of mudbrick is preserved, in the platform and the other mudbrick structures in that part of the trench.   Started two loci more as a result of L2132: L2133 and L2134. L2133 is the area along the north baulk that might be a mudbrick wall, the material in this locus is anyway very mudbricky. L2134 had already been identified as a mudbrick wall beneath L2106, along the east baulk, three mudbrick visible.   Started by excavating L2132, thereby assigning three KT_Ñés: C.2.2132.1-3, being pottery, lithics and bone. Found several pieces of charcoal, all in all seven samples during the excavation of this locus 2132, C.2.2132.4-10. As we excavated closer to the mudbrick platform, I noted that the soil along the platforms brick, roughly 3-5 cm from the platform, that had different color and a plaster like quality, and therefore saved this plaster from excavation.   In the southern end of the locus we could see the dirt and stones build up against the fill being excavated.

Subsequent removal of locus 25, which was distinguished by the overlying locus 20 due to its comparable elevation with loci 21 and 18, found another white organic surface (locus 30) at 25 cm below the other surface. Interestingly the reeds are placed in a diagonal orientation to the rest of the trench, unlike surface 21, which lies at a right angle to the baulks.       Excavation of loci 23 and 17 revealed that a clear soil change exists between 17 in the south and 23 in the north. The latter consists of a fine brown soil, and is bounded in the north by a similar fill to locus 17 (locus 26). Locus 23 defined the parameters of the installation 24 because of its distinct soil compared to 17 and 26, and the mud brick line of locus 24 running north-south in the east.

There is no evidence of bonding between 1077, 1069, and 1075. 1077 seems to be crudely mortared stones linking the two sections, but not bonding with either of them. 1069 could not be removed in entirety until 1077 was first removed, so it is hypothesized that 1077 came after 1069.

We also are digging the large pit that cut the wall L3068. This pit also seems to cut through both Iron Age and 2nd Millennium surfaces, so, it could be that the pit was originally cut through the wall for a small oven which was later destroyed ( we found the remains, oven fragments found in the pit, KT) and a large square oven L was built on top, also being founded on the remnants of wall L3068.

After this we had the main man of the Tepe, Andy, come on down and spray to see what exactly was going on in this trench focusing on the three wall structures that we have uncovered so far, loci 1069, 1073, 1076. In the end we had a new theory when it came to my trench. This theory is that these aren_Ñét wall at all, but instead of pavements and stuff like that. The clicker is that we have been able to cut right up to the loci and you can see pretty clearly that they only appear to be one course in section. For the most part, if it is a large pavement we have chopped through most of it, which would be okay, since we couldn_Ñét ever pick it out. And it wasn_Ñét just me either, as Dawnell and Andy were also unable to pick anything out.      Today we went all the way down in the part that had been added to L1075. This is an ashy area in the middle of the trench we thought had been a pit, but it was not.      We also took down the area to the south of the brick structure L1069. This area was part of two loci, L1061 and L1077.      We also took down some of the area next to L1073 farther down, about 10 cm. This is L1072, the area to the E of the brick structure.      We also pushed down in L1074 about 5 cm, although closer to the wall to make it level it was closer to 15 cm. This was because we were trying to follow the ashy layer L1075 underneath L1074, which but for a small area doesn_Ñét appear to occur.      So that is what went on today in my trench. I feel from the lack of artifacts associated with what we are excavating that none of what we have been excavating has been a surface and that the cobbles at the bottom of L1057 still stand the best chance for architecture, although we could hit the wall of said structure before we hit the surface.

We saw a difference in soil at 598.08 m. The top is a loose animal burrow riddled loamy dirt that is inconsistently packed, while the soil underneath is a hard packed clayey soil that has a reddish tint.

I am now changing the confusing area as L3080 and will remove it separately just to be careful. The soil is different from the soil N of it, which is hard packed and without animal burrows. This (L3080) could be a pit next to the big pit L3077, but I can_Ñét find a pit line in section, it could be an expansion of L3077, but in section the soil does not look the same and I cannot find a connecting line in the baulk. It could also be a fill layer that has many soft areas in it resulting in concentration of animal burrows.   We also took a look at the section of the exploratory window in L3072, which is the locus in the SE portion of the trench and saw a surface level at 598.26, which is the same level that the 2nd millennium surface found in the bottom of pit 3064 is. Also L3070 is approximately at the same height at the two above surfaces. It will be interesting to see if the areas turn out to be the same or related surfaces.

In the central portion things also went well, if somewhat slowly. We are exposing some more large pot sherds that are probably from the same pot as some previously removed sherds, lending more credibility to the thick area of collapse theory.

The south side of the trench is the surface that has the locus number as 4065 (we have covered this surface to protect the ceramics and the tiny bones on it). We worked on three locia at the same time; 4066, 4074 and 4075, these are on the west of the trench (the south quarter of the west side). Then we began to excavate on the north side of the trench.

We began by big picking the entire length of the trench in the meter strip. Although we did not dig very deep, only 15cm, there was a lot of pottery that came out of the trench. Additionally there was a nice hammer stone that was retrieved as well. There was a change in soil color early on in the digging to a light brown. This is why L1 was changed to L2 after only 15 cm or so of depth. Normally topsoil is deeper than this in the area, but I felt the color change warranted a change in locus.

This surface is the best-preserved organic white surface thus far, containing deep reed impressions. It is not clear which wall is associated with this surface since definition of wall 15 in particular has not helped to establish its bottom elevation. Nevertheless a further white surface against the western baulk below the level of locus 21 definitely terminates the extent of wall 15. The reed surface 21 will be sampled and consolidated for further analysis. Interestingly the reed surfaces may reflect the orientation of the architecture in that the reeds are aligned in parallel lines, presumably in line with the walls.      The northern part of the trench continued to produce a gravely fill excavated as locus 17. A mud brick alignment on the northern edge of locus 17 produced some concentrations of metal and slag and was posited as a potential oven or metal working installation. Excavation of this installation did not produce any finds to confirm or disprove this idea.

It appears to be moving steadily towards the West of the trench. We collected new soil samples for this location and are visually collecting but decided against sifting all of its contents. Note again that these materials are likely contemporary with those of Locus 8.    This layer of ash seems pretty well compacted and noticeably darker than the soil next to it. The ash layer also lacks the white pebbly stuff found earlier and throughout this level. This is interesting because the layer being too long to be a pit might indicate an area of refuse, yet why didn_Ñét it become commingled with the white pebble soil? Was the ash layer deposited all too quickly through an intense fire to have avoided \contamination\? Is the ash_Ñés provenience from a workshop or kiln setting? How large is it? It is fine and dark. Why was it deposited here? And by who? The direction that the ash takes may help indicate that it was leaning against something like a wall or that it would have followed a road, or a natural bend or depression in the topography.    As we continue on this locus we sprayed the East baulk and floor where the appearance of a wall is quite certain, the mortar lines for two courses are visible on the baulk, by spraying with water we were able to follow the wall across the trench into the West baulk in an almost straight line (interesting how these walls almost always run across the trench like that ;o) ) This is to say that we are not 100 % sure of the patterns and what we can see give us reason for excellent likelihood of it. Of course a wall across the trench is too good to be true so we will use caution for the moment.

A large portion of the N region is occupied by an ashy pit/deposit, as is the NW, with its very own ash pit, and the NE, where surface tumble may still be the order of the day. The ashy pit/deposit, L5116, was partially excavated today, turning up the usual selection of finds (pottery, animal bone, some carbon and a few lithics) and a nice bronze pin, KT 5116.1.   Elsewhere in the trench, continued excavation of L5100, which I am relatively certain is now collapse, in the central region of the trench revealed a complete small bowl (KT 5100.27) and screening caught a broken bone bead (KT 5100.33). Some work was also done in abutting stone concentration L5099. My current guess is that the area is not a wall but rather just organized-appearing collapse as organic surface L5098 looks to be plunging beneath.   In addition to looking to go under L5099, uncoverment of the feature to the E, in L5108 revealed some fragments of metal, presumably copper given the expected age of the surface, literally resting on the organic material. Though there was no in tact artifact remaining, the material was collected for possible chemical analysis as KTs 5108.14, 5108.15 and 5108.16.   Finally the portion of last year_Ñés oven (associated with S mudbrick house) which had been pedestaled earlier in this year_Ñés excavation was removed as L5115. Excavation uncovered some pottery but nothing really typical of an oven (ash or burnt material) which leads me to believe the context is finished.

This harder soil has been designated as locus 29.      Pieces of pottery and bone are turning up, leading to a need for a change in locus in loci 17/27. The latter loci preserve a pattern witnessed in the southern portion of the trench, where reddish brown compact fills are confined to the eastern baulk whilst browner and looser fills occupy the western side of the trench. A north-south separation of the two loci is attested here also.       The northern extreme of locus 26 contains substantial gravel and loose material with pottery and bone. It represents probable mixed material, similar to locus 2 since it is located near the spill line.      My general impression is that the increase in the concentration of pottery and bone in the above northern fills, together with the appearance of the wall slump in locus 29, signals the approach of a surface. Locus 29 especially forced a change in loci and it was found that loci 27 and 17 in fact gave way to a uniform fill below them, consisting of a broken up, clay-like layer full of mud brick debris, not dissimilar to locus 17.

There were many large pieces of pottery including several large rimsherds and a substantial pedestal base. After looking at the pottery and the section it seems that we may have pushed through a surface of some sort. The large nature of the pieces denotes that they have not been moved around a lot and therefore were not subjected to movement and forces that would have broken them into smaller pieces. I closed L2.   After toweling and scraping the soil it became clear that three new loci were needed. The north area of the one meter strip (the longest point from the north baulk running to the south is 1.53m) is a hard, chunky clay area. Some sections of this clay appear to be smoother than others leading us to believe that a wall or some other feature might be emerging. This is L3.   The central portion of the one meter strip is .89m at its longest and became L4. It is a very soft area of earth and may in fact be a pit. There is also ash in the soil.   L5 is the southern end of the trench and is 2.29m at its longest point. It is a browner soil containing the white pebbles associated with virgin soil. It is soft, but firmer than the ashy soil in the center of the trench.   I pushed down L5 15 cm to see if the same hard clay that was present in L3 would come up. Since the trench is on a slope I thought it could have been at a lower elevation. When we stopped today (which was at breakfast because the workers were needed elsewhere) it did not look as if we had reached the clay.

Once the trench was cleaned, we continued pushing down elevation in the northern part of the trench. No loci were opened or closed, but there were a few finds worth mentioning.      In quadrant D6 in L7070, we found a small smooth rock that was red on both sides. A possible purpose that was proposed by Andy was a pottery burnishing tool. It was listed as a small find and is KT#39.      We also found a small metal pin in quadrant C5 in locus 7069. We do not have any photos of it in situ as it came up while we were sweeping.

On this locus I have 7 parts right now that I have mentioned them with Roman numerals. The \I\ part is 0.70cm, that is because of the sounding D3_Ñés south baulk was there. By the way there is only 7 to 8cm left to be at the same level with the sounding D3. But, the level changes on the west side of the trench and the sounding D3 (the reason for this is being located on the slope of the Tepe). I have started to excavate L4065from the north of the locus, as mentioned before I have given Roman numerals to each part and the area that is 0.70cm is part \I\.

As this was being done we found another concentration of cobblestones that would seem to be contemporary with the cobblestones in locus 4. Part of our labors switched to the smaller tools like trowels and carefully began to isolate and articulate this feature. While doing this and to the Southeast of locus 4 we may also have located another pit as we are finding lots of bone. We have also collected a number of interesting pieces of ceramics.   With most of locus 7 removed clear almost to the South end of the trench, we will continue to work on articulating the cobblestones on locus 6 and in the new locus # 13.

The workers worked with a trowel, so the work was done slowly. During excavation, we found a carbon sample (C.4.4090.22), two pieces of shell (C.4.4090.23) and a possible iron sample (C.4.4090.25). Also, we found oven fragments, which was on top of the burnt soil. I thought this was an oven, but did not take a soil sample. I will take the soil sample when we dig L4066.   I took out only tow pieces of oven fragment (C.4.4090.24) and I took a photo of this possible oven area. Meanwhile one worker was digging to remove L4092, which was above wall L4070.

When we looked at the baulk in the SE we saw that most of the mudbrick collapse was in this region so we changed the east half of L6 to L8 which is mostly mudbrick collapse mixed with ashy fill. We changed the west half of L6 to L9, which is the mostly ashy fill mixed with mudbrick.       In L7 this week we defined the wall and cut and sprayed and took many pictures of it. It apprears to be at least 8 courses of two color bricks with a grey hard packed clay that resembles mudbrick as the bottom course. This course may be poorly preserved or is a foundation for the wall. We also discovered that the ash from L8 and L13 continue beneath the wall to its north side. The wall appears to be directly on top of this fill. We are currently articulating the north side of the wall for any surfaces or a continuation of the ash fill.      We opened L8 as an area of more concentrated mudbrick debris at the east half of the area south of the wall. We opened it because we say that the east half of L6 was getting more and more mudbrick coming up as opposed to the west half of the locus that was more ashy. We cleared a great deal of fill in L8 and eventually the locus continued to the west baulk because we found that a lot of the soft texture to the soil was coming from animal burrows within the mudbrick collapse. We had thought the soft area was a separate locus so we opened and then closed L9 in the SW corner of L6 until we realized it was a burrow. In L8 we found a great deal of plaster chunks, which were layered between mudbrick like pieces. Each piece had a thick layer of white plaster at the top and some thinner lines of plaster between more layers of brick-like fill. The plaster peels away perfectly from the fill. I found it all over L8 and also found it in other loci, 12 and 13. I also thought that I may have found it on the wall in L7, which lead me to think that the plaster was mortar but I can_Ñét be sure until I actually chop down the wall. We also found some greenish rocks that were like pieces of clay, I was told that this is the kind of rock used to plaster walls, it is mixed with water and then brushed onto the mudbrick walls of houses in the nearby villages. I collected many samples of this in L8, 13, and 12. After scraping around uncertainly for days we decided to cut a section about .30m x .80m about .30 deep to see what was below all of the mudbrick and ash mess. We found a few more courses to the wall and a continuation of the ash layer beneath all of the mudbrick debris.       L9 was originally opened as western half of the fill south of the wall in L7, below L6. But after scraping around we found that ash was very mixed and was mostly mudbrick debris. We took a few rock samples while we were scraping around of the green rock and the plaster when we first began to see it come up. After scraping we realized that L9 is nothing more than a few large animal burrows at the SW corner of the trench. We cleaned out the burrows and closed the locus.       We opened L10 when we found some very hard fill mixed with lots of small rounded pebbles at the SE corner of L8. Originally thought this area was a wall but it is too hard and full of pebbles. Because of similar features found in Area C, I thought it might be related to metal working in some way, but upon further examination it was not the same substance as we found two years ago so most likely it is just extremely compacted clay. We closed the L10 when found more ashy fill beneath it. We picked off the mudbrick fill (L8) on top of the ash but the ash stopped at the center of the locus.    L8 remained as a mixed fill locus for a while until we believed once again that the two kinds of fill were separate entities. L13 became the ashy fill mixed with mudbrick collapse, which was predominantly in the east half of L8 and L14 is the west half of L8 where the mudbrick debris is more concentrated than the ash.    In L13 we went down the bottom of the wall. Originally the ashy fill was only in the east half of the area south of the wall but it eventually was uncovered in the entire area. So L13 is now below L14. The bottom of the wall in L7 is more ashy fill, and it appears to continue to the north side of the wall in L12. This locus is still a mix of ash and mudbrick debris but currently it is mostly ash. The hard spots of fill are concentrated at the south east and west baulk.       L14 we opened at the west half of the mudbrick debris area south of the wall. As we trimmed it back towards the west baulk we found more and more ashy fill, so this locus began to shrink. At the center of the west baulk we hit upon mudbrick debris about .30m wide that was two different colors. The north half was a green/grey mudbrick and the south half was red/orange. Neither section had any definite lines or bricks so we changed KT bags and cleared them. The red section of mudbrick did not have any artifacts.       L12 we opened as fill north of the wall in L7. Originally the area was part of L7 because I thought I could see the tops of bricks on the floor in front of the section of the wall we had cut through when we originally found the wall. We cut 5cm off the top of the area adjacent to the existing wall (about .5m wide). We were only able to find a few bricks in the east half of the locus, not the other side. We continued to take the area down a few centimeters at a time, expanding it out another meter under L5, looking for any surfaces associated with the wall . We found some ash underneath the center of the wall and it extends out .20m from it. We have been coming down around it trying to find more of it and leaving that particular area pedastalled. We will change locus of the ash area and continue to cut a few centimeters a time in this area until we find something new.      We opened L11 as a baulk cleaning locus. We are preparing to draw my over 2m high south baulk. We only got a few pot sherds out of it.      I also went through and re-measured my entire trench to find out just how off my day plan has been. The elevations are correct but the lengths of the steps were off. I have also started facing my day plan with north going up on the page because I was not setting it properly on the page previously.      To sum up the week, we basically spent a lot of time south of the wall L7, looking for surfaces or at least the end of the wall itself. All we found was layer after layer of ash mixed with mudbrick debris, the good news is that the ash appears to be getting darker as we go further down, possibly coming up on a installation of some sort. We did find the bottom of the wall on its southern side but are still working on the northern area. We will be cutting down the topsoil and subtopsoil at the end to step while working on the area north of the wall to find the bottom of it so we can take down the wall in the next few days.     ,~: A-9-2002-07-021-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,"764,2002-07-21," C-5-2002-07-021-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 5,","   Week 3  summary   Area C   Trench 5      Taraw and I started the excavation of this 1 meter x 1 meter sounding in Area C. We are trying to establish the chronology of the Area and figure out the depth of the cultural material. We want to excavate the sounding quickly, but still try to associate artifacts and features in their appropriate contexts. We_Ñére digging in 20-30 cm levels unless we notice a change in soil, a new feature, wall, burial, etc.      Locus 1 was topsoil with some pottery and bone. The soil was silty, light brown. The sub-topsoil layer starting in locus 2 was a clay loam that had small spots of a white mineral mixed into it. This soil reminds me of what we_Ñéve been seeing in Area F---and generally labeling virgin soil. Locus 2, however, produced some bone but no pottery was found.       We started finding a small amount of mudbrick in locus 3. Also, the soil shifted back to a more silty type.       Locus 4 produced a lot of mudbrick. We could see the hint of two walls joining at a corner (90 degrees) in the middle of the trench. Though, it was difficult to determine any real mudbrick. The soil was a very compact reddish brown soil that was a mixture of both silty soil and mudbrick debris. Yet, there was a clear and definite border between silty soil and the combination of mudbrick and silty soil.       In locus 5 there was a decrease in the amount of mudbrick. Locus 6 was very similar to L5. At the bottom of L6 we started finding reed impressions. Thus, I started new locus 7. Andy came down and exposed the reed impressions, along wit the mudbrick that bordered it on the south and the west. Taraw and I tried to chunk out the rest of it using trowels. We_Ñéve saved as much of it as we could, and it now rests on Kathryn_Ñés desk waiting for a more permanent home. Illia found similar reed impressions at a similar elevation in Area A. He was able to attain a much better sample.      Locus 8 produced some more reed impressions, but they were very small and scattered. We also found some burned clay or mudbrick in the NE corner of the trench. The soil was a reddish-brown, not surprising due to the amount of mudbrick we_Ñéve been finding.       Locus 9 was very similar to L8. L10 produced a more checkerboard pattern, as we were actually able to clearly see a couple of mudbrick in the bottom of the trench.

The sounding revealed an infant jar burial under a hard mudbrick area, which looks to be a floor. The purpose for opening this trench was to excavate the area around the burial and hopefully find architecture and a domestic context associated with it, as this type of burial is often found under a floor. A one meter wide strip was placed down the center of the trench leaving a .50m baulk between it and the sounding.   It was excavated with a big pick at first and at this point in time we have moved to smaller hand tools. We went through the topsoil L1, very quickly and then a color change prompted a change to a new locus, L2, at an elevation that is higher than what I had expected. I assumed the topsoil would extend deeper. L2 is a subtopsoil layer, but at its end may contain remains from a possible surface that we may have picked through. Both L1 and L2 were rich in pottery. The sherds were large which we assume means they were not moved much and thus were not subject to stress that would break them into smaller fragments.   Below L2 were three new loci. There is chunky clay area in the northern end of the meter strip, L3. We have not excavated this locus yet, but the smooth nature of some areas of this clay may indicate that this is the top of a wall or feature, but some of the area was exposed giving it the chewed up chunky look.   South of this and cutting the end of the locus is L4 an ashy pit. This has not yet been excavated either, but will be done next week.   Finally the southern end of the meter strip in the trench became L5. This is a brown fairly soft soil that has the white pebbles indicative of the virgin soil in the area. This was excavated in the hopes that it would reveal the clay of L3 below. At this point that clay has not been found. The sounding section indicates that it should extend. The goal for the coming week is to excavate the pit, trace the clay further and determine if the clay is indeed a feature or just mud wash.     ,~: G-6-2002-07-021-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 6/Locus 3,"766,2002-07-21," D-5-2002-07-021-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Area D   Trench 5   Week Ending July 21, 2002      The main results of this week were the confirmation that the majority of the good contexts (L5079, 5094, 5098, 5097, 5099, 5100, 5101, 5103 and 5108) are indeed contemporary with the mudbrick structure uncovered last season. We were able to make this determination by following the grain surface, L5098, to below or abutting all the contexts and in the case of the former situation being able, usually due to sherd arrangements and finds composition, to make a strong argument that they are collapse from the original structure(s) onto the surface (which also helps explain its excellent preservation). The strongest point in the argument, though, is that the grain surface can be followed to the N wall of the mudbrick structure, where it abruptly stops, in some cases there is even Ubaid pottery lying in the grain material as it slightly curves up and abuts the wall. With a little luck, we may even be able to get carbon dates from the organic material.   Otherwise, in the E of the trench, a very large oven, L5111, has been discovered but is waiting to be excavated until we hopefully have the opportunity to get the W baulk down a bit this coming week. We are hoping to trace L5098 to (or under) it to determine how it relates to the other contexts. Also, in the WNW a much later pit has been uncovered which includes a few large, possibly cow bones. It looks to be cutting any contexts related to the grain surface, but it will be at least several days before we can be sure of that.     ,~: D-5-2002-07-021-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"767,2002-07-21," D-6-2002-07-021-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6,","   Trench D6 Weekly Summary #2&gt;through July 21      Our focus this week was to continue exposing the context and heart of the L20 furnace. We cleaned L14 and noticed some structure in it_Ñés debri, and are theorizing it may be some other furnace or structure. We continued to push down surrounding the furnace, further exposing the stones of wall 16. Our main artifact of currency appears to be slag, as we have continued to find it on a regular, if not frequent basis.       In the furnace itself we articulated the chambers and revealed a very symmetrical plan, with three smaller chambers (24, 26, 28) that appear to all be coated in slag (lots of slag) and two larger chambers distributed between the others. On the upper portion of one of these larger chambers (L27) we found pottery grouped on a (~35 degree) slanting surface facing East.      In the Northwest we found a pottery grouping of similar sherds to that which we also just found on the upper portion of chamber 27. We are theorizing this may be evidence of some work surface, possibly having to do with maintenance of the furnace.       We also wanted to discover the extent of the furnace, and to this end cut a section to try to reach its roots. However, we only discovered that L20 continues as far as the surface L17.

We removed 2 cm of material, bringing this locus to the level of the 2nd step (590.56). Within the center of this, leading from between L25 and 26, we found what might be a \drain\ for the oven, visible as a slightly harder channel. We dug a section (20 x 15cm, 14 cm deep- to the new level of L29/ 2nd step) in the East end of L25. We did not find any hard evidence here. We also excavated another 24 cm throughout L26, and found some evidence of a continuation. Tomorrow we will check for the other end of this drain, and verify its existence.       We excavated chamber L28 to the same as level as L29, L24, and the 2nd step, and found much mud brick debri and 10 large (~6 cm) pieces of slag at it_Ñés East entrance. In the interior (West) we found 7 large ( ~ 5 x 5 cm) pieces of slag that appear to have flaked off of the walls of the chamber. As usual we collected all soil and debri for sampling.      We continued to L6 and excavated around the remaining debri structure and to the N and E found much pottery (two full bags), lithics, bone and slag (KTs 50, 51, and 53) in the surrounding fill. The slag found here is a lighter green, different from that which is coming from the furnace (a darker green). We also found 1 small piece of iron (3 cm, KT 47) and a long obsidian blade ( 5.5 x 0.5 cm, black, KT 52). In the SE of L6 we found very hard soil (mudbrick?) and more furnace debri. In the NW of L6 we found a surface covered in very small pebbles, we will clean this tomorrow and give it a locus ID. This is 13 cm higher and is much different than surface L17 (to the South of L20).

Before this week we only knew of two areas of mudbrick, cleaned as L2122. This area contains two structures, a wall and something, which is somewhat difficult to describe, as it seems to be a structure centered on two small fire pits. Forming two circular patterns radiating out from the pits, by form of trapeziod mudbrick. The two structures seem to have been build up against each other and therefore could be from the same phase.    I opened L2132 next to the mudbrick platform, its function being to follow the mudbrick downwards, to see just how many courses that there was left standing. In the process of forming this locus (L2132), I also labeled the other two patches of mudbrick visible. These being L2133 and L2134, where L2134 is the best preserved, stretching along the northern part of the east baulk. Here I can clearly determine the size and number of mudbricks. L2133 on the other hand is a completely different story. The soil is very much like that you would expect in mudbricks. But here we could not find any believable mortar lines to give a precise indication of were the single mudbricks are. It would therefore indicate that this locus (L2133) is filled with mudbrick tumble and debris.   In the other end of the trench we began to work around the already excavated floor level. Trying to determine its strategraphical relation to the surrounding loci. It became clear that the surface had been constructed after the fill in L2132 had been deposited. As the surface seem to be sloping up against the fill. The fill actually being the fill below the now removed wall L2117.    Another way to study the surface material was also started as we started to excavate the part under the now removed wall (L2116, removed as L2108), that had covered an area of the surface in question. This area was excavated in two loci L2135 and L2136. L2135 did not result in finding a surface, only the border of it. While L2136 was all flat lying potsherds, stones and other things. It clear that L2136 must be equal to L2099, that was excavated last year.    One other project was the excavation of the pit L2128, which did not contain anything of interest. Note: because of over eagerness, we excavated through the pits bottom. So the last KT numbers are filled with mixed material.   Again this week did we try to clean the south baulk, making it ready for drawing, in doing so we cut 10cm off in selected areas of the baulk, that had cracked up. This was labeled L2137.        ,~: C-2-2002-07-022-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,"773,2002-07-22," F-1-2002-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1057,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 3   Area F   Trench 1   July 22, 2002      Slow week. We only worked four days, as Sunday was busy with other things. This week revealed no small finds or any interesting areas which were rich in artifacts. For the most part my trench continued to be one very stingy in the giving up of pottery and associated artifacts. There is pottery, and from the diagnostic work that has been done it definitely look Chalcolithic, but what we are lacking right now is a really good context with which to study the Chalcolithic period in this trench, architecturally speaking.      We spent most of the week pushing down trying to reach the cobble surface of the pit, cobbles which we have named L1057. We still haven_Ñét quite got there. In the meantime we continued to push down in the fill loci which we have, L1078 being the primary large fill locus where we have been digging.       Near the end of the week we encountered two parallel lines which were running through the trench which seemed to be way too close to being a wall to not be a wall. So we named this locus 1080. Also, to the S of the new locus we noticed some bricky material.       We haven_Ñét decided if this bricky material is part of slump from maybe the wall 1080, maybe some other wall which we haven_Ñét recognized. But maybe this is actually part of a pavement. If it is a pavement it is very difficult to realize where it is going.      On the other side of the trench we believe that the wall loci which we have previously uncovered L1069, L1073, and L1076 may all be actually parts of different pavements or the same pavement. We don_Ñét think that the walls are walls, I guess is what we are saying.      Hopefully we can figure out the trench soon and figure out where we are going and get some structure to have a better context. And cylinder seals.

The main goal of today_Ñés work was to get the fragile contexts, in particular the grain surface, sorted out before we start taking the W, and possibly a little of the S, baulks down a bit. We plan to take them down early next week.   Nothing remarkable was discovered, though of note the grain surface appears to peter out a bit as it approaches the western wall of oven L5111 so a nice stack of grain against the oven wall, which would be great for establishing a contemporary relation, might not be in the cards. When it comes to the oven, the final proof (as such exists in archaeology) may have to wait until the feature is excavated, probably mid next week. Still, there are some difficulties even in that because, where finding grain under the oven insures that it is a later feature, finding no grain could mean any of the following: a) the oven is contemporary; b) the oven is older so the grain surface was deposited later; or c) the oven is later and when built was done in such a way to cut the surface.   The other thing of note from today_Ñés excavations is that WNW late pit L5085 is much larger than I had originally anticipated. Its vertical extent (including that shown in the baulk) is now near 70 cm.   Finds worth mentioning include a possible figurine leg off the grain surface, KT 5103.33 and a pottery spindle whorl from the late pit, KT 5085.25.     ,~: D-5-2002-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,"775,2002-07-22," C-1-2002-07-022-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1071,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 4   Area C   Trench 1   July 22, 2002      In this week of excavation we started to get some new kinds of pottery that had not been seen in this area before. It is beginning to look like this second millennium area might actually be from the third millennium. Further excavation will hopefully shed more light on this.      The beginning of this week focused on the mudbrick surfaces of 1071 and 1083, working to an area below the walls that were built on top of them. The mudbrick continues, so they are possibly earlier mudbrick architectural features that were built upon for the later walls.      The trench is still a bit confusing with lines appearing in the trench floor everywhere, so 1085 will take down this confusion hopefully and get us clear information about what is going on here.      Two interesting features emerged this week, 1087 (a mudbrick surface of narrow bricks) and 1092 (a possible wall of stones laid on top of pot shards). 1087 is a slightly curving mudbrick surface (or possible collapse) of narrow mudbricks just to the west of 1083. The westernmost edge contains two courses of darker gray bricks with a light mortar. 1092 is an interesting feature of large squarish or rectangular stones laid on top of large pottery fragments that appear to be laid upon other stones. Possibly this is part of an outside surface where a great deal of smoke could easily be dissipated (possibility based on great concentration of carbon and ash on this side). There is also a visible line in the trench base that might indicate an outside and an inside surface.     ,~: C-1-2002-07-022-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1071,"776,2002-07-22," F-7-2002-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7052,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Area F   Trench 7   July 22, 2002      This week began with new fill loci being assigned in the trench. I changed the fill divisions from 2 fill loci, one on the interior of structure 7053 and one on the exterior of structure 7053, to five fill loci, 3 exterior and 2 interior. The rationale behind this was to keep the material remains that are definitely associated with the structure separate from those that only may be. The definite exterior locus is 7069 and the definite interior locus is 7070. The other possible exterior loci are 7071 and 7073. 7072 is the possible interior locus.      This week was productive in a few ways. Not only are we continuing to push down elevation on this context, we also took down surfaces 7049 and 7059. We took soil samples from each and collected all of the material. (there are carbon samples for 7049, none for 7059)       The burial 7054 was completely removed and we can continue with excavation in that area. Under the burial fill 7055, there was a large circular stone with a circular divot in it. It seems to be more likely associated with the wall 7053 rather than the burial!perhaps a doorpost.      The measured top plan was finished of this context (debris in relation to structure 7053) which is good as excavation can resume in the entire trench.      Some significant finds this week include a small metal pin L7069 KT#62 and some interesting stone tools (perhaps a small stone pestle L7070 #54 and a small burnishing tool L7070 #39)      Next week we will continue to excavate this context and hopefully find the surface associated with this debris and the structure of L7053.     ,~: F-7-2002-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7052,"777,2002-07-22," A-8-2002-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench    Area A   Trench 8   July 22, 2002      The whole morning was taken up with the removal of surface locus 21. Blocks of the surface, defined by the cracks caused by drying, were removed at approximately 15cm deep. A few sherds fell from the matrix, and one block uncovered a patch of a further underlying organic surface.      Work then moved to the removal of wall locus 15, which shrunk in section against the southern baulk, appearing only 2 courses high. It is therefore likely that the wall was terraced down slope to the north, or ran east to west with lower courses stepped down slope. This would explain the position of bricks in the west section tilting down slope compared to a straight horizontal orientation of the bricks in the south section.      At the end of the day the pieces of surface 21 were removed in boxes and foil, and were transported to the depot. Although this surface contained more debris than the other two white surfaces, the lack of household debris associated with it suggests a non-domestic context. These surfaces also seem to emerge from the east section but this needs to be checked.     ,~: A-8-2002-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 2,"778,2002-07-22," C-3-2002-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3/Locus 3056,","   C3 Daily , July 22, 2002   Today we looked at the SE portion again and decided that the locus, L3079, was fill. In the small window we cut in to that locus on the W edge we could see that we had missed the surface we were aiming for by leaving us about a centimeter or so above the surface. Realizing this, we decided to take L3079 down to the level of the surface. We also decided to take the remainder of L3080 out as well as the area N of L3080 which is L3057. We are taking these to loci down so that we can get down to the surfaces that are beneath them as well as get the entire trench relatively level before we start working on the W part of the trench.    Taking a look at the entire E portion of the trench we saw that the area was without any good surfaces, only a couple of broken degraded ones, and no architecture that is associated with surfaces. Therefore we are going to dig L3070 which is the W most locus of the E portion of the trench and boarders the W part of the trench which has not been dug yet. We will go down with handpicks in 50cm horizontal increments across the entire W side of the locus. We will dig in this manner in order to see any change that might be coming up and stop in time to preserve it.

I decided that in spite of his doubts, that L2128 is in fact an ash surface; in order to trace this surface back to the wall 2125/2126, I peeled back L2124 with a small pick and trowel, taking the locus down about 7cm. The soil of 2124 was mixed collapse debris with patches of softer and harder soil; the harder soil was mostly in the south-west part of L2124. After 2124 was removed, we sprayed the area and immediately saw a distinct color change in the soil at a straight-line seam, which indicates that we cut into L2125 about 12cm in the east and about 3cm in the west. We photographed this line of color change. With 2124 gone, the area extending from the north edge of 2125 to the 9m section cut seemed to be of the same color, texture and composition. I therefore changed to new locus 2133 in the area below 2124 + 2128. L2133 is dark brown with a few small patches of ash, no bigger than a teacup. The soil of 2133 runs directly up to wall 2125, very clearly abutting. While we were removing L2124, there were several bone and pot sherds, and I packaged the flat-lying body sherd in a separate KT bag (KT13). We photographed the joint between 2125 + 2133 and the section on 2125. L2125 is composed of alternating crumbly greenish bricks and harder reddish bricks and is positioned flush against L2126, oriented in a squarely East-West manner. Where 2125 meets the west baulk, an ash line that probably corresponded with 2128 rises from a lower elevation in the west baulk toward the 9m cut and then when this ash line wraps from the baulk into the wall, it stops abruptly about 7cm in at what appears to be a brick line. This abrupt stop is still confusing, as the wall appears to continue into the baulk, but this ash line appears to be independent of the top (preserved) course of 2125 and the courses below the ash line. Weird. We photographed.       When we sprayed L2133, I also sprayed the section cut at the 9m peg, and photographed the ash lines there. The top bit of ash of 2133 appears to be only an ash lens, and I scraped this with a trowel and saved 2L of the soil (basically the entire ash lens) for flotation. I did not switch locus, because the ash was clearly not a pit and because we had seen so many ash lenses in the upper elevations on this step, I decided to make note of the lens and continue with the locus as 2133. I had Davut cut down Locus 2133 with a small pick and sift every third buck of soil. I also personally watched for finds in this surface locus, using a small pick to break up larger chunks of soil which produced some interesting lithics (a large, red worked stone and a white quartz fire-starting stone). There were some bones, and a good number of diagnostic sherds. I had Davut preserve the wedge of 2125 that is at the same elevation as the top of 2133, so we can trace the depth of wall 2125.       I had Attila use a big pick to whack 20cm of L2131 in the east half of 2131 (having renamed the remaining portion of 2114 as 2131 because the soil appears to be of similar nature to 2131-western half, by looking at the section we created by digging 2131-west yesterday). After the east half of 2131 was the same elevation as 2131-west, we swept and trowelled looking for soil differences, brick lines, and texture changes. I outlined several bricks and brick fragments that I saw in plan. These were variously crumbly green bricks and harder red bricks, with some brown bricks that contained lots and lots of dense brown clay (as in raw material clay). There was also a large expanse of undifferentiated mudbricky material in the center that had no brick lines, but was of a different color and texture from the surrounding brick fragments. Looking at the south section and the east and west baulk, it appears that we are cutting through layers of a large brick wall, as clearly defined, multi-colored brick bands are preserved in section. In plan, however, there are at best randomly positioned bricks that make me think of a brick pavement rather than a wall. I like Andy_Ñés idea of a thick wall that does not necessarily have nicely organized brick rows, by way of making a _ÑÉdefensive wall_Ñé less susceptible of collapsing. For lack of a better way of defining this area of mudbrick material, I had Attila use a big pick to chop down the west portion of 2131 about 25cm, so that the section on the east half of 2131 is legible. At the base of the west part of 2131, after Attila had finished this task, I saw a color shift from brown brick to red brick, which may simply be another course of mudbricks in this deep area of wall/collapse or whatever it is. We swept up but the day ended before I could get an up close and personal look at this area. One important thing to note, however, is that L2131 on both east and west sides has produced very little occupational debris (sherds, lithics, bone).       By the way, yesterday when I had the workers cut down 2131-west half, I asked them to preserve the bricks visible just south of 2129, because I did not want to destroy the last bit of this band of mudbricks, if in fact it is a wall, and not just a band of preserved MB pavement. I decided today to give this short band of preserved bricks its own locus: 2132. I will look carefully tomorrow to determine if there are brick courses in 2132, meaning that we have a wall flush against 2126/2129 or if we have parts of a pavement on top of fill, or what!?       I am having some frustrations with elevations the past couple of days, but today, I rechecked several places and compared the results to depths I was able to measure with a tape measure against the baulk and 5m section cut and I think that as of today I now have accurate elevations. We have come down about 75cm at the south 5m cut, which is embarrassingly little, considering how much more soil we have to move in the 3 weeks left in A-2 for this season.      ,~: A-2-2002-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2114,"783,2002-07-23," C-1-2002-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1071,","   Daily Trench    Area C   Trench 1   July 23, 2002      I have been away from the trench for two days and feel a bit behind.

If nothing spectacular shows up in this part of the excavation they I will put one worker on L1083, which is the mudbrick architecture below L109, and the other worker on L1071, which is the possible wall foundation in the center of the trench. During the removal of L1082 in the northern corner a different type of pottery began to appear that is much more fine than that which is generally found here. Two pieces especially caught my attention, one was a small greenish fragment with incising and the other was a small rim shard of a particular shape with a beaded rim and a sharp turn in the body shape (cup-like). There was also an interesting hammerhead type rim that the top of the rim was slightly concave.      L1083 did not come up with much today. It is still the very dense and compact bricky material with little artifacts contained there. The mudbrick continues down and will be excavated to a further extent tomorrow.      L1071 was started with a 3x20cm slice taken out of the western step of the locus to get at fresh dirt linking the top level with the bottom where mudbrick seems to be present. Separate KTs will be assigned for the artifacts removed from this slice than those that will be removed from the top excavation. The dense pottery fill seems to rest on top of a similar mudbrick foundation as is found in L1083. Then I began by having Ibrahim take down the locus 3-4 cm from the south towards the north. This will get more dense in the north since that area is significantly higher than the southern area. After finishing approximately half of this locus a great deal of pottery was retrieved, mostly in at all angles, nothing flat lying suggesting a surface. Also this pottery is the usual kind for the most part for this area, none of the finer samples that were found in the NE corner. Mudbrick does appear under this layer of fill and will be explored more tomorrow.     ,~: C-1-2002-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1071,"784,2002-07-23," F-15-2002-07-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 15/Locus 2,","   KENAN TEPE   AREA F   TRENCH 13   July 23, 2002      We removed the last little bit of locus 7 and continued finding more cobblestones (locus 16) that extend the area of cobbles almost throughout the whole trench. These new cobbles help complete a very good surface at one depth or elevation and extend for almost the whole of the 1 by 9 meter trench. All of these cobblestones layers are very possibly of the same period, after a good cleaning and measuring I may go back and join them all as one locus. We still have locus 6 on the North end, which is also a cobble surface, but this one is found at a few centimeters higher than the others making it unlikely to determine their contemporaneity. The one single area in the trench that does not have cobbles is found immediately West of locus 5. This (locus 14) is an odd shaped area of fill that may have rested either to the side of a road and or wall, but those determinations have not been made sure. I think it is important to note the this area which does separate the two layers of cobble surfaces may be the best evidence that those cobbles are from different periods, and most definitely tells us that they must have had different uses.The cobbles at the bottom of the large half pit (locus 4) will now become locus 15, a determination I probably should have made earlier; but I want to make sure now that they be separated until we can finalize the case for making all of the cobbles as one locus.   Today we mostly worked on defining work that can help us make the determinations and changes enumerated above. Work was slow using mostly trowels except for a short while when we used hand picks in locus 14.

The other area of focus was trying to figure out the nature of structure 7053. We dug the probe next to the wall (L7052) another 10 or so cms. It appears as though the wall is only 1 course and that we are only cms. above where the surface would be located.      We also sectioned the northern wall of structure 7053 in a 25 cm. section.

The extent of this surface was less than expected, as it does not underlie locus 21, which is higher and to the east. A wall became visible later in the day, running from east to west against the southern baulk, consisting entirely of stones. The fill south of this wall (locus 33) will become locus 34. Fill under surface 21 became 32 but changed to 36 as soon as the stones became visible to the south and west. It was logical to keep the east as locus 36 and the west as locus 35,which underlies locus 30, because it seemed that the wall stones separated east from west and because the soils were slightly different. Both 35 and 36 however, have turned out to be sitting on the same wall 33, and loci were changed again to locus 37 to represent any debris lying on the stones.

We had left it there the day before basically because we didn_Ñét have time to get to it, so it was just a case of taking it down to the level of the dirt around it.      We also spent a large part of the morning troweling down the entire S half of L1078, the place where we had discovered some bricky material and also the new wall L1080. We troweled down just enough in the area to the east of the line to see if the wall continues or if it ends. We think that the wall does appear to continue farther down towards the E baulk, almost meeting up with L1069, another wall or pavement locus.

The horns of a bull figuring were recovered from later WNW pit L5085 (KT 5085.31).   The removal W-central rock concentration L5099 proceeded relatively uninterestingly. No unexpected finds were recovered and the area underneath the rocks simply appeared to be a heavy concentration of mudbrick collapse. The area underneath the rock concentration has been designated L5117.   The final thing worth mentioning is that we finally appear to have reached the conclusion of pit L5085. Late in the day we discovered what appears to be a multi-colored mudbrick paving or similar at the bottom of the pit.

We left those pedastalled and cut around them about 10cm extended that cut to the west baulk. As we were cutting down adjacent to the west baulk, we found a lot of white plaster looking stuff but was actually a reed impression similar to the early layers of reed impression in Trench A8. We slowly picked off the surface with trowels and found that we had very little of it and that it is not well preserved. We cleaned off the area, took a few samples for flotation and photoed. Once everything was clear we changed locus to L19, which is the reed impression itself, and L18 is the fill above the reed impression.       L19: The reed impression feature that starts about .43m from the south baulk and extends due north about 1.07m at the south have it dips downward then rises over a slope in the north. The fill on top of the impression, L18, is soft and ashy and we picked it off in chunks with a trowel. The positive side of the impression on L18 is much better preserved than the impression itself in L19. We took samples of these chunks in L18 for flotation.

The wall seems to be at least 2 meters wide and crosses the trench in an east to west direction. Excavation of locus 29 to the north has revealed that the wall is preserved only to one course. Locus 29 may represent a foundation trench associated with wall 33. No surfaces were detected in locus 17 to the north, suggesting that if a living surface existed it is probably located to the south behind the southern baulk. A Nineveh 5 shard found in locus 29 suggests that the wall is either third millennium or later.       Excavation of locus 34 showed that wall 33 is more northwest to southeast than simply east to west. This has formed a small triangle in the southwest corner of the trench where a possible surface may be located. Cutting a section in the western half of the wall may reveal this surface if we haven_Ñét already lost it as the foundation trench theory implies.      Locus 17 contained much mud brick debris and may represent the collapse of wall 33. In the late morning two stones emerged from beneath the wall in its southern section, which indicates that further courses are located further down and to the south. From above the most northerly row appears to straighten considerably in relation to the rest of the wall and runs parallel to the southern baulk. This raises the possibility that the northern row has shifted off its line and represents tumble.

As we have found these surfaces and taken their elevations we have found to be very close in elevation when compared with each other. This fact helps corroborate that all of these surfaces (L12, L15, L16) are from a contemporaneous period.    It now appears very likely that the pit (L 4) is of a later nature than the cobble surfaces, as we can show the cobbles at its base to show that it was dug to that level. I will close Locus 4, even though the ground signature still displays the outline of the pit but its walls and contents have been wholly removed. Remaining from it are the cobbles locus 15 and the hard cement like surface locus 9.    It also looks like locus 5 was cut through levels and much deeper than any of the cobble surfaces, but being that it is a rather small pit it does not detract a great deal from the cobble surfaces near it.

In the southern part of our current step, we dug a 1.3 x 0.5 m wide probe in the west half of 2131 in order to see if the white plaster line we see in plan is mortar or a surface. After taking this band of 2131 down about 15cm, we could see a section on the south baulk, the south edge of wall 2132 and the east portion of 2131. We saw that the white plaster line, stretching east-west 35cm from the south baulk, continues downward as mortar, not as a surface. The line seems to migrate slightly southwards as elevation decreases.      ,~: A-2-2002-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2/Locus 2126,"802,2002-07-24," A-10-2002-07-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 10/Locus 8,","   Area A   Trench 10   July 24, 2002      Hasip and I excavated about 30cm in the northern half of the trench today (L10). We exposed L11, the sandy, rocky matrix that sits in the western baulk, extending about 65cm east into the trench. Part of L11 was found beneath L10 (which we finished excavating today) and the rest of it was found beneath L12. We only excavated the parts of L12 that were above L11.      L10 was a silty soil, less compact than L12. It consisted of fill and was dug as a sounding level. L10 ended up about 55cm deep. This is a bit deeper than I intended to dig the sounding level. Regardless, there were no soil changes.       We also finished digging L8 today. L8 is believed to be a collapsed stove in the SE corner of the trench. We have found mud brick in the interior of the stove, making me believe that the stove has collapsed into itself. There were two distinct types of mud brick. The outer walls were made of a compact, red mud brick. On the interior, lining the outer walls, there was a more crumply, white mud brick. I took samples of both. The very inner core of L8 contained a fair amount of very loose, silty soil. I did not find any carbon samples in this locus.

I can see also that neither the new surface, nor the surface of L3070 continues in the S portion of the locus. The S part looks like fill both in section and above.

After the decision to expand the trench to the East in the baulks nearest the North end our hopes were to continue expanding the cobble surfaces to reveal their extend, and to perhaps locate a continuation to the large cobbles part of locus 2 that may also reveal their purpose, is it a wall, marker, fence, etc. We just don_Ñét have enough of it to tell us its purpose or reason why it was build.

At the same time I created the removal locus L2147, which describes the removal of the mudbrick platform L2142.    Started to excavate L2147, and after 1 hour of excavation, it dawned upon me that I had forgot to take plan photos of this feature. After a quick discussion it was agreed that I should take a number of normal photos as replacement for the plan photo.   The pottery (C.2.2147.1) seems to be a mixture of late 2.mil. and 3.mil., maybe there are some transitional forms and ware types (ask Lynn).

I also saw to removing the pedestalled area of L5087 and L5107, which were remnants of central area surrounding grain feature L5095 and on the S of pit L5085. They had been left standing to help maintain a good context break between the two very different periods found in the contexts on either side, but the prospect of people running around and tripping on them during the baulk reduction didn_Ñét seem very desirable, so I had them removed. It was something that needed to be done in the near future anyhow, as we finally appear to be reaching the end of both contexts.   The remainder of the day was spent directly preparing for the baulk reduction. All major potsherds were pulled. Sandbags were partially filled and placed to completely cover the grain surface and support the walls of the mudbrick structure and the exposed W wall of oven L5111.

We thought like that because there is a row of rocks standing there just like a line and that made me think about it a bit more. The rocks had the same locus number with the surface L4077, so this means that L4065 and L4077 are more or less the same. To make this clear we have articulated both surfaces today and now I think that the two locia are the same, they are equal to each other. L4065 will remain the same locus number that is has right now, but the locus number of L4077 will be changed, even tough they seem to have the same context I can say that L4077_Ñés context is more packed in.

I am waiting on their excavation until 1085 is finished and other separate loci are uncovered from this locus. These pits are rounded rectangles, a strange shape for pits. These two both run roughly north to south. They may simply be strangely delineated groupings of mud brick.

The thin topsoil layer is followed by a darker brown clayish soil that is fine in composition, and is soft for digging. The top layers are darker in color, becoming lighter as their excavation continues. These two layers are part of the overburden layer turned over by mechanical plows probably over the last 100 years. This is probably the reason they are not so compacted and are soft for digging. These top two layers yielded very little pottery or bone.   Below these top layers the soil gets somewhat lighter and is more loam quality and has a fine composition. It is still soft for digging and few pot sherds were recovered. This new locus is number 19 and extends for about 0.30 meters. The lighter soil color is possibly due to a decrease in organically decayed material, in essence, older soil that has lost those nutrients or which long ago were used up.   Our intention while excavating the trench extension was two fold, first reach the level of the large cobbles and see if they are part of a wall or retention wall of some sort. When excavating locus 2 it looked like some care had been employed in the making of whatever this was a part of. Second, reach the cobble surface known as locus 6 and see if this extends as a surface, or some kind of a walkway.

We also cleared the debri to the N of L14 but did not find any substantial additional structure.       We also removed the support buffers L21, 22, and 23, leaving only small supports for stability. Under l22 we found foundation stones connecting to wall L10 and extending under most of the back of the furnace (we are not yet able to view everything). L17 does continue under L23 and abuts L20.       We came down in L5 finding more mud brick debri and much slag (KTs 40, 42). We left a buffer around the \white line\ however, and did not learn much more about its nature. We also continued down in L29, finding and articulating more mud brick debri and 1 piece of slag (KT 63) to the north. Continuation in L31 revealed some pottery and debri, but nothing concrete.      Finally we emptied and cleaned the main chamber of L14, finding lots of slag in the debri pile to the north (KTs 25, 26, 27).

It was the west baulk of D5 and it was the east baulk of D4 (for 3m). The reason for taking it down is to protect the trench and to avoid any accidences that may happen during excavating. The workers have also used trench D4 during this process. But D4 kept on to the excavation. We started from the north of the trench with loica 4067 and 4069, and just by articulating it for them for 3cm we have seen that the context of these two locia turned out to be the same, so for this reasin they two have the same locus number right now that is 4082, and it abuts the sounding D3 at the east side and the old pit known to be 4028 and partially it abuts L4065 (the surface that is sealed).       Besides excavating on the north side of the trench I have also excavated the south side of the trench. We have articulated L4077 and we have found out that the floor 4065 and the previous locus 4077 that is now 4083 has close context with L4065 and the wall 4081, is in two parts as if there is a doorway and that these rocks are the boundary line for it. So, more or less we are done with the west side of the trench. But the thing that I am wondering about is the drill in L4083 (it was also in L4077), how deep is it and what is it, I think that the mystery will be solved in a few days.      So my aim for the next day is to take out the floor that has got the locus number as 4065 out and try to observe what is waiting for us next. Then I am planning to make the levels of L4079 and L4065 more or less the same.

This was followed by the removal of a subsequent lower reed surface 30 to the west. This revealed the top of stonewall foundations, locus 33, which runs from northwest to southeast. Locus 29, though to be part of a separate mud brick wall appears to belong to slump associated with the superstructure of wall 33. Alternately it represents fill deposited later against the wall. Both wall 33 and locus 29 produced third millennium pottery. Likewise locus 17, composed of mud brick debris may reflect mud brick debris associated with the superstructure.      The white surface may now be considered as wet courses in the wall rather than use surfaces, which are lacking domestic or any other assemblages. Fills 23, 26 and 28 to the north, yielded harder fills, otherwise preserving their dimensions. A potential mud brick wall seems to separate fill 23 and 26 lower, which have been renamed 39 and 41 respectively. Locus 28, underlying 17 has become 39 whilst 29 has become 40.

With a few extra workers on hand, we pushed the W baulk back a meter for about 1.5 meters of vertical space from the surface.

Excavation therefore resumed in fill loci 38, 39, 40 and 41 to establish the depth of the wall. The western half of the trench was nominated again for the purpose of catching any foundation trench or surface associated with the wall. Substantial mud brick slump was found beneath loci 41 and 38 associated with mud brick slump dividing loci 39 from 41.       The western section shows mud bricks deposited on an angle following the trajectory of the slope. This supports the notion that the northern fill loci belong to a collapsed wall superstructure. The problem with this theory is that the reed surfaces protrude beyond the line of wall 33 above it, casting suspicion on the idea that is all one and the same wall entity. Wall collapse from wall 33 in very clear in the eastern section and the reed surfaces extend past the collapse and above it.

A grindstone (KT35), a pestle (KT34), a hammer stone (KT38), three pieces pottery (possible weight, KT33), some nice vessels pieces (KT36), two pieces something (I am not sure what they are, they look like brick, KT37) were found on the south part of L8 (2.5m from south baulk through the north) with some bones and potsherds. And also there were some bones and potsherds on the north part of L8. Especially, after digging we found a broken pot with a bone in it (569.67) on the north part of L8, they still stay on here. The photograph of them was taken. On the middle-east part of L8, there is a piece of bone (we do not know yet is it a piece of a human body or not).

Also we used the whisk broom to see if we could find any lines to go with the mudbrick we are finding in the NE portion of the trench, about 2m S of the N baulk and 50 cm to a meter w of the East baulk. We find that there are at least 4 mudbricks and we are looking for more. As of right now the mudbricks do not continue. The dirt E of the mudbrick is mixed with loose, soft dirt and hard, compact mudbrick. It feels like fill above something. We troweled the area E of the mudbrick a couple of cm and it looks as though there might be a cobble surface coming up. We have gotten the area relatively flat + a few cm here or there. We can see that any surfaces we have are discontinuous and definitely not related to the mudbrick wall that I am labeling L3083.

We started finding mud brick, a bit more concentrated in the eastern half of the locus than the western half. Hence, we dug somewhat slowly with the hopes that we would discover a feature or a wall.       In the Southeast corner, part of what appears to be a stove has begun to emerge. I named this locus 8 and I named the pit that cuts into it locus 5. Locus 5 contained non-thermal, loose, silty soil. It only goes 8cm deep into locus 8. At the bottom of the pit I found more mud brick, which suggests that the stove collapsed into itself.       Locus 7 (like L4 and previous loci) covers the entire 2x2 except the SE corner where L8 is located. We_Ñére still exposing L8.

It contained compact silty soil mixed with quite a bit of mudbrick. L12 started revealing small amounts of reed impressions. I changed to new locus 13 when we realized that there was a large layer of the white reed impressions running across the sounding. L13 not only provided the reed impressions but we also found a layer of ash, and we managed to exhume a carbon sample.

We had started the week with some high hopes for the wall that has been very elusive in this trench since its starting date! Thus we had sectioned off an area (L 18) that we thought had very good possibilities as a wall, but as the work progressed we removed that and left only a short portion of it sticking off of the East baulk. This small section is kept because it seems associated to baulk signatures consistent with those of a wall. The ash layer as explained in the daily  is extensive and may have been associated with this wall or laid there by act of man or nature. If by man it could have been a disposing place of ash for some industrial purpose. The possibility also exists that the wind blew it against it. Associations between these two features seem unlikely and it would appear that the ash is much older than the wall. It is possible that virgin soil was dumped over the ash before a new phase of construction. But this seems to me unlikely, most local people would have seen the ash as an unstable surface in which to build. It is more likely that the ash was dumped there from some industrial or cooking facility!. But one would guess that it is an inordinate amount of ash either way. There is a possible relation to the pit (L 14) but at this point is difficult to stretch it to that effect.    In all likelihood the area of the trench represents an area of work with multiple activities at work, this can be most certainly ascertained by the ash of L 16, the cooking pit L 14, the burned bricks which may be a decaying large oven (L 20) and perhaps even the rocks of L 13.               ,~: F-13-2002-07-29-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 13,"850,2002-07-29," C-1-2002-07-029-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 5   Area C   Trench 1   July 29, 2002      In this final week of excavation, I wrapped up work for this season in C1. Right now it seems that everything is coming up mudbrick. Beginning with the northeast, L1092 has continued down for two courses to become a low wall or possible windbreak. There are two courses of stone, each laid on a layer of pot shards. Just to the south of this area I found at least two vessels broken in situ (KT 1094,12 and 1094.13). To the south again is an other area of 1087 collapse or surface. It is unclear at this time if this locus continues down.      Three was also an interesting fire installation 1074 that continued down. This was found directly between the two white flagstones of 1075. There was a round depression with a great deal of broken pottery as lining, including a possibly early bronze age pedestal base. This continued down to more ash and burnt stones (L1097) and L1098 which may have been an oven base. 1098 is a u-shaped mudbrick platform that continues down below the current level of excavation.      Three strange pits or features have appeared in the southern section of the trench (L1086, L1088, and an unnumbered area). They are rounded rectangles in shape and appear to be composed of layers of mudbrick followed by very compact dirt followed by more mudbrick. Each layer of mudbrick is formed of two separate bricks, one to the north and one to the south. Their purpose is unclear.      Lastly this week I worked at articulating the western side of 1089 mudbrick wall and the possibly associated mudbrick surface of 1101. By removing 1096, this process was begun. On the last day, 1096 was removed except for a section in the southwest corner. A number of flat lying pot shards were recovered from this locus and beneath seems to be another mudbrick surface.     ,~: C-1-2002-07-029-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1,"851,2002-07-29," C-2-2002-07-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2133,","   07/29/2002   C2   Daily       Started the day by cleaning and taking photos.   Opened a new locus L2154, this locus was created for two purposes in mind, one so we might get rid of the two small pits L2123 and L2124, by leveling them out. The other purpose was to get the western section of L2143. Created three KT-bags for the usual find groups, pottery (C.2.2154.1), lithics (C.2.2154.2) and bone (C.2.2154.3). But apart from these categories, we also uncovered a carbon sample (C.2.2154.4), a somewhat flat fragment of basalt (C.2.2154.5), some pieces of possible metal slag (C.2.2154.6 &amp; 7) and finally a sample of some clay that have been burnt secondarily (C.2.2154.8).   Opened a new locus L2155 to get a section between the two pits, L2128/L2153 and L2141/L2149 in the southeast corner of the trench. Opened three KT-bags for the excavation of this locus L2155, pottery (C.2.2155.1), lithics (C.2.2155.2) and bone (C.2.2155.3).    The excavation of L2155 showed that there was no apparent connection between the two pits, L2128/L2153 and L2141/L2149, in question.   Seeing this L2155 was closed and the excavation of L2153 was continued. The finds from L2153 was labeled as follows: Pottery (C.2.2153.4), Lithics (C.2.2153.5), bone (C.2.2153.6) and a carbon sample (C.2.2153.7).   As excavation of L2153 continued, we began to expand L2144 northwards, though leaving all definable mudbrick untouched. Opened three KT-bags for this, carbon samples (C.2.2144.20, 24, 25), pottery (C.2.2144.21), lithics (C.2.2144.22) and bone (C.2.2144.23).

We have found two small finds today, but we were not able to get their elevations. One is a basalt fish net weight that came out from part II, and the other one seems to be worked stone that came out from part III. Then we have excavated the L4082and L4083 at the same time; I think that I will change their locia numbers tomorrow. The reason for this is that the context is changing. For instance L4082 isn_Ñét a dirt fill any more, especially the south west corner of the locus; here we are able to see that there are some small rocks showing up. So, tomorrow I will be articulating this locus at least fro 2- 3cm more to see if it will be wall or not.      Besides this, I have taken out a considerable amount of dirt from L4079 out (this locus is located at the east side of the trench and it is still sub topsoil), at least for 10cm, so that it will be the same level with L4065. As I have mentioned it before I am at sub topsoil in L4079, and I am sure that the context of this era will change in 15cm. On the other hand I have articulated L4083 as far as I can, because I didn_Ñét want to destroy the laying surfaces. We have taken out three backets of dirt out, the result for this is very beautiful because a nice surface will show up. This new surface might be equal as L4065.

On the burial area; smashed cranium was exposed, as well as a few arm long bones and some rib fragments. Skeleton appeared to be lying in a flexed position on its right side, with the head facing east, because cranium appeared in very north end of this 1m wide trench. The inventory for L7 was those 3 thoracic vertebras, multiple rib fragments, humerus, radius, ulna, clavicle, scapula, single hand phalanx and skull. Burial was definitely detached at waist and no other bones were in sight. Both arms, shoulders / rib fragments and 3 vertebrae were removed; only skull and single phalanx remained.    The east part of the trench (1x7.5m) was dug approximately 70cm as L8. In fact, on this area there were L2, L4 and the east part of L6 (1x2m) but we could not see any differences between them so we changed the number as L8. This area was dug because we wanted to see the section on the east baulk to understand is there any relationship with the other trench, F7 (the east of F14). L8 was rich about pottery and bones and its south part was also rich about brick.    L6 (2x3m; the middle part of the trench) was also dug 20cm to understand is there any similarity between L6 and L8 about surface and texture.

There seems to be a color change about 1m north of the S baulk coming out of the E baulk. It is only about 20 cm wide and does not connect with anything. This could just be a different fill inside fill. We are digging the entire E side of the trench level with the W side of the trench so L3081 and L3084. We are digging L3084 to the mudbrick wall L3083 and L 3081 to the baulk. We find that in the middle of L3081, under it, there is a large ashy area, possibly an ash pit. Also in 3081 there is a mudbrick coming out of the S baulk. It may be part of wall L3083. There is ash and red dirt coming up N of the mudbrick so I believe there is an ash pit coming up there.

For information control I kept the same loci numbers that we had for the 2 x 2 cut and used the stratigraphic signatures of those same loci to guide us.   By the time we reached locus 20 we began unearthing some rocks near the middle part of this new meter extension, we switched from large picks to smaller hand picks and continued slowly and with care.    The rock formation encountered consists of four large rocks one of which is a conglomerate rock that looks like cement; stacked in a line and which perhaps could be stretched to say that they could be part of locus 2. Again we are not able to make cohesive overall connections due to getting only portions of what these features may be part of. I labeled this formation locus 21 as again I am unsure of its connection with locus 2. As the areas close to this rock formation were removed we found a small continuation of the cobbles into the South baulk, it looks like the cobbles are diminishing as we follow them. We also located a hard surface that runs directly South along the East baulk of the 1 by 9 meter trench and in a direct South line from locus 2 but interrupted by the cobbles, this cobble interruption could have function as a doorway into the house with its extensive cobble surface. It is early to make these determinations and we will postpone them for after a bit more excavating.           ,~: F-15-2002-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 15/Locus 2,"857,2002-07-30," D-4-2002-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4065,","   Daily    Area D   Trench 4   July 30, 2002      Today we started to the day by taking the elevations of yesterday. Then we have taken out L4082 ( that was the first surface that we have faced at the north west side of the trench). Now we are able to see that the rocks; actually the wall with the locus 4084 do not touch the floor; 4085 ( the second surface in the same area; that was used to be L4082). L4084 came out from the west baulk of the sounding D3, and they are being cut by the pit that still remains in the trench since last season; it was L4028.      Then we began to excavate L4079; that is on the east of the trench, and I have to mention that only a considerable part of it has the same context with L4086. The interesting thing is the south east corner of the trench, because it is still hard dirt; as I have mentioned it before it is still sub topsoil ( the reason for this is being at the slope and excavating a bit slow because of facing too many surfaces after surfaces).      Besides this we have articulated L4083, and during our articulation we have taken out the drain pipe out. It looks like a Late Assyrian drain- pipe, but I am not sure of it. On the other hand I have taken the small finds out; two of them are from L4065 and their KT# is 84 and 85, then we have worked stone from L4079 and its KT# is 6, then the last two till breakfast were from L4083 ( the first surface at the north west side of the trench) their KT# are 5 and 6. At the end of the day we have taken the drain- pipe out and I have labeled as a small find that comes from L4083 and has the KT# as 7.      I hope that tomorrow I will be able to take out L4086 and L4087 more or less 15cm down, and I think that I need to lift up the rocks (the wall) of L4081 off.     ,~: D-4-2002-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4065,"858,2002-07-30," D-6-2002-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 1,","   Trench D6 Daily July 30, 2002         We continued down in furnace chambers L24 and L26 (two of the 3 smaller slag filled ones). In each we found an ~8 cm thick layer of grayish brown soil over a ~5 cm layer of rich brown material (all soil collected). Under the brown material was a rough layer of orange yellow hard bricky material, at which level we stopped excavating. We came across some mudbricks and debri, and cleaned and photoed the floaters before removing them. We found a few sherds of pottery, some medium sized round rocks, and a couple of pieces of slag (loose).      Across the Eastern part of our trench we removed all topsoil, closing L1 (at last) and creating 3 steps. Our purposes were twofold- the detail work in the L20 complex is so tight and slow that more than two cannot work at once, also we wanted a preview of the sections we would be later coming down on. In addition to this, the debri to the East of L20 seems to continue (probably tumbling with the slope) and we want to reach it_Ñés terminus in order to better understand the destruction/abandonment/collapse.       We found lots of artifacts in this debri, including a small figurine of a donkey(?), a fishnet weight, obsidian blade, a nice grindstone, a large hollowed out rock and lots of pottery etc. We also came across several groupings of large rocks.      ,~: D-6-2002-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 1,"859,2002-07-30," F-1-2002-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1057,","   Daily Trench    Area F   Trench 1   July 30, 2002      Work began this morning by digging down in L1083, a rather large loci made up of fill lying N of the new wall locus 1080. 1083 is made up of mudbricky fill, similar to just about everything in the last thirty centimeters or so in that occasionally you can make out a brick but most of the time you can_Ñét see much more than hard clumps on the sharp side of your pick-axe. We decided to try to go down in this area 5 cm at a time, cleaning up and then seeing what we had. We did this for quite a while. We went down five cm in the entire locus and another 5 in half of the locus before we changed plans. We did find a pedestal base, which is a nice pottery diagnostic sherd, in the first KT bag of this locus. This seems like a significant find in my trench this year, although apparently Katie and Marco pull out 3 or 4 a day, but I am down about two meters lower than they are, so it is totally different.      We also ended locus 1073. This was one of our walls, which turned into pavements as it was put into context. We dug through this pavement and the dirt underneath it, L1084, and had the whole area level with the rest of the trench. We did notice a distinct line near the E baulk which we left as part of L1072. If we don_Ñét see anything exciting about this area we have left we will chop this down tomorrow.      One other exciting development is that we have decided to end the vicious cycle of 5 cm and spray to try to understand this trench. We are pulling out the big pick axes and we will chop down until we hit something interesting.

We got a majority of the walls taken down on Sunday, but we had a few more cms to go. At first it appeared as though the wall was deeper on the south side than the north side. The soil looked red. In order to see if it was a real continuation, we cleaned and sprayed. It turned out that it did not continue, the color difference was a result of the contrast between old dirt and newly excavated dirt, so I closed L7053.      I also went around the trench and collected the various pedestaled items while the quadrant system was still in use. Mainly I collected a large potsherd, a doorpost, a weight and some bones.      We also opened a lot of new loci today. We have finished using the quadrant system, so the new loci reflect the end of the context we were working with. I opened L7080, 7081, 7082, 7083, 7084, 7085, 7086, 7087, 7088, 7089, and 7090. The fill loci that were arbitrarily assigned were 7081, 7083, 7089 and 7090. The fill loci that were assigned because they were at a higher elevation were 7080, 7082 and 7088. There is a human burial that was assigned as L7084 and the fill around it is L7085. There were some pits: L7086 and L7087.      I wanted to get the trench down to the same elevation, so we worked on fill loci 7080, 7082 and 7088.

Loci excavated in the oven today include: L5121, L5122, L5124 and L5125. Nothing particularly remarkable is coming out of the oven. There has been a lot of good carbon samples, as expected, plus an assortment of pottery, lithics and the occasional bone.

And also, on the cross of the east baulk, we saw the same structure and on L6 the plaster lines were continuing, especially on the south of L6, there was a plaster line like a wall line. For this reason, we began to dig the south of L6 (the south-east of L1; 2x2). We took off the topsoil as L1 and then changed the locus number as L9 because we arrived different kind of texture, silt loam.

About L8, only 56x45cm area (on the middle-east part of L8), which was not taken last day, was taken off.

We are trying to get the entire trench flat so that we can start working in the W half of the trench which, at this point hasn_Ñét been touched other than a cleaning scrape of the off season wash. We started by taking everything down to the level of the highest locus in the W half of the trench, L3081. We could see that there were maybe a couple of poor, broken surfaces in the biggest fill locus, L3070, but they were discontinuous and there is no architecture in the area for them to be associated with, so they won_Ñét give us much information about the trench so we are not creating new loci for them and digging the entire S portion of the trench as one locus. While digging we found the area to be rich in carbon and slag samples, which is normal for this part of the trench. We also found out that some of the pottery in the NW portion of the E part of the trench, L3082, is Early Iron. This might mean that in this locus we hadn_Ñét gotten down to the 2nd millennium, ore that there was a mix in this locus for some reason or another.   After taking off L3070 and L3082 bringing the area level with L3081, we found that we had uncovered a two important features. One is a large ash pit, L3085, and the other is a mudbrick wall, L3083. The mudbrick has definite mortar lines and is either 2 bricks wide or has very large 1m+ bricks. We also found what might be perpendicular mudbrick wall on both the N and the S sides of the wall. This could make this a structure if those are actually walls. Unfortunately we will have to wait until next week to find out as we found these at the end of the week.     ,~: C-3-2002-07-030-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 3,"867,2002-07-30," A-4-2002-07-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4/Locus 4020,","    Entry   7/30/2002      Took plan photos of L4029 and continued to clean up and remove the bone.

On the western border of this locus more of the small mudbrick as of 1087 was found. The two gray courses of brick match up in an inverted level with those of 1087 (the new area is basically a flipped over version of 1087). There are also harder areas of possible mudbrick at the surface of this locus.      1097 _ÑÐ This is the ashy layer in front of the possible oven base 1098. Two soil samples were taken.

As the first task was reached I switched gears and decided instead to take another meter South to continue to look for cobbles and to have a better understanding concerning locus 21. But in any case the surface of cobbles (L 6) appears to be getting narrower as they go into the baulk and out of sight.    Again we kept the same loci numbers as per stratigraphy from the 2 by 2 cut and collected accordingly. In this endeavor our floating East baulk suffered somewhat but we managed to get to the point where more rocks may start showing up. The hard surface in the baulk continues but it needs to be looked at more carefully.   One other interesting thing to note is the apparent look of bricks in the very NE corner of the open part of the trench.

I went ahead and began tracing out 4034 burial during the late morning. A rodent has caused some disturbance in the fill, but not too bad. Also discovered some animal bone fragments in or around the burial fill, including a large long-bone shaft that may be related to the skull removed from 4028 several days ago.      Came out in the afternoon and removed 4032 to make room to follow 4034.

After talking with Rick, plant to start on 4034 and then begin removing 4020 remaining in the SE part of the A4 trench.

A solitary stone has turned up in locus 45 at the same level as green mud brick slump against the west section next to wall 33. This may signal an approaching surface.      The revised strategy is to level loci 42 and 45, remove wall 33 west in order to sample the sealed mud brick deposits beneath the stones. Locus 45 is producing metal, bone and obsidian, as did loci 29 and 40 above it. Section cleaning in the west has shown a clear rubble/debris line on a slope at the seam between loci 42 and 45.      The mud brick slump at the base of locus 45 seems to be sealing a surface containing ash deposits and pottery. Locus 42 is being taken down to uncover and articulate more of the surface, which will become locus 46.      The mud brick slump seems to be forming a wall line, which arcs northwards from east to west. Locus 46 will therefore become the south side of this slump/wall whilst locus 47 will become the north side. Locus 47 is filled with pebbles, which are lodged in the earth, and cannot be saved or cleaned in situ, as with a regular surface.      Future excavations will focus on defining this pebble surface as well as the extent and character of locus 46.     ,~: A-8-2002-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8/Locus 33,"880,2002-08-01," A-4-2002-08-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4/Locus 4020,","    Entry   8/1/2002      Rick and Donnell finished with 4029 burial.

There was also a need to remove the stones from the wall in order to take care of surfaces 46 and 47. However, the need to draw the western section precluded the removal of the mud brick locus 48 due to the extreme height of the section.

Excavations revealed that locus 47 overlies locus 46 in the north as the latter migrates beneath the mud brick slump. Locus 46 is defined by extensive ash deposits and seems to underlie wall 33. Locus 47 consists of small pebbles particularly concentrated in the north-west of the current work area mixed with clumpy earth, substantial pottery and some bone. It was not possible to define this locus as a surface and it seems that these pebbles represent a natural deposit or an exterior slope wash. Locus 46 contained even more pottery, bone and interestingly, obsidian. A number of very good carbon samples were taken from locus 46.      Work concluded with the flattening of loci 46 and 47.

Our aim was simple; lower the trench while maintaining material control and wall control. The Western half of the trench exhibits a couple of interesting features, one is the rocks in the SW corner described yesterday, and the other is the possible wall we are beginning to articulate. This \wall\ was located by observing, and following semi-straight lines of white pebbles fairly evenly perpendicular to each other. This is something that next year_Ñés season should strive to better identify.    The Eastern half of the trench has a curious arrangement of rocks and pottery. This at first looked liked a pot smash but as we worked on it, it began to look more like a pot stand. There were several small pieces of pottery and some rocks simulating the shape of a pot or dish. The medium cobbles on the bottom appeared to give the arrangement stability while the smaller interior cobbles and potsherds seemed to have given it an even surface. A curious note about this arrangement is that the interior of it was filled with coarse sand that was collected and saved as KT # 4 on locus # 6. The sherds were collected as one unit and saved as KT # 3.    A note to make is that if the markings do reveal a wall, those materials collected as KT #s 3 and 4 may need to be separated as coming from within or without the wall.             ,~: F-17-2002-08-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 17/Locus 4,"890,2002-08-04," D-6-2002-08-04-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6,","   Trench D6 Weekly Summary #4&gt;through August 4, 2002         July 27-August 4      This week was mainly concerned with exposing the rest of D6, and exposing the debri that slumped from the L20 kiln complex (L20, L14, L6, L5). To accomplish this we created 3 new steps (for a total of 4), both to make room for further excavation and to expose sections for analysis. We found many stone groupings in the East, lots of artifacts (including a figurine and a fish net weight) and evidence of another surface. We also found a possible wall in the South East (L33), although we are not sure of its associations and it is well out into the eroded area.      As we were accomplishing this we continued down throughout the area of L20, with the technique of cleaning and removing debri 1 layer at a time, after photographs and discussion. We came down about 20 cm in L20 (about 15 cm below the associated surface L17) before hitting first dark ashy soil and then a layer of orange mudbricky type material. At this level the slag finally stopped (actually a centimeter or two before), but when we cleared debri from the front of the arm between chambers L24 and 25 we found a large river of slag wrapping around and under a  ossbeam\ mudbrick. As we were clearing we also attempted to ascertain the actual dimensions of the kiln, and removed much of the suspect and small floating debri that was pedestalled as if part of the original structure. It seems the 4 inner arms are shorter than the outer, and that perhaps the two larger chambers, L25 and 27, while similar, are differently designed.      We also continued in the area of L14 chamber, finding a large amount (~3 kilos) of slag debri among the mudbricks just to the South and East of L20. The debri was not consolidated and did not have any evident pattern, but was randomly strewn.      Finally, our goal of finding the drain to L20 might finally be in reach.

For third 10cm; its locus number was L13 because when we were digging L12 we arrive the different kind of texture, compact loam, so its locus number was changed as L13.

Following the baulk reduction, we focused on two things primarily this week. The first was the continued following of the Ubaid context as far as possible into the pit-dominated North. This was done with success up to the areas of clearly extant partially or unexcavated pits. However, in the NW is looks as though we have finally gotten through the huge plaster-lined pit which dominated that region. The current focus in that portion of the trench is the connection between the Ubaid contexts and the skeleton.    he skeleton\ is a human skeleton we uncovered mid-week. It is in a peculiar position, possibly on its knees, face down with its arms behind its back or at its sides. Not a common burial position. This leaves us with the question of, if it isn_Ñét a burial is it someone tossed to the bottom of a pit or, if we_Ñére below the pits, is it someone who got caught in the same Ubaid collapse with caught all the grain and fabric to preserve it so well. We hope to answer these questions in the coming week.   The other area of focus was the large E-central oven. Other than its size, the primary remarkable feature of the oven is that it contains some interior architecture_ÑÓa semi-circle of mudbrick with extreme concentrations of ash within. The current theory is that this is a firebox of some sort. The other feature of the oven is that by cutting a section into its wall this week we found no foundation between the grain surface and the oven proper, suggesting it is either contemporary with or predates the grain surface.   Also of note is that we uncovered a foundation trench for last season_Ñés house-attached SE oven and it is founded higher than the other but appears to be contemporary, something which, combined with the grade of the grain surface, indicates the construction may be on a natural slope.        ,~: D-5-2002(S) (4) from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"897,2002-08-05," C-2-2002-08-05-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,","C-2-2002   08/05/2002   Final Summary    Area C Trench 2      Trench C2 was started in the 2000 season at Kenan Tepe and the excavation in trench continued in 2001. In 2001 the excavation was concentrated on dealing with a number of surfaces and their relation to the walls present in the trench.   The trench was prior to this season excavated to a depth between 596.56 and 595.97. That is roughly 2m below the topsoil.       The first problem that faced us, was the lay out of the trench, as it was done in 2000 with out the use of a total station, and therefore the trench was not laid out accordingly to the established grid, and because of the lack of precise measuring device the trench has a slightly crocked. All this were considered when we re-stringed the trench, where we stringed the actual trench and not the conceptual trench (the square that it should have been).    A note about the excavation technique, all the excavation in C2 this year was done with small pick and trowel, because I knew that we had to be careful because we would be searching for surfaces and mud brick architecture, things that will disappear when you are using the \buyuk kazma\.    The south baulk was in a poor condition, because it had collapsed and cut back. Therefore it was cleaned and straightened on several occasions. The following loci were use in the process: L2127, L2129, L2137 and L2152.   The actual excavation started the 07/04/2002, where we started a locus L2103 in the western part of the trench. The purpose of this locus was to clean the dried dirt away, so that we would have a fresh surface to work from. The next couple of days went with cleaning the different areas of the trench, although this cleaning went on as we excavated different parts of the trench later in the season.    On of the main structures in the trench was the wall foundation L2116, a foundation of stones, that had earlier supported a mud brick structure, that had removed during the last couple of seasons. The foundation wall L2116 stretched a long the north baulk and then turned south, almost to the south baulk. Abutting this wall L2116, was another foundation wall L2117, this wall was only one row of stones. L2117 abutted L2116 south end and ran towards the SE corner of the trench, where it hit the south baulk. Be fore the removal of both foundation walls, they had been cleaned (L2104 and L2105).   L2116 was removed in sections, because it seemed to be resting on different areas. The south part of the wall L2116 was removed as L2108, as it was built on top of a surface identified in 2001, as L2099 ( L2145 this year). Among the stones removed in L2108, were there two basalt grinding stones (C.2.2108.1&amp;6), which had been reused as building materials. The next part of the wall L2116, was removed as L2114, it was the last part of the north-south running part of the wall L2116. In this part the wall seemed to better built than in the part that was covered by L2108. While excavating L2114, we did not find any ground stone in the mix of stones that was L2116. The last part of the wall L2116, which almost ran parallel to the north baulk, was removed as L2119.    The other wall L2117, was removed as L2120, where we found that southern end of this foundation wall L2117 was sloping and therefore had an extra course of stone. The wall it self had only one row of stones. With the two walls (L2116 and L2117) gone, we investigated the sub-wall fill. The fill L2121 under L2117 seemed to indicate that the wall was floating on dirt or fill. While the fill L2115 under the wall L2116, gave way to a mud brick wall L2143.    The area under L2115, L2119 and towards the west baulk was cleaned as L2122. Already we knew from previous excavations that there were two small pits L2123 and L2124, present here. But as we cleaned the area around these two small pits we saw lines radiating out from the two pits. These lines were what was left of trapezoid mud brick, forming circular patterns around the pits L2123 and L2124. This feature was labeled L2142. Along the northeastern edge of L2142 we encountered an area of soft darker dirt, this pit was labeled L2125. When it was excavated it consisted mostly of animal burrows.   The two small pits L2124 and L2123, in the center of L2142, were both capped by a hard plaster \lid\ or top. The reason why they are mentioned together is that when they were excavated, every feature in one of them was reproduce in the other. They are both thermal pits, lined with potsherds, the dirt in them are heavily burnt. They are of same depth 22 cm.   What this feature, that consist of L2123, L2124 and L2142, plus maybe the wall L2143, function or meaning is, is still good question. The fact that the pits and mud brick seems to so well organized can indicate that the pits were not dug into the feature but rather a part of the construction. Function ? I can only guess, but since both pits had marks after burning, the function might have something to do with heating or fire.   The platform was excavated in vertical slices L2147 and L2154, which removed the mud brick.   On the eastern side of L2116 there was a large area where they last year excavated a large surface, pits and other disturbances. With the cleaning of this area, locus L2103, it was given a fresh start. Very early I could see that along the east baulk there was a disturbance L2106, this was separated from the rest of the area L2107. When we had excavated and cleaned the area that was L2106, it became clear that it was not one disturbance, but a number of features along the east baulk. Along the north part of the east baulk there was mud brick wall, L2134. Further south we had an area of light gray soil L2112.   When we had excavated about 10cm of L2112, it became clear that there was two distinct different areas. The first of these L2128, was identified as a pit and a continuation of an earlier defined pit, which now dominates the south end of the east baulk. The other area L2118 was more interesting as it had a rusty-red soil color. L2118 functioned as a cleaning locus for this area. After cleaning it, it was divided into two, at time I thought distinct, loci L2141 and L2149. This was done because of a bright red-rusty line dividing two dark, ashy and moist areas. A thing to notice is that it took almost 4 days for this area, L2141/L2149 to dry. After excavation of the two loci, L2141 and L2149, and seeing that they had a bottom in common, they were equalized because of this. The bottom of these two loci, was excavated as L2160.   During one of cleanings of the south baulk, L2152, we removed some stones and found a feature, that looked like an oven feature, L2158, sitting in the baulk, in the south east corner of the trench. L2158 was extended towards the east baulk and continued downwards. It became clear that the features excavated as L2141, L2149, L2158 and L2160. Was in fact the same one, a thermal installation of some sort. The soil from L2158, in particular, had a high concentration of ash and charcoal. All four loci was sample for floatation.   The pit L2128, that was located almost next to the feature, just described, had sub division excavated as L2153. The fill in which L2128/L2153 was cut in to, was excavated first as L2132. In L2132 we saw mud brick coming out everywhere, especially along the north baulk, labeled L2133, but also single mud brick, apparently floating. This made me change locus to L2144.    This areas southern border was where the wall L2117 stood, it was removed as L2120 and the sub wall fill was labeled L2121. The wall L2117 was associated to a surface L2099, relabeled L2145, excavated last year on the south side of the wall, it was so that the surface, L2138/L2145 sloped up against the fill under the foundation wall L2121 and the foundation wall L2117.   The part of the surface L2145, that was under the wall L2116, removed as L2108, was cleaned as L2136. The surface was removed as L2146.    Under the surface L2145 we uncovered a mudbrick wall L2156, which ha d a preserved thin white plaster line on the south side. The wall L2156 runs from the southern end of the west baulk to the western end of the south baulk. The wall consists of 1.5 mudbrick, with the half being the plastered one. I put in a locus L2157 that would give a section of two the walls present in the trench, L2143 and L2156.       One good thing about the fill, dirt and other material excavated from the trench this year have had charcoal in them, so we should have a good opportunity to get some decent dating from some of the loci excavated. The pottery excavated has so far indicated that it is middle bronze age (MBA), circa 1800 BC, material we are digging. Though some of the potsherds, so far this is an unconfirmed rumor, from under the mudbrick platform (L2142), that is loci L2147 and L2154, might be earlier.   The architecture excavated in the trench this season is mostly plain mudbrick or mudbrick-on-stone-foundation architecture, which unfortunately is not preserved in larger blocks, like shapes of rooms.      Again unfortunately there is a lot of lose ends in the trench. As we were ending the excavation in L2157 we came down upon some pebbles and potsherds, that to me looked like they could be lying on top of a surface, that might belong to the north side of the wall L2156.    With regard to L2153, we did seem to get to a clear bottom of that pit, so it will have to wait. As well will the wall L2143, as the stone foundation seems to better preserved than the mudbrick covering it, and therefore continues further south than the mudbrick.        ,~dc-terms:title: C-2-2002-08-05-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,"898,2002-08-05," D-6-2002-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 4,","   Trench D6 Daily August 05, 2002         Today we began in L15 (the rock garden in the SW) removing the 1st layer of large stones. We saved these stones to the side in case of further need. Under these we found a ~5cm thick layer of dense smaller rocks and pottery, which we took a picture of before removing. Under this we found that surface L17 continued as expected.      Next we began to remove surface L17. Athough we did not complete removal today, what we removed was consistently a ~8 cm deep mixture of small (under 4cm) stones and pottery. We noticed that the matrix of this surface was soft to the East but became very hard as we moved west. In this we found a carbon sample, and took a soil sample for flotation.      While we were working in the South (L15, 17) we continued to push down in L29, finding rich red bricks and soil (10YR 6/8 reddish yellow). Removing this allowed us to see that furnace/line/wall L5 continues all the way to L14, and blocks the entire East of L20. This \wall\ contains slag and also presents stop for the west side of L35 (the strange conglomerate heap, which we examined today and found to be very soft- not a candidate for drainage from L20). Today we also remeasured our B dayplan and corrected the errors (esp. in the west, L30, 31,35) and expanded L29 to the East.      Finally of note, we removed the strange rock with the hole in it (L4.96, turned out to be a mortar) and a large well used grinding stone (L4.96).s     ,~: D-6-2002-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 4,"899,2002-08-05," A-4-2002-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4/Locus 4020,","    Plan   08/05/02      Sketched in plan view of trench as seen at opening. Took opening elevations. Note that soft area of dirt labeled a continuation of 4031 is definitely more visible early in the morning.      The hard, mud-brickl type fill seems to continue fairly uniformly along the south margin of the trench. Hard to make much of it at present. Could bea melted feature such as a wall, but it may have also extended farther north and been more uniform. Can_Ñét tell now since burials and bioturbation have churned that area up. There was also that large amount of oven fill in the NE portion of the 2x4m block we_Ñére now working in (4037, 4020, 4039, etc.).      On to the \cyst tomb\. Removed the large surface rock of 4013 and the smaller rock immediately north. Revealed an underlying surface of hard packed dirt. This dirt formed a layer 2-3cm thick that peeled off an underlying surface quite easily. Part of the underlying surface is another large rock. Other material may be formed mud brick. At the very least, these are areas of smooth, compact, and somewhat homogenous dirt. Hard, but not too hard.      After removing the large flagstone or capstone, I cleaned out a fair sized area of fill associated with 4040. Exposed what looks to be one definite mud-brick and nearby fill that may be bricks or decomposed brick fill. Also exposed several courses of stone and another very large, flat piece of rock only slightly smaller than the one previously removed. Although there may still be a burial under this, it looks very much like an architectural feature and may well be the NW extension of some feature running into 4037. I say this only based on the current amount of rock debris currently exposed in that area.     ,~: A-4-2002-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4/Locus 4020,"900,2002-08-05," D-4-2002-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4083,","   Daily    Area D   Trench 4   August 5, 2002      We started to clean and to take out four locia at the same time. In L4083 and L4085 I was able to pick up some 3rd millennium ceramic pieces. I am trying to come to the same level with the mud brick payment (L4088) that is located at the southwestern portion of the trench. Then I have picked up the rocks on L4083; I don_Ñét have them on the day plan for the 1st of August, because these rocks came out during articulation and they were not set on the locus. So, I say that I haven_Ñét given them a seperat locus number, they have the same locus number with the debris that is 4083.      The reason why we are taking L4086 and L4087 at the same level with L4088 is to see if they have a connection or not. On the other hand we have excavated L4083; we started to articulate this locus from the south to the north. Our aim is to see if the mud brick payment is going under the debris or not. During this process we have found four ceramic small finds. I think that three of them belong to the 3rd millennium as I have mentioned above, and the fourth one is a basalt fish net weight.      The articulation of L4083 was between 3- 5cm, and during the articulation process we have found a new group of rocks. These rocks are running from the south to the north and then they are making a turning point to the west (it is not clear but it might be into the baulk). The rocks will have a seperat locus number tomorrow and it will be 4089.      I have taken the closing elevations for the locia that I have worked on today, but I will open the new locia tomorrow.

When we watered the baulks and faces of locus, we saw that, on the east baulk there were 3 brick sections and plaster lines. The top plaster line looked like falling through the south. On the cross of the east baulk, there were the same sections and on L16 (the middle part of the trench) one plaster line continuing through the west straightly. To see that, is this line the part of a wall or not, we dug the south of it through to take same level with L16. When we were digging this area the topsoil was taken the new locus number, L1; the second level was L9 (silt loam); the third level (compact loam area) was taken the number 10, L10; and finally we arrived the same level with L6. On this level, we saw that there were disorganized plasters (on the south part of the trench, on the face of L10) but it could not help us to understand is this a wall or not. And also between L6 and L10, there were 4 huge rocks as close with each other (between 6.10m from the north baulk and 2.20m from the south baulk; and also between 1.65m from the west baulk and 1.80m from the east baulk: 34x25cm; 32x19cm; 35x26cm; 42x15cm).     To understand that, were 3 brick sections and plaster lines on the east baulk continuing through the east or not we widened the trench (2x2m; it is beginning 1m from the south baulk and continuing 2m through the north and 2m through the east). This area was firstly dug 10cm as L11 (topsoil), secondly dug 20cm as L12 (silt loam) and we found some rocks on it, and finally dug 10cm as L13 (compact loam).      ,~: F-14-2002-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 14/Locus 1,"902,2002-08-05," G-6-2002-08-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 6,","   Trench G6   August 5, 2002   Daily       Karran continued the work of excavating the burial.

The trench is near other trenches in the same area of F, to the Northeast is F7 being excavated by Katie Smith; to the East is F9 which was excavated last year by Downell Moon. A bit South and East of my trench is F1 being excavated by Chris Moon. West of F 13 are F 15, F 16, and F 17 which I also excavated this season. F 14 _ÑÐone of the new trenches- is located immediately North of F 13 and is being excavated by Nergiz Nazlar.   Area F is located on the lower town of Kenan Tepe on a cliff above a bend of the famed Tigris (Dicle) river near the town of Bismil in Eastern Anatolia. As the cradle of civilization, this area of Mesopotamia is rich in archaeological deposits of rich historical contexts. Our purpose in this trench and in this area has been to enlarge our understanding of activities that took place in this part of the tepe. F 13 was one of a number of trenches excavated and/or that will be excavated in an effort to locate work and/or living areas, interpret activities from the cultural remains found, and, identify the time and the spread of habitation.   To begin, we cleared all of the thorny bushes and other vegetation from the 10x10 trench and marked off the one meter that was to be excavated. Interesting to note that the thorny bushes produce a small berry which children from nearby villages pick for some income during their summer vacation off school. Locus 1 which included the first 0.05 meters of topsoil had a beginning elevation ranging from 570.82 meters on the Northwest corner to 570.44 meters on the Southeast corner. This 0.38 meters difference in elevations within such a short distance is due not only to the natural down sloping of the area towards the Tigris River, but also to long abandoned plowing furrows. My guess is that cotton or some type of winter wheat was grown in this area of the tepe. I would also guess that the field was left fallow then later abandoned some 10 years ago. Mechanized plowing may have had a lot to do with the low quantities of pottery and other cultural remains found in this trench. A trend that I believe holds for most of the trenches in area F.   Removal of locus 1 also included the sub-topsoil layer, which was followed by a deep layer of a darker soil with a lot more organically decayed content (locus 2). When locus 3 was removed the soil used for Munselling must have came from one of the reddish soil deposits that began at about 0.60 meters because when I marked the baulk the color just didn_Ñét look the same to me. By locus 4 we started to encounter the white pebble material characteristic of virgin soil (as observed in F 4). I found myself theorizing about the origin and purpose for the white speckled soil and whether it might have had a special purpose or reason for appearing where it does. My early theory was that anyone moving or re-depositing virgin soil from one area to another must have had a good reason for undertaking such a labor. One might wonder rather safely that there was a purpose contained in the use of this soil. One would question that if the white speckled soil is virgin soil, why was it moved, or what was it used for? One guess that arises as part of its composition is that the white chalky pebbles contained as part of it may be components in brick making or brick laying! perhaps it was used in plastering or coloring of the bricks. With that idea in mind I found myself directing excavations in those areas that exhibited the white pebbles in the hopes that they would point towards walls and/or other features. It is noteworthy to mention two kinds of white pebble. One is a hard and feels more like a pebble would. The other is more like a chalk-clay and can be turned into a powdery material easily. This latter one could have been used as a plastering medium. Both types have similar white coloration, also vary in shape, and are found in abundance in certain layers. The harder pebbles are more abundant.   After excavating the fill in locus 5, we encountered a mass of medium sized river cobbles (locus 6) followed by a surface (locus 7) on which lots of pottery was located, both of these were near the North end of the trench. Due to the small area of these loci and the lack of other contexts it was difficult to make associations or even interpolations of the certainty and usage (if any) of these two loci. We had also hoped to intercept a wall feature observed in the West section of F 9 after we cleaned it on my first day of excavating. That feature showing four courses of bricks was clearly indicated in the baulk but its direction was not so clear, our aim had been to dig down on F 13 until the wall was intercepted and then worked on its interpretation. But we either cut through it or its signature was all too difficult to identify at the time of excavation. As I have looked at the baulk in the last days of excavating, the signature of bricks is still hard to see, more visible on the East baulk of F 13 are a couple of mortar lines, and a reddish square close in line to where the bricks are located in F 9. Careful removal of the baulk between F 13 and F 9 will provide next year_Ñés excavator with a better picture of the extent and direction of those bricks. Near the middle of the trench and next to the East baulk we followed a wall pattern that showed about a 0.20-meter wide, wall like pattern of about 0.24 meters from and almost perpendicular to the East baulk. This became locus 9. We removed that formation but no wall was evident to us.    The first really interesting feature encountered was a huge layer of ash located at about 0.90 meters in depth. This layer (locus 8) is also a feature which Dawnell Moon had to contend with in F 9. As the excavation of the trench progressed this layer extended through a large area (see final plan) with some deeper parts than others. This layer of ash seems pretty well compacted and noticeably darker than the soil next to it. This ash layer also lacks the white pebbly stuff found earlier in the excavation. This is interesting because the layer being too long to be a pit might indicate an area of refuse, yet why didn_Ñét it become commingled with the white pebble soil? Was the ash layer deposited all too quickly through an intense fire to have avoided \contamination\? Is the ash_Ñés provenience from a workshop or kiln setting? How large is it? It is fine and dark. Why was it deposited here? And by whom? The direction that the ash takes may help indicate that it was leaning against something like a wall or that it would have followed a road, or a natural bend or depression in the topography. The walls which perhaps we missed, may have served as a natural break or place where the ash just came to rest. If this was the case the wall idea seems like a very good possibility. If there was no wall, what concentrated it over such a large area? Until provenience and associations can be made and found for this feature more questions than answers will continue to plague us.    Other features worth mentioning are the arrangement of rocks (locus 13) found while excavating the fill in locus 10. This feature exposed 4 large rocks organized in a semicircle with some smaller rocks and cobbles in the middle. It appears to have been used as a pot-stand. Unfortunately the majority of what may complete a circle is beyond the exposed wall.    In an effort to have a better look at emerging walls or features, and especially waning to look at locus 9 in section we decided to open the trench towards the West. It is hard enough to look at a section when all you have is about 0.50 meters of area to look from. The decision was to cut a 3 (North to South) by 1.50 (East to West) meters beginning two meters from the South baulk. The contents of layers similar to those on the original 1 by 9 meter trench were collected separately an can be related to each other for the following loci: 12 with 3, and 15 with 4.    This cut provided us with two important loci, both of them pits. The first one (locus 11) was a small shallow pit that was likely associated with the locus 2 level. The pit provided some bone and was quickly disposed off. There were no structures associated with it. Locus 14 is the larger pit from which we also extracted bones and pottery. All of the soil from both of these pits was sifted after collecting two 2-liter samples of soil for archaeobotany studies.   The pit (L14) with an almost symmetrical circumference appeared to me to have been more carefully planned than other pits, after carefully excavating down to its top (initial) level we can associate it with some of the adjoining features. First of all, it appears that the white plastered surface was surrounding the pit for at least its Eastern half. This plastering would point to a specialized function for this pit such as that of storage but many bones were recovered from it, not to mention all of the ash. Most people wouldn_Ñét plaster a cooking pit unless its presentation was important to others, such as in an open market setting where presentation was important to others. Plaster was not located for the Western half of the pit up to this point, but it may be found one or two centimeters below the current surface L 12 or maybe even L 10. Elevations are similar between this pit the oven remains (L 20) and the remaining piece of wall (L 18). If this can be better established we may be able to make the association that would place all of these features as contemporary with each other. The function may have been _ÑÐas mentioned above- that of an open market setting where edible goods were made and sold. Loci 8 and 16 the ash layers may also have a contiguous association to the pit and the other features. Obviously since the oven (L 20) appears to sit on the L 19 surface, the surface may be a continuation of the surface in which the pit (L 14) was dug into.   Next year_Ñés excavation can strive to answer a number of the questions raised in this summary. A better definition of walls needs to be ascertained so that all of the other pieces can be better related to each other. Also in need of an answer (a difficult one until more of the trench or the adjoining areas are excavated) is the provenience of the ash. The size and usage of the pit and the oven may go a long way in also helping to answer some of the questions.     ë_ë_     ,~dc-terms:title: F-13-2002-08-06-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 13,"904,2002-08-06," D-5-2002-08-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5080,","   Daily Trench Summary   Area D   Trench 5   August 6, 2002      With the assistance of bone specialist Andrew we are now beginning to uncover the human remains in the far NW of the trench. This is going slower than hoped, however, due to large amounts of animal bones in the area and the generally strange positioning of the skeleton and is tendency to flake away with the slightest pressure, especially in the skull area. However, things are slowly proceeding and we may be able to get it mostly articulated for the planned plan shot on Thursday.   The rest of the focus in the trench has been on the NE large ash pit L5116 which is turning out to be bigger and deeper than I originally imagined. However, as the ash is more concentrated near E-central oven L5111 and we never really found said oven_Ñés northern wall, I believe the pit actually cut the oven and part of the extreme ashy area is actually ash pulled out from the oven itself. The pottery in the oven, on preliminary examination, appears to date it to the 3rd millennium and/or Late Chalcolithic.   Finally we worked on the central plaster-lined pit L5122, which, contrarily, turned out to be smaller and shallower than expected. As it expected it was cut in the E by pit L5116.   Plans for tomorrow are to remove the edge of pit L5116 to flatten the area out to below the level of the bottom of the plaster-lined pit and attempt to find a continuation of the more southerly Ubaid surfaces. Hopefully we_Ñéll uncover these and be able to sufficiently uncover them for good use in the plan shot. If not, it may have to be postponed a day.

Specifically this relates to the increasingly clean contexts encountered in loci closer to the center of the mound, and relatively mixed contexts in loci further down slope, or in the case of A8 to the north. This tendency was exacerbated because of the deep sequence of walls, which were reached immediately below sub-topsoil up against the southern baulk. The position of the trench, which lies entirely north in relation to the walls, meant that loci to the north of the wall sequence were always mixed and fill-like, whilst cleaner contexts were left unexcavated in the baulk of A2 to the south. The terracing of the mound in ancient times further emphasized the lack of clean contexts, since spill lines, predominantly consisting of wall collapse from the wall sequences, continued for several meters down slope. The latter are visible clearly in the east and west sections of the trench. In summary, greatest attention was directed towards the southern extreme of the trench, where the wall sequences were encountered.      The excavation of the wall loci _ÑÐ principally defined by loci 5, 15, 18 and 33 - in the southern extreme of the trench was subject to a number of problems stemming for incorrect interpretations. The orientation of the first wall sequence, locus 5 was not clear, but it seemed to run from south to north on the western side of the trench. A gray fill to the east briefly interrupted a generally brick-like area, which continued to the east as loci 3 and 11. The gray area was subsequently recognized as pitting activity, cutting the wall, which extends into the eastern baulk, hence running more from east to west.       The next sequence of mud brick architecture was encountered almost 1 meter down, and was excavated as locus 15. However, the feeling that the end of wall 5 was indeed reached, and that wall 15 represented a distinct sequence was again based on erroneously interpreted information. Loci 12 and 14 lie between walls 5 and 15, and are characterized by the impressions left from decomposing organic material, principally in the form of river reeds. These white surface-like deposits were initially interpreted as living surfaces, even though suspicion over the paucity of artifacts within their matrix was raised early. Further such surfaces were encountered beneath wall 15 as loci 21 and 30, the latter resting over the third and final wall sequence: stonewall 33.       Both walls 5 and 15 consist of mud brick, which alternates between green, brown, red, yellow and gray in color. However their orientation is still questionable since mud brick is clearly seen in the southern section for wall 5, whilst wall 15 largely disappears in the southern section, compared to the greater number of courses encountered further to the north and in the west section. This fact raises the possibility that wall 15 ran slightly diagonal to the trench, and is hence distinct from wall 5.       The white organic deposits were subsequently reinterpreted as wet courses in the wall construction. However their relationship to the wall sequences is unclear. It is clear for instance that the white deposits do not align with the walls entirely, nor do they cover any of the wall sequences entirely either. Locus 12 lies below wall 5 but does not extend as far as the wall. Locus 14 likewise does not align directly below wall 15. The same is true of loci 21 and 30 in relation to wall 33. Furthermore these organic deposits do not overlie one another but are positioned in a staggered fashion so that one occurs higher and to the side of a subsequent lower deposit. The existence of these deposits as wet courses in the construction may explain the hiatus of mud brick between walls 5 and 15, and may reinforce the notion that these two sequences of mud brick indeed belong to the same wall.      The hypothesis of one continuous wall was extended to include the final wall sequence, locus 33. However a number of problems rest in this interpretation, which includes wall 33 as the stone foundations of the mud brick superstructure represented by walls 5 and 15. Objections to the hypothesis of one wall come in the form of three strains of evidence:      The position of the organic deposits    The fill above, to the north, and below the stone courses    The nature and content of the brick collapse, and spill lines to the north          Taking the first argument, we notice that the white organic loci 30, 21 and 14 all extend well beyond the northern limit of the stone rows of wall 33. In addition, the obvious collapse of wall 33, easily visible in the eastern section, lies beneath loci 21 and 14. This scenario indicates that either these deposits were laid after the collapse of wall 33, or that they have moved with the collapsing structure. The latter seems very unlikely given the almost perfectly horizontal position of the organic layers.      The second argument raises the problem that the fill below, to the north, and above wall 33 is the same. This fill is composed of a dense, extremely hard-packed, clay-like deposit rich in bones. The fill was excavated as locus 29 above the stonewall, locus 40 at the level of the stonewall, and locus 45 below the stonewall. The only reasonable explanation for this is that natural fills were deposited over time against the standing wall 33. After the collapse of the wall, these fills continued to gather, depositing against and above the collapse; indeed the line of these deposits follows the slope line. Finally, in a rebuilding of the wall, reed surfaces were used to lay down foundational wet courses. This idea is strengthened by the discovery of mud bricks in the southern section at the level of wall 33 but not above it (see below).      The third argument concerns the evidence in the eastern and western sections. The western section in particular shows three clear spill lines. The upper line comprises the topsoil and sub-topsoil of later mixed fills excavated as locus 2. The second line comprises mud brick debris relating to the first wall sequence excavated as loci 17, 23, 27, 28, 29, 38 and 39. The third clear line showing a pebble spill surface on a slope with deteriorated mud bricks above it, relate possibly to the earliest wall with stone foundations, which was excavated as loci 38, 39, 40 and 41. The lower, hard-packed surface represents the loci described above excavated as 42 and 45. These spill lines link up well with individual sequences in the walls with their own separate episodes of collapse. At this stage all these wall sequences seem to date to the third millennium.      Stonewall 33 merits further description. Stonewall 33 itself follows a northwest to southeast orientation. The one-meter wall foundations, which rise, at least 7 courses in places, do not contain an associated foundation trench, and extend only 1 meter in width. This wall seems to be broadened by mud bricks, which extend into the southern baulk. It is therefore impossible to estimate the width of the wall other than to say that it is broader than 1.5 meters. In addition, no clear living surfaces can be associated with this wall. It is reasonable to speculate that associated surfaces are to be found to the south, in the baulk of A2. The stonewall was built on a north-south slope, but its construction suggests that a further east-west slope existed in ancient times. A course of stone and a mud brick foundation underlies the wall only in the west part of the wall, which raises questions over the orientation of the slope. The absence of stones in the spill line associated with the collapse suggests that the superstructure of this wall was composed of mud brick.      Beneath the mud brick foundation placed only on the western half of the trench, a uniform hard-packed brown earth was encountered, which seemed identical to the fill beside the wall to the north, and immediately below the wall to the east. The fill to the north quickly yielded debris with mud brick slump and pebbles, marked as loci 46 and 47. Locus 46 in particular was defined by a series of ash lenses containing substantial pottery. The excavation of the mud brick foundation below wall 33 found the same ash deposits as locus 46, but the former were much more abundant and clearly striated, interspersed with a series of brown fill layers. These sequences contained good carbon samples, as well as bone, lithics and pottery. The ash under the wall excavated as locus 49 and produced a rare stone seal on the last day of excavations. These deposits predate the foundation of wall 33 and represent potentially the first clear surface deposits in the trench. The remaining loci to the north represent topsoils, sub-topsoils, and wall debris. A broken, cobblestone surface _ÑÐ locus 44 - was discovered in the far north of the trench, but this was ephemeral, and lacking in good diagnostic artifacts.      Trench A8 therefore represents the remains of a long sequence of wall construction and rebuilding episodes, largely dated to the third millennium, but which lacks associated surfaces. The final days of the excavation reached the end of the wall sequence and found surfaces not associated with any architecture.\t           "",~dc-terms:title"": ""A-8-2002-08-07-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8"","913,2002-08-07," F-15-2002-08-07-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 15,","F-15-2002   FINAL TRENCH SUMMARY   Area F   Trench 15   Aug 7, 2002         F 15 was laid out as a 10 meter by 10 meter square trench with intersects also laid at the 5 meter mark, this year_Ñés excavation began as a 1 meter by 9 meter on the Western most one meter of the trench.

To begin we cleared all of the thorny bushes and other vegetation from the 10x10 trench and marked off the one meter that was to be excavated. Locus 1 which included the first 0.05 meters of topsoil and subtopsoil below had a beginning elevation ranging from 571.53 meters on the North end of the trench to 571.38 meters on the South end. This small difference in elevations is due more to the natural down sloping of the area towards the Tigris River, than by the long abandoned plowing furrows common to this area, as F 15 is a lot flatter than other trenches nearby. My guess is that cotton or some type of winter wheat was grown in this area of the tepe. I would also guess that the field was left fallow then later abandoned some 10 years ago. Mechanized plowing may have had a lot to do with the low quantities of pottery and other cultural remains found in this trench. A trend that I believe holds for most of the trenches in area F.   Removal of locus 1 included the top-soil and sub-topsoil layers down to about the first 0.40 meters. As we continue excavating we encountered some rocks which became locus 2. These rocks were arranged in what appeared to be courses with about 3 courses to the formation. I quickly theorized that this could be the beginning (or ending) of a wall that had been carefully laid. Our problem with this feature as we articulated it was that very little of it was included in the 1 meter wide trench. As removal of it was undertaken a thin layer of plaster was noticed between the rocks, an agent probably used in binding them together. Removal was taken down to a fairly large rock at its base and left at that point until we expanded the trench East along the North baulk and discovered that the rocks had another course next to where the other had been and that it added another 0.40 meters to the extend of the locus, we did not remove this second set of courses but left it to use as a guide when expansion of new trenches to the North was started. Unfortunately the rocks did not continue East but stopped after these second \column\ or course of rocks.    As excavation continued Locus 4 and 5 both pits were discovered, followed by a medium cobblestone layers (locus 6, and loci 12, 15, 16 which were later joined as one under locus 17) at two distinct levels that as we dug down became the most important features in the trench.    After the fill in locus 3 and 7 was removed we encountered a portion of a pit (locus 4) protruding from off of the West baulk, its size is estimated at about 1.28 meters in diameter which makes it a large pit, but again most of its Eastern half was in the baulk and beyond. As the pit was excavated we discovered two interesting features about it one was a lining of cobble at its bottom, which was later added to the cobble surfaces, The other interesting feature was a band of a very hard clayish material, this is also lost into the baulk and can_Ñét be determined as to purpose or provenience. Both of the pits the larger L4 and the smaller irregular L5 were soil sampled for archaeobotanical analysis and sifted in their entirety.    The large surface of cobblestones grew as loci were removed and came to extend throughout most of the trench. When we expanded a meter to the East, and 2 meters to the South from off of the North baulk and later as we added a meter extension twice they again expanded as those additional separate cuts were added towards the South.    At this point we can surmise the following, the cobbles of locus 6 appeared at first (and may still) to have been part of a road or surface that came off of the Northwest corner of the trench wound its way between two possible structures (L 2 and L 5) and continued on a Southeasterly direction. Locus 21 which may be a piece of a wall (was left for now) may have also sat to the West of this road of cobbles. These cobbles constitute one level, the other is a more extensive surface extending for about 6.5 meters of the original 1 meter trench. These layer of cobbles we believe is part of a courtyard surface covered with cobbles. Pit L 4 must have been cut through a later layer (L 7) and stopped when the layer of cobbles of locus 17 was reached. I believe that the other pit L 5 was dug on the side of the road or surface L 6 and is probably contemporary with it.   One thing to keep in mind, and is evident by comparing depths on the day plan is that there is a difference of about 0.25 meters between the two. As locus 6 is excavated we may find that the cobbles of l 17 may also extend underneath.   At closing we located in the Northeast corner of the trench a row of bricks comprised of 3 courses with some of the white material between them as if in a layer of mortar between each brick. These are small bricks and will need to be looked at more thoroughly next year. No locus number was assigned to the bricks this year. One other area that does not have a locus number is the about 2 meter long by 0.25 wide meter feature resembling a wall and part of the original East baulk of the 9 by 1 meter trench.

Pebble deposits further characterize locus 47 whilst locus 46 is distinct for its substantial ash pockets. As the excavation continued locus 46 migrated north to subsume locus 47.      The excavation of locus 48 uncovered the continuation of locus 46 to the south beneath the wall. Indeed the ash deposits become more regular beneath the wall and extend into the southern baulk. These deposits became locus 49 and were excavated by peeling each distinct and successive ash deposit, which are separated from one another by interspersing layers of brown fill. These deposits are taken to represent an earlier sequence than the wall, and may be associated with surfaces or oven dumping. Locus 49 produced substantial diagnostic pottery, carbon 14 samples, and lithic debitage. Importantly, a red stone, dice-like seal was recovered on the final afternoon.        ,~: A-8-2002-08-07-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 8,"916,2002-08-07," F-7-2002-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7079,","   Trench F7   August 7, 2002   Daily       We began by sectioning feature L 7094 into east and west halves. We took down the east half 5cm. We are trying to expose and remove some of the large pottery pieces that are still there. The western half of the feature has some areas of more hard packed earth. The soil type in the center of the feature is somewhat hard to identify as it has been chewed up by root trails. One section of the eastern half looks as if it could be a small remnant of a hard packed earth surface. I have not yet given it a new locus. I_Ñéd like to examine it further. We are screening all the dirt that comes out of the area.   I also munselled the south baulk. It has 3 definite layers which are very easy to define. We will be drawing baulks today so this will make the task easier.   We also found out that 1 bucket of dirt  8 liters. This will help with the ratios and things when they_Ñére extrapolating stuff about screening.   We pushed down 10cm in the eastern half of L 7094 We removed the pottery after taking numerous photos. The piece previously though to be a lid was actually part of a broken pedestal base.   We then began to push down on the western half. We left the area of the possible surface intact. We found a hard clay area of chunky dirt that could be brick. It looks like the burned mudbrick found by the southern end of wall L7073.   The small possible surface was determined to not be a surface by Cengis who then hacked it out while I was away.     ,~: F-7-2002-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7079,"917,2002-08-07," F-14-2002-08-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 14/Locus 1,","   AREA: F TRENCH: 14   AUG 7, 2002    Aug 6, 2002; L16 (the N-E part of the trench; 6x2m) was dug 1x2m from the north to the south.

In addition to this, on the south-west part of L16, there was a vase neck with some rocks (this vase neck looks like the jar piece which was found on F7; the east of F14). L16 was really rich about pottery (4 full bags).    We wondered about is this wall continuing through the east or not.

Area F is on the lower mound at Kenan Tepe that dates from the Chalcolithic to the Early Bronze Age. This area is characterized by a lot of ovens, ash, and was significantly lacking any material remains or structures that implied a domestic use. F7 is the only 10x10 meter trench currently being excavated in this area. Therefore, this trench gives us the opportunity to catch a large area in one context and get the horizontal picture of this lower mound.    This is the second year that F7 was excavated. We went down about 1 meter last year in the western half of the trench and about _ a meter in the eastern part of the trench due to a natural slope. This year we continued to go down in elevation about 20-30 centimeters in the western half of the trench and about 15 to 25 centimeters in the eastern half of the trench.   The trenches surrounding F7 include F5(?) to the East, F8 to the Southeast, and F9 to the South. None of these trenches were excavated this season. F13 lies to the Southwest and F14 lies to the West. Both of these trenches were excavated and had some structures in them, namely a possible mudbrick wall in F13 and a cobble surface in F14. (I believe). Neither of these trenches seemed to have a direct relation to what was going on in my trench.    At the beginning of the season, the main goal that we had in place was to determine the nature of and the relationships that existed to a 3 sided mudbrick structure in the center of F7 and hopefully push on through to the next context. We were able to accomplish this goal this season.       Excavation          We needed to clean the baulks, so Loci 7060, 7061, 7062 and 7063 were opened to collect the debris from the 4 baulks in the trench. After cleaning the baulks we were ready to begin cleaning the debris left from last year and taking care of loci that were unexcavated.    There were 2 surfaces left over from the 2001 field season, L7047 and L7049. L7047 had been pedastled, so it was a priority to articulate the cobbles that it consisted of, photo it, take samples from it, and take down the elevation. We took a 10 Liter soil sample from the surface for a chemical microanalysis. After taking down the surface we opened fill locus 7048. It was a cleaning locus in the northeastern part of the trench that abutted cleaning fill locus 7046. We took down elevation in fill 7046 in order to articulate surface 7049 and then opened another fill locus 7056. After taking down elevation in this fill, we found another surface directly to the east of surface 7049. I opened locus 7059 for this surface. This surface was cut by pit 7050 that was also located in the northern half of the trench. Pit 7050, surface 7049 and surface 7059 were all photographed with the spider so that they could be accurately portrayed in a measured top plan that we did during the season. After shooting the photographs, we excavated these surfaces much like surface 7047: articulation, chemical microanalysis, and removal. After excavating surface 7059 there appeared another surface underneath it, perhaps a subfloor. It was excavated in the same manner and a 10L soil sample was taken from it as well. However, L7079 was not completely excavated this year before the season ended. There is a small area of concentrated cobbles that is part of this surface.    Pit 7050 was excavated at the same time as pit 7051 that was located in the center of the eastern half of the trench. They were both large and circular in shape and started out as fairly soft. However, in both cases during excavation, after about 10 cms the soil changed and become more hard and clayey. In the bottom of pit 7050 there were a lot of flat-lying pottery sherds and animal bones. In pit 7051, we were not sure if we had reached the bottom, so we sectioned it and the new half of the pit we were digging deeper became pit section 7058. We continued digging this for about 20 cms. After analyzing the section it was clear that we had excavated the entire pit. Both pits, 7050 and 7051, turned out to be quite shallow and although I noticed the change in soil in both and changed their KT bags, so we would be sure to have an uncontaminated sample, I did not take elevations when the transition occurred.    The next related loci to talk about are all related to a 3-sided structure that was in the middle of F7. This mudbrick structure was slightly more red in color and had a much more course texture than the surrounding fill. The borders of the structure were clear in soft light, and it had very definite boundaries. This structure was L7053. There was a wall probe that was left over from the previous year that I opened as L7052. Before we had reached the related surface, we opened loci 7056 and 7057 as cleaning loci. Fill 7056 represented the fill on the exterior part of the structure and fill 7057 represented interior fill. There was also a human burial directly east of where the southern wall seemed to end and we were not sure if the wall actually ended or if it was cut by this burial. The burial itself was L7054 and the burial fill was L7055. In an attempt to get a better idea about structure 7053, we opened fill L7064 to the east of the southern wall to see if we could find any wall extensions. We did not. Once we had determined what our situation was, we were able to start excavating the fill and figure out the nature of this structure.    In order to have as much control as possible on the material remains and soil samples we took from this area, we instituted a grid system for excavation that extended over the entire trench. The grid was laid out in 1x1 meter blocks. The rationale behind this was that we could analyze where debris was coming from in a very specific area. This could possibly aid in the analysis of what type of activities were undertaken in this structure. We also predetermined that we wanted to take a 10% sampling of the soil and we determined what quadrants those would be based on their location in the structure. It is clearly shown on the dayplans from when this system was being used.    There was a series of fill loci that were opened that were delineated as interior or exterior fill. Loci 7068 and 7070 were interior fill. Loci 7067 and 7069 were exterior fill. There were other arbitrary fill loci assigned in the case that the walls did extend eastward. I wanted to keep the interior and exterior debris separate from one another, but the walls did not extend, so these loci ended up being completely arbitrary. But for the record, the fill that was labeled as interior included loci 7072, and 7077 and the fill that was labeled as being exterior included loci 7071, 7073, 7076 and 7078. The fill layers that had most of the debris were L7067 and L7068. They were riddled with pottery smashes and large animal bones, mainly of goat and cattle. It was this context that was captured in the measured top plan. After removing this fill loci, it became clear that there was no concrete surface that was visible. We called locus 7074 the exterior surface interface and locus 7075 the interior locus interface. We believe that it was just a transition in soil and not anything that would be visible in excavation.   Related to the relationships between the surfaces and the structure of 7053, is burial 7054 and fill 7055. Once the burial team extracted the burial and took out the excess fill, we found what seemed to be a doorpost in relation to where the southern wall ended. The doorpost was a semi-circular rock with a fairly deep depression in the center. This doorpost is small find F.7.7077.22. We took photos of the relationship and collected the doorpost.   After we had determined the nature of the relationship between the walls, the debris and the surfaces, it was time to determine the nature of the wall. We pushed wall probe 7052 down about 20 additional centimeters. The red soil seemed to be only one course that was followed by a lighter soil. I continued to push down the probe to see if it could be alternating red and white courses, but it did not seem to be the case. We dug around the structure and then took structure 7053 out. After we took out structure 7053, we ceased using the grid system.   After excavating this context, the trench was basically fill. I opened a series of arbitrary fill loci that included L7080, L7081, L7082, L7083, L7088, L7089, L7090, L7093 and L7096. In the midst of excavating these fill layers, there was a small pit that I opened as L7086. At least I thought it was a pit, but after taking off a few cms, it was clear that it was just soft dirt that was the same as the surrounding fill of 7089, so it was closed.    We also found another human burial that is L7084 in fill L7085. As of my last day of excavation, this burial had not yet been excavated, but plans include extracting this burial before the end of the dig season.    There also appeared in the Eastern half of the trench 2 circular features that we have not yet determined what their exact nature is. They both have slightly darker interiors and a lighter exterior border that measures about 20cms and surrounds the interior. The first was identified and excavated in the northeastern part of the trench. The interior was L7094 and the exterior border was L7095. The last day my trench was opened we started pushing down elevation in the interior of this feature. We did it in sections, _ was excavated in 5 cm. intervals and the other _ in 10 cm. segments. We found quite a few small finds in this feature. There were 2 whole pots that we were able to articulate and extract. One was a small bowl that is KT F.7.7094.9 and one is a larger pedastled bowl that is KT F.7.7094.4. We also found a small metal pin in this area. Due to these finds on my last day, the decision was made not to close this locus and keep it open after my departure so we can figure out the nature of this feature this season. The other circular feature is further south against the eastern baulk. The interior of this feature is L7099 and the exterior is L7100. This feature remained unexcavated for this season.    Some loci that don_Ñét really seem to fit in the groups I have discussed above include L7065 which was a feature of a ring of pottery and rocks. There was a similar feature in F8 last year. This had a goat metapodial in the center. The goat metapodial is KT F.7.7065.1 We articulated it, took photos, and removed it. Another such locus was a small pit in the southern half of the trench. It contained a small bird or rodent skeleton that was KT F.7.7066.1. I also need to mention L7092. I skipped a number on my locus sheets, so this locus is nothing. It does not exist.   The last thing to address is the loci that were opened but remained unexcavated for this season and have not yet been mentioned. This would be a pit L7087, an area of concentrated virgin soil in the southeastern corner L7097, and another pit, L7098.       III. Small Finds      The notable finds that I had this season that have not been mentioned above in relation to their contexts is as follows:   F.7.7048.4 - OBSIDIAN BLADE   F.7.7053.3 - CERAMIC RING/WEIGHT   F.7.7067.9 _ÑÐ SMALL FIGURINE   F.7.7069.62 _ÑÐ METAL PIN   F.7.7069.94 _ÑÐ OBSIDIAN BLADE   F.7.7070.8 _ÑÐ OBSIDIAN BLADE   F.7.7072.27-30 _ÑÐ POTTERY SMASH   F.7.7073.8 _ÑÐ OBSIDIAN BLADE   F.7.7073.39 _ÑÐ BURNISHING TOOL (?)

The East, South and West baulk only contained layers of topsoil, sub-topsoil, and perhaps another deposit. But none of them really reflect what is being found within my trench. The exception to that would be the North baulk. It has captured some of the cobbled surfaces from last year and this year. As for this year, both surfaces 7049 and 7059 are represented in the baulk. As for last year_Ñés loci, I have not analyzed them yet for the sections, so unfortunately I cannot be more specific.      Interpretation       F7 dates to the early Bronze Age and we had a very good context this year with which we can hopefully extrapolate a lot of insight into this time period. The structure 7053 was the first structure to be found in the lower mound and we were lucky enough to catch it entirely. The abundance of pottery, bones and lithics lead me to believe that it was used in a domestic context, perhaps in the context of meal preparation. The new circular features, Loci 7094 and 7095, and 7099 and 7100 could also be pits or ovens. Locus 7094 definitely holds some interesting pots and the idea has been tossed around that it may be for a cooking context. Hopefully as we come upon the next context in this trench and do the analysis of the material remains from this year, we will have a better idea of what it is.      Attention!          There was an area that I saw in the southwest corner that looked like a circular structure of reddish mudbricks. It was fairly obvious when I sprayed it with water, but it was not visible at the time I did my final day plan. Whoever excavates this trench next year may want to keep an eye out for it. It could possibly be a small oven.      Also, this year we used the wrong value for the F1 Datum. We were using 570.82, but we discovered it was the GPS point. Just an FYI!

It is a 5 x 5 meter trench and is directly to the west of C4. C3 and C2 are across the entrance road to the south of C1. This season I picked up where Pete left off after the 2001 season. At its highest point at the beginning of the season, C1 was at 595.80cm, 595.28cm at its midpoint and 595.10cm at its deepest. At the end of this season, the trench is at 595.14 at its highest point, 594.95 at its midpoint, and 594.62 at its lowest.      My main goal at the beginning of the season was to decipher the loci left from last season. Some things described as rock gardens were found to be walls and cobble surfaces this year. As the season progressed my goals changed to delineating the mudbrick surfaces and attempting to interpret inside versus outside work areas and surfaces. As I excavated, new kinds of pottery (for my trench at least) arose and it seems that rather than being smack in the middle of the second millennium, I might be delving into the third. I believe that I definitely achieved the fours goal and am still working towards the second, but look forward to pursuing this more next season. Enshahallah.      2Trench Information   2.1Loci Overview   This year_Ñés excavation began with the usual cleaning loci. L1067 was the initial baulk cleaning and L1070 was for the base of the trench. Other arbitrary cleaning loci for fill were 1076, 1082, 1085, and then later 1094, 1095, 1096, and 1099 were all used to clean away fill that had no other distinctions. Other smaller baulk cleaning loci were carried out throughout the season if it seemed that some stones or artifacts were threatening to fall or if the baulk was not as straight as could be desired. L1072 was an example of this on the south baulk of concentrated cobbles and pottery extending from the baulk. L1079 was a similar locus on the north baulk, with 1080 on the west.      The first loci to be dealt with in serious attention were 1069, 1077, 1075, and 1081 comprising the stone architectural features along the east baulk. Beginning from the north, L1081 was a single course cobble surface of mainly squarish cobbles carefully laid and secured. This was bonded with 1075 which is mainly delineated by two large white flagstones anomalous to the surrounding architecture. Between these tones was a great deal of flat lying pottery with a large piece of greenish slag in the center. There was also a tin layer of small pebbles spread on top of the pottery.      This continued south to L1069, the five course wall (L1077 actually comes first but 1069 was put down first). This wall was built upon a mudbrick foundation/wall L1083. Its first course was made of roughly oblong stones placed at a 45 degree angle into the baulk. The second course was of smaller cobbles with a good deal of pebbles in the mortar matrix. The third to fifth courses continued in increasingly larger stones to the boulders at the bottom. More information on these courses appears in the daily s. L1077 seemed to be a large pile of stones on the northern part of 1069 possibly joining with 1075. There were no discrete courses or rows visible in this locus.      In association with L1069, though not close to it, are loci 1071 and 1073. L1071 was described last season as an artifact scatter, but appeared to be more likely some sort of fill or foundation as I excavated since it kept to a long and regular rectangular border. A good deal of pottery and lithics were dumped into this fill. Associated with this locus in the north baulk was L1073 which was a good deal of cobbles and pottery arranged in a similar construction as L1069. Further linking the two features was a broken stone bowl, half of which was found used as a cobble in 1069 (KT1069.12) and the other half in 1073 (KT1073.7).      Directly to the west of the two flagstones of 1075 (and partially beneath them) was L1074 fire installation. This was made up of burnt earth, ash, and a great deal of pottery as a lining for the pit, including a possible early bronze age pedestal base. This locus seemed to end at a harder and more compact layer, but when that was removed by cleaning locus 1085, more ahs was uncovered and eventually L1097 was created for this ashy layer with three medium sized fire affected rocks directly in front of L1098, a possible oven base. These are actually at the same stratigraphic level as 1092, 1093, 1094, and 1087, but because of their continuance in the same area of possible cooking, I included them here. L1098 is a mudbricky platform that might have been an oven base, which was cleaned out into L1097. This locus is also beneath L1075.      On the same stratigraphic level as the stone wall was L1068 ash pit. This was a very compact ashy pit that continued down about 5-7cm. Below this compact layer was L1084, a very loose and dark ash pit. There were few artifacts found here ,but a great deal of ash. This locus continues under which the next main stratigraphic layer begins.      The next and main stratigraphic level of interest began below L1068 and 1084. L1092 is a low wall, possibly used as a windbreak, composed of two courses of stones each laid on a layer of large pot shards. It runs parallel to the north baulk and is partially encompassed by it. An east-west arm joins on the west side and protrudes out about 75cm. L1093 and 1094 were used to excavate around 1092. L1094 went to the west of 1092 and then wrapped around to the east around 1093. L1093 was within the confines of 1092 and was delineated by a clear line in the trench base. A good deal of pottery was removed from this area as well as carbon.      Directly to the south of this in 1094 a large in situ pot smash was uncovered. At least two vessels could be reconstructed from this locus (KT1094.12 and .13). Some of this pot smash was laying against the mudbrick wall 1089. Continuing south brings us to the north part of 1087. This locus continues in two parts, this northern .75 x .75m section and a larger mirror image to the southeast that is 1 x 2m in size. This is an interesting locus of uncertain depth yet, but based on a cross-section cut in pit 1100, it appears to continue down at least one more course, with the curses divided by a 1/5cm gray line with a fingernail thin plaster layer above and below. The two parts of the feature meet a mirror image point of a double course of gray bricks. The remaining bricks are of the regular beigish color. One unusual aspect of this feature is the size of the bricks, very narrow running about 10 x 35cm each. The south portion seems to arch slightly towards the west.      There was a line in the trench base connecting the south side of 1097 and 1098 with the north side of southern 1087 and the southern side of northern 1087 then ending at 1089. 1097 and 1098 are at the same stratigraphic level as 1089, 1092, and 1093. Also divided by this line is 1083, the mudbrick platform under 1069. This platform is continuing down and runs parallel to 1087. The individual bricks of 1083 are no longer distinct as they were about 10cm higher, but there is a distinct line with the outer 15-20cm separated from the interior of the surface.      All of this is bordered on the west by 1089, the mudbrick wall under 1071. This feature is continuing to the west and will be discussed in more detail with that half of the trench.      Moving along the southern part of the trench are two (and possibly three) rounded rectangular features of uncertain purpose, L1086 and 1088. The third may have been cut by pit 1100 which also cut 1087. These features are capped with mudbrick over a layer of compact dirt and followed by more mudbrick. Each layer of mudbrick seems to be divided into two bricks, one to the north and one to the south.      Finally to the western half of the trench, which is still a good 20-30cm below the eastern section. The main division as mentioned before between the east and western sections is the mudbrick wall 1089. This wall continues down in the west and there is a parallel mudbrick surface/feature approximately .75m to the west, L1101. Between these two loci, L1096 was removed to expose and articulate the sides of 1089 and 1101, but also ended up exposing another mudbrick surface below the fill. A good amount of broken flat lying pottery was found in the removal of this locus. L1101 has not been investigated to a great extent at this time since it was only in the last week of excavation that pit 1092 (just to the east of the unexcavated stair) was removed to show a nice cross-section of mudbrick from 1101 continuing parallel to 1089 and under the stair.      The main area that has not been explored in the eastern half of the trench is the southwestern corner. This was 1078 and had been left as an island of itself about 15-20cm above the rest of the trench after last season. When removing this locus, pit 1090 was uncovered. This pit was only partially excavated since it had been dug out previously without being found. This was a shallow ash pit lined with some sort of smooth and thin mudbricky surface. Below this pit 1090 and 1098 also continues there.      2.2Method   The tools used to excavate this trench were mainly small picks, trowels, and brushes. Screens were used when it seemed that artifacts could be recovered like with the cylinder seal which half was recovered by screening. When dealing with mudbrick ,which was often this season, the workers would approach the mudbrick with small picks and then finish articulating them with trowels.      2.3This season I only drew the eastern baulk. A great deal was going on in this baulk from previous excavation that I have not tried to interpret at this point. The north and south baulks have been very useful in attempting to interpret walls and other features excavated last season. The western baulk need to be cleaned back again as little is clear at this time.      3. Interpretation   The interpretation of C1 is still under progress but at this time it seems that there might be three separate areas of use, the western section with the walls is the most uncertain one, and then the possibility of the eastern section being divided into north and south, outside and inside.      The western side at this time appears to be an outside area, possibly the outside of a building or house with the possibility of one or two cooking areas. The mudbrick surface under 1096 and abutting 1089 ma be the base of this work area or passage.      The eastern half of the trench may be a second living area with the north as an outside area and the south as inside. The northern section is composed of the windbreak 1092 and possible pit/work area 1093. This is also associated with the ash pit and possible oven of 1097 and 1098. 1087 could possibly have been some sort of pavement from outside to inside. The outside area also had a great deal of carbon and animal bone. The southern section is hypothesized as an inside area. This consists mainly of the larger 1087 pavement, pit 1100, and the unusual features/pits of 1086 and 1087. Again the main division of the trench are wall 1089 dividing east and west and the line at trench base dividing north and south.      How C1 relates to the others in area C is as of yet uncertain other than that it is of an earlier date than the others since it is substantially lower (though Jakob_Ñés trench is getting close). The current elevation seems to be just entering the third millennium. Perhaps as the other trenches get deeper, the relationships will become more clear. AS for the rest of the site, it also seems that a great deal of third millennium evidence is being uncovered, so this might be able to link nicely with some of what is being excavated in other areas such as A and D.      4. Loose Ends and Advise   As for loose ends of warning for next season_Ñés excavation, I can only sum it up as everything is coming up mudbrick. Almost everything exposed at this point has mudbrick below it. After initial cleaning, I would recommend a liberal brushing with the whisk broom to look for the mortar lines. After an extra year to dry out, the lines may become more pronounced. The pits 1091 and 1100 both exposed more mudbrick, so cleaning one of those cross-sections could also elucidate more of what is happening in C1. also, when exposing 1092 some of the top course of stones on pottery are loose and could come off easily. It has been extensively photographed this season, so should be ready for removal soon in the 2003 season. Other than that, good luck. It is a great trench and has been very interesting to work in.

We looked at the area where we have already taken out bricks, soft dirt I thought was just compact fill has hardened to show itself as mudbrick. We can see in the section that was made by removing the mudbrick that 3083 is a mudbrick wall next to an ash layer (3085) and at some point some of the mudbrick collapsed over the ash layer. Also in the section of the ash layer we can see that there is a degraded mudbrick cap (3089) over it, possibly created by the destruction of 3083. That means that the ash layer is earlier than 3089 and that the ash layer and the wall were coeval or that the ash layer is earlier than the wall. We almost finished removing the cap above the ash layer and will probably finish it tomorrow. Wanting to see if the cobble surface, 3091, is related to the mudbrick wall 3083, we dug the dirt that we had left to protect the wall.

L17 had large amounts of pottery present. After digging for about 20cm there was a slight soil change. The color was different and the soil seemed more like little pellets. I changed to L 18. We had pushed through the topsoil and were now in subtopsoil or another type of fill. I got some opening photos of the new locus and we began digging again. We found a small fragment of a grindstone which I made a small find and treated accordingly.   Our goal was to remove L 18 all the way to the south baulk. We were not able to finish this.

After reviewing the soil this morning I felt that is was the same and it would be appropriate to use the same bags for the whole feature. Separating the bags may have been confusing and created a daunting amount of paperwork to wade through. I separated the bags yesterday not because the soil was different but merely as a precautionary measure. I wanted to make sure if we pushed through something on one side the other side would remain uncontaminated. We cleaned the walls and found we are still within the feature so I am using the same bags.   After cleaning the walls we sprayed them.

Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4,","   7-21-02   Weekly Summary   Trench A4         Work over the first week and a half has consisted of removing topsoil and sub-topsoil from previously unexcavated areas in the northeast and southeast sections of the A4 trench. No clear cultural features were revealed in either case, and excavation ceased with the exposure of human burials in each area. In the northeast section of the trench, the human remains took the form of several elements of a human hand (Locus 4023). Follow-up work within this locus located no further human bone and it was closed after clearing a 1x1 section.   The two burials in the southeastern section of the trench (Loci 4024 and 4025) are both juveniles. 4025 appears to be a newborn and has not yet been touched. Attention has instead focused on 4024 and two other burials originally located last year (Loci 4026/4011 and 4027/4012; the number before the slash corresponds to the locus number assigned this year, the number after the slash that assigned last year.). Of these, 4026 is a younger individual similar in size (and probably age) to 4024. 4027 is a larger, older individual, but still subadult. Although aging has not yet been done on the skeletons, burial 4027 appears to be between 10-14 years of age, and 4024 and 4026 between 2-4 years.   Unlike previously excavated burials, 4024, 4026, and 4027 all have grave goods associated with them. 4024 had a stone bead necklace, 4026 a bracelet (ceramic?) and one small bead, and 4027 a copper or bronze earring. Excavation of 4024 and 4027 is incomplete, so additional material may come up. This is especially true for 4027, which is only beginning to be exposed. Since we lack defined dates for the burials exhumed so far, we hope that stylistic variation in these artifacts will provide a clearer indication of their ages.   The only other item of interest is the relationship between the 4027 burial and Locus 4015. Locus 4015 was an elongated, oval shaped patch of slightly darker and much softer sediment identified in the bottom of the L4008 trench last year. It currently looks as if L4015 is the uppermost incidence of L4027. All of the material removed so far has been in soft sediments under 4015, and the orientation of the skeleton as excavated suggests that it will continue. If so, this is the first time that a burial has been indicated prior to discovery by a soil change.   A possible exception to this phenomenon may be several dense patches of stone found in the eastern portion of Trench A4 and in locus 6000 of Trench A6. One such patch (a \cist tomb\) contained a human burial beneath, and if it marks a consistent pattern may provide another indicator of burials prior to encountering them directly.         A4 Weekly Summary   08/04/2002            Because of the slow progress associated with burial excavation, I_Ñéve held off on the weekly summary.      Over the last week and a half, we have cleaned out the backdirt from all but the northernmost meter of A4 and identified and/or worked on 4 new burials. These are L4029, L4034, L4036, and L4038. L4029 was identified last year as L4005 and is a small infant or child. L4034, L4036, and L4038 area all new.      The L4034 burial is located in the same part of the A4 trench as a burial previously identified as L4003, but is different. The cranial material found associated with L4003 was part of an animal skull and redesignated as an area of fill with a high concentration of animal bone (L4028). L4034 was discovered later after rodent activity and heavy brushing revealed phalanges and carpals in the same general area. L4034 is the only fully adult individual exhumed from the A4 trench during the 2002 field season.      As mentioned last time, the 2002 burials are notable for the presence of funeral goods, especially jewelry. To date, all such material has been found with infant or juvenile (L4027) burials. These include:      L40241 bead necklace   L40261 ceramic or glass bracelet   L40271 bronze or copper earring   L40293 ceramic or glass bracelets   L40361 bead necklace, 1 earring      The necklaces found on L4036 and L4024 were superficially very similar. The earring found with L4036 was also notable. It was made with a center piece and a sequence of suspended beads. The string holding these beads together was still partially preserved, perhaps indicating a more recent burial. These two burials were also found at the highest point in the fill.      The ceramic or glass bracelets found on L4026 and L4029 are also superficially similar. They each resemble a series of bracelets located in the Dyarbakir museum and labeled as Roman or Hellenistic in age. The age of the bronze earring is completely indeterminate at this point.      If we take the current evidence at face value, it appears that the burials may span several millennia. The dating remains problematic, however. On the recent end we have the presence of intact string in the one earring and a 2000 burial with a C-14 bone date from the last hundred years. Unfortunately, the standard error on the C-14 date comes with a 95% CI of plus or minus 800 years and the presence of string is no guarantee of a recent origin. On the other end we lack clear confirmation of the age of the bracelets. The L4029 burial clearly post-dates the Early Iron Age, having been cut through deposits associated with that time period. No evidence of Roman or Hellenistic period occupations have been found in any part of the excavations so far, however, leaving the question of how late these burials are open to debate. All of this points to a continuing need to arrange for the direct dating of a larger sample of human bone.               Weekly Summary   8/10/02      Most of the work in A4 over the last part of the field season was spent on exhuming burials, notably 4034. The other major point of interest was the L4013/L4040 \cist tomb\      L4040 was identified toward the end of last year (2001-L4013) and consisted of a large, 50x80cm piece of flat stone bordered on the north, east, and west by smaller rocks and extending into the southern sidewall of the L4008 part of the A4 trench. A similar arrangement of rocks was found in A7 and their removal revealed an associated human burial. Because of the similarity in construction and presumed content, both features were considered \cist tombs\.      After removing dirt from around 4040 we found additional associated stones, again reminiscent of a burial. We then removed the large, flat stone originally identified last year and the smaller rock bordering it on the north. Below this was a 3-4cm thick layer of hard packed dirt sitting on top of another surface of mud brick, mud brick fill, and another stone similar in size to the first but offset to the northeast. We also noted several areas containing at least two courses of stacked stone.      Although 4040 may well be a cist-tomb and cover a human burial, it is no longer clear-cut. We have simply designated it as an \unknown architectural feature\. There are a large number of stones associated with oven debris located in 4037 just to the southeast and the intervening 4037 fill should be removed to see if they articulate with 4040. 4040 also appears as if it may extend further to the north and east, and needs to more fully exposed before removing additional stones. We opted to leave this for next season and to concentrate on existing burials in A4, G6, and D5. If these stones do actually cover a burial, the remains will stay well protected.        ,~: A-4-2002-08-10-Comp.

We also removed L1076, the pavement locus, as well as a new locus 1094, which is an ashy layer which was below 1076. This locus 1094 is also equal to earlier ash locus 1077.      Much of the day was spent troweling back to follow the large surface as it spread across the trench. In the middle of the trench we came upon a rim of pottery which seemed to be the top of a large jar of pottery which is buried in this surface. We also dug down further in 1082 to also follow this surface. It appears that this locus 1089 is definitely a surface and it is spreading like wildfire.      Nothing much else to report on this day.

A4 is an 8m by 8m area cross cut by two, two meter wide trenches. One extension trench is 8m long and runs north to south. The other extension is a smaller, 4m long trench branching off the main extension and running east to west. These two trenches excavated an average of 30 to 50cm below ground surface and had revealed a total of 8 potential burials by the end of the 2001 field season.         2.0 The Burials      Work in 2002 began by removing unexcavated material from the 4 by 4m block in the northeast quadrant of A4 and the 2 by 4m block in the southeast quadrant down to a level near the existing trench floors. 5 additional burials were revealed in the process. With the exception of the burials themselves, all sediments were removed using picks and shovels and were unscreened. Burials were exhumed using small tools and screened through 2mm hand sieves.      8 burials were removed from the A4 trench this year. Those newly identified include a collection of hand bones from 4023 and infants in 4024, 4025, and 4036. Those from last year include infants or younger juveniles in 4005/4029, 4012/4027, 4011/4026. A burial identified last year as 4003 turned out to be the skull of a large mammal, but an adult human was identified this year in the same general location (L4034). With the exception of 4023, all of the burials exhumed this year were laid out with their heads to the west or southwest and feet to the east or northeast. 4023 was unarticulated and lacked visible orientation.      Of all the burials in A4 identified this year and last, 4006 and 4007 remain located and unexcavated. We failed relocate either 4002 or 4010, though both are presumably still interred. This is especially true of 4010, which was an adult sized ulna located along the margin of A4 and A6. A fair amount of the back dirt leaked under the edge of the plastic near 4010 and might have buried it more deeply than expected.      The 2002 burials are notable for the presence of grave goods, especially jewelry. To date, all such material has been found with infant or juvenile (L4027) burials. These include:      L40241 bead necklace   L40261 ceramic or glass bracelet   L40271 bronze or copper earring   L40293 ceramic or glass bracelets   L40361 bead necklace, 1 earring      The necklaces found on L4036 and L4024 were superficially very similar. The earring found with L4036 was also notable. It was made with a center piece and a sequence of suspended beads and the string holding these beads together was still partially preserved.   The ceramic or glass bracelets found on L4026 and L4029 are also superficially similar. They each resemble a series of bracelets located in the Dyarbakir museum and labeled as Roman or Hellenistic in age. Although the age of the bronze earring is indeterminate at this point, Nevin Soyukaya of the Diyarbikir museum thinks the bracelets are made of glass and actually Medieval rather than Hellenistic. She noted that they are nearly identical to similar bracelets recovered from a well dated church cemetery in Mardin, Turkey some 100km away.            3.0 Excavation and Stratigraphy      As mentioned, excavations focused on two blocks of earth. A 4x4m area in the northeast of A4 ( orth block\) and a 2x4m area in the southeast (_ÑÉsouth block\) I_Ñéll discuss each in turn.      A total of five loci were identified and excavated in the northeastern block: 4016, 4017, 4021, 4022, and 4023. The first three of these were identified by their stratigraphic position (top to bottom) and excavated sequentially over the entire 4x4m area. 4023 was identified by the presence of human hand bones and ended up being a roughly 50x50cm exploratory unit meant to trace out a large burial. No additional material was actually found, and 4022 was simply identified as the layer of dirt into which 4023 cut. Thus 4016, 4017, and 4021 have been removed and 4022 remains untouched. 4016, 4017, and perhaps 4021 can be collectively considered a band of undifferentiated topsoil.       The south block was both smaller and more complicated due to the presence of numerous burials and other features. As in the northeast, work began by removing a series of loci in stratigraphic order until reaching evidence of human burials. These loci were 4018 and 4019 and again represent generally unconsolidated topsoil and subtopsoil. Less total sediment was removed in this part of the trench prior to seeing human remains, possibly because it sits higher on the site and has seen more erosion.      The two burials identified were 4024 and 4025, and each cut into an underlying deposit identified initially as 4020 (similar in position and concept to 4022). Although 4020 was initially thought to span the entire 2x4m area, rocks and also oven material were noted in its western extent as early as 7/15/02. Because initial work focused on the burials, no attempt was made to subdivide the area. This would change after the burials were removed and it was decided to remove the remaining layer of 4020 down to the level of the 4013/4040 rock feature (cist tomb) during the last week. At this point, work showed the eastern one third of the trench to be clearly different from the west. The area was assigned locus 4037 and considered separately from 4020.      Work on the two burials in the main trench floor (4029, 4034) resulted in several locus assignments during excavations. Because the 4003 burial from last year turned out to be non-human and because a large amount of animal bone came from the southern end of the A4 main trench last year, the floor of the trench in the last meter or so was assigned L4028. The trench floor in all other parts of A4 (at roughly 603.5m) was assigned 4035. This includes the floor of the north-south and east-west branches. The locus 4005/4029 burial was then sufficiently traced out to determine its orientation was east west, and work began on removing a 50cm wide strip along the western edge of the south block in order to make space for work and exhumation. While removing 4020 in this area we identified an area of softer fill in the center of the strip (4031), an area of much harder, mud-brick like fill in the south (4030), and relatively undifferentiated fill in the north (4032). All were located under 4020.      Subsequent excavations in 4020 and 4037 would show that 4030 was a roughly 50cm wide strip of hard, mud-brick like fill running east-west along the southern margin of the south block covered by 4020 and covered by and partially abutting 4037. 4031 fill is actually part of the 4034 burial, which paralleled 4029 but which actually ran into the south block. 4031 and 4034 are thus identical. 4032 is now considered to be part of locus 4039, which is the layer of dirt underlying 4020 in the west part of the south block above the 4035 trench floor. At the close of excavations this year, the south block is a 2x4m area of sediment and cultural debris extending some 15-20cm above the L4035 trench floor. The block is basically divided into three areas: an area of undifferentiated fill in the western two thirds of the block (4039), an area of fill with numerous rocks and fragments of oven fill in the eastern one third of the block (4037), and a strip of hardened, mud brick fill running along the southern margin (4030). 4039 and 4037 are each then cut by other features including burials, the 4040 rock feature, and the 4033 ashy pit or midden. Nothing cuts 4030.      We did not work with the L4004 rock alignment in the north-south (L4000) portion of A4 this year and it remains. We also did no work in the deeper sounding at the very northern extent of A4. Since this area was and remains covered by plastic and backdirt, it does not show up on any of this years top plans.         4.0 Directions for further work      4.1 Burials      If we take the current evidence at face value, it appears that the burials may span many centuries. However, the dating remains problematic. On the recent end we have the presence of intact string in the one earring and a year 2000 burial with a C-14 bone date from the last hundred years. Unfortunately, the standard error on the C-14 date comes with a 95% CI of plus or minus 800 years and the presence of string is no guarantee of a recent origin. On the other end we lack clear confirmation of the age of the bracelets. The L4029 burial clearly post-dates the Early Iron Age, having been cut through deposits associated with that time period. No evidence of Roman or Hellenistic period occupations have been found in any part of the excavations so far, however, strengthening the hypothesis of a Medieval origin but still leaving the question of how late open to debate. All of this points to a continuing need to arrange for the direct dating of a larger sample of human bone.      Next seasons excavations would be well served by acquiring funds to date directly the human material and then selecting the broadest possible sample of skeletal material. Rather than focusing on one area (e.g. A4), sample from some of the other burials identified in 2001 in trenches A3, A5, A6, and A7. Aim not only for variation spatially, but also stratigraphically, selecting burials which have occurred deeper in the deposits. Consider extending some excavated units deeper in the hope of finding additional material. Many of the burials located to date either are or appear to be from younger individuals and occur at quite shallow depths.         Non-burial features          L4040 was identified toward the end of last year (2001-L4013) and consisted of a large, 50x80cm piece of flat stone bordered on the north, east, and west by smaller rocks and extending into the southern sidewall of the L4008 part of the A4 trench. A similar arrangement of rocks was found in A7 (A6 L.6010?) and their removal revealed an associated human burial. Because of the similarity in construction and presumed content, both features were considered \cist tombs\.      After removing dirt from around 4040 we found additional associated stones, again reminiscent of a burial. We then removed the large, flat stone originally identified last year and the smaller rock bordering it on the north. Below this was a 3-4cm thick layer of hard packed dirt sitting on top of another surface of mud brick, mud brick fill, and another stone similar in size to the first but offset to the northeast. We also noted several areas containing at least two courses of stacked stone.      Although 4040 may well be a cist-tomb and cover a human burial, it is no longer clear-cut. We have simply designated it as an \unknown architectural feature\. There are a large number of stones associated with oven debris located in 4037 just to the southeast and the intervening 4037 fill should be removed to see if they articulate with 4040. 4040 also appears as if it may extend further to the north and east, and needs to more fully exposed before removing additional stones. We opted to leave this for next season and to concentrate on existing burials in A4, G6, and D5. If these stones do actually cover a burial, the remains will stay well protected.      A second area of interest untouched during this season involves the architecture and burials in A5. Several rock foundations possibly associated with iron-age occupations and cross cut by human burials were located in A5. It would be useful and interesting to trace out these foundations with the goal of defining clear-cut interior and exterior contexts of complete or nearly complete buildings. One could then use this information to help identify interior and exterior surfaces, track assemblage variation, identify possible work areas, and mark the association, if any, with visible burials. While the mixed nature of the fill in this area makes this a challenge, I think the difficulty is offset by the relative ease of exposing larger spatial area. Similar comparisons would be prohibitive in older and deeper soundings covered by several meters of overlying occupations.     ,~dc-terms:title: A-4-2002-08-011-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4,"940,2002-08-11," D-5-2002-08-011-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Area D   Trench 5   Week Ending August 11, 2002      The two mains goals for this week were to give the human skeleton in the far NW a proper excavation and determine to what context it belongs, in particular if it relates to the Ubaid contexts in the S, and to prepare the trench for a plan shot, which entailed sorting out the N pit situation, cleaning up nicely and trying to find the N extent of the Ubaid contexts.   The first goal was pretty straight-forward and, from my point of view, is simply a time sink and thankfully a week is enough time to get it mostly done. However, according to Andrew, one of the bone experts kind enough to take time to work on the remains, it is a particularly tricky skeleton due to its flexed and prone position and the age and generally poor preservation of the skeleton. Nonetheless, cleaned off the skeleton does look rather impressive positioned the way it is. Early guesses put its lifetime age between 20 and 50, likely towards the later end of that spectrum and possibly assign its gender as female, though the crushed nature of the bones (notably the pelvis) make the second assertion a bit more tenuous. Speaking of the age of the skeleton as a deposit, a Late Chalcolithic rim sherd found literally within the skeleton allows us to make a good argument for it dating to that period (and thus not the Ubaid).   The northern pit situation went well, large NE ash pit L5116 was shown to cut both E-central oven L5111 and N-central plaster-lined pit L5122. L5116 was a bit larger than expected but nothing earth-shattering while L5122 turned out to be more shallow and smaller than expected, save that we may have uncovered more of it now that we_Ñére under L5116 in parts of the central-E.   On the other hand, tracing the Ubaid surfaces proved tricky because, though we were under the pits we had already seen, we came into traces of new pits and/or foundation trenches after tracing the Ubaid context about 30 more cm N. At this point we decided it was best to take the plan shot before the long-exposed S contexts took any additional damage and considering the needed time investment to try and find a fragmentary and possibly not-even-extant surface, especially given it was already shown the burial was later.   Procedures for next week are to excavate the exposed Ubaid context, in the process double-checking our work to date, and then preparing the trench for close-down.        ,~: D-5-2002-08-011-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"941,2002-08-11," Burial-Obs-A-4-4034 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 4/Locus 4034/Finds Bag 1,","Area A, Trench 4Locus 4034, KT 4 (recorded 11 Aug, 2002)Recorded by: RR PaineL. 4034 was an extended burial of an adult.

The northeast part of L18 (2.30x1.40m) was taken different bags and KT numbers (KT 14, 15, 16) because this area had different soil color (little dark) and it was the softer than the other soil so we thought it was a possible pit. After digging it, we found a broken jar pieces. L18 was really rich about pottery.    On the near south of the L19 (the cobble stones area) there was a mortar (570.51; it is still stays here). We began to dig the near southeast of L19 and we saw some stones on this area and maybe the cobble stones are continuing through the east but we do not know yet because we could not dig the south part of L18 (2x3m) due to not enough time.     ,~: F-14-2002-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 14/Locus 1,"943,2002-08-11," B-4-2002-08-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 4/Locus 4036,","   August 8, 2002   Area B   Trench 4   Daily       We started the day by removing the rock (the large one on the day play) on the bottom of L4028.

We did much debri removal in L6, finding much random collapse. We discovered the new surfaces L37 and L31 (L31 was unfortunately was mixed with the fill above, however as we have not excavated the surface, should not be a problem. All Kts except #14 refer to the fill.). We pushed down further in L29, finding many layers and taking many samples but not yet reaching a definitive end. However, we did expose further continuation of the strange hard wall L5 all the way around almost to L14, abutting the conglomerate rock L35 on the way.      We removed L15 (the rock garden in the South center) and discovered large sherds and debri under the much larger stones, and then surface L17 continuing under that. We then excavated most of L17, leaving only a small portion to relate to L20. We then cut a section (L38) through this to the bottom of L20, discovering that L17 merges with the curved custom mb bottom of the bathtub shaped L20. Under L17 was first the fill L36 and then another surface (L37). We do not yet know the relationship between L37 and L20.

Also after digging a bit in the S of L3085, we saw that the soil was changing to a harder, more compact soil. This is the end of the ash layer, and the layer looks like it continues to the baulk. We took down the area SE of L3085 as L3093, a fill layer and the area W of L3085 as a mixed locus, ash layer and mudbrick cap, L3094. L3094 is equal to L3085. We found two interesting things today, a large 20cm+ piece of slag coming out of the baulk in L3093, and the right half of a human jaw, age 16+, from the N portion of L3094. We collected the bits pf slag that broke off but left the remainder in the baulk. We looked carefully for any other human bones, but found none.

The beginning of this week, it was changed as L14 (compacted silt loam). L14 was dug 10cm to see were the sections on the east baulk continuing on this area or not. However, as a result, we could not see anything about this.     On L14, there were some rocks like a piece of a surface to understand this; we widened the trench 6x2m from the L14 through the north. When we were digging this area the topsoil was L15; the second level was L16 (clay). On the L16, we saw a cobble stones area like a foundation wall (3.25x1.70m), L19. L16 was really rich about pottery.    We wondered about is this wall continuing through the east or not. To understand this, the trench was widened 2m through the east and 8m on the north-south direction. This area was firstly dug 30cm as L17 (topsoil) and secondly dug 20cm as L18 (silt loam). L17 was not rich about pottery, lithics and bones. However, L18 was really rich about pottery. There were some huge pieces of jars and vessels.

This 2m- wide by 10m-long trench is oriented according to the slope of the mound, rather than exact cardinal directions, thus A2 runs roughly SSE to NNW. Trench A2 was continued from last year by the same excavator, Eleanor Moseman, who reached the bottom of subtopsoil and had begun excavating slope wash layers above the sealed contexts she excavated this year. The south terminus of A2 for the 2002 season lies at the 5m peg, measured from the original south baulk at the 0m peg. The north terminus of A2 is co-equal with the south baulk for Trench A8 (roughly at the 15m peg). The step trench was formerly named A2 from the 0m peg to the 25m peg; this year the step trench was divided into 5 parts: from 0m to 5m remains A2 but was closed due to dangerously high baulks; from 5m to 15m also remained A2 (active this season); from 15m to 25m became A8 (excavated by Ilya); from 25m to 32m became A9 (excavated by Michaelle); and a 2m x 2m sounding called A10 was dug at the northern terminus of the step trench (dug by Rob).       Trench A2 ended 2001 field season with Locus 2111 and began the 2002 season with Locus 2112. The 2002 season ended with Locus 2146. When A2 was begun this year, it was approximately 2m deep, measured from the top of the west baulk to the base of the trench at the 5m peg. When the 2002 season ended, the trench was approximately 5m deep at the 5m peg. The goal for A2 this season was to \flatten\ the step from the 5m peg to the 15m peg, creating one continuous step; by the end of the season A2 was \flattened\ up to the 12m peg, leaving two small steps of 1.5m length each (these contained loci 2121, 2122, and 2123 which were not excavated this season). The purpose for digging A2 was to produce sealed loci for stratigraphic sequencing of the mound.       A2 in a nutshell: at the end of the 2001 field season we had not figured out what the never-ending ash layers between the 5m and 7m pegs were. This season we discovered that these ash layers are slope wash on top of a massive mudbrick wall with a stone foundation. Also, the area between the 8-9m pegs seemed to be a surface at the end of the 2001 season. This year, we confirmed that indeed from roughly the 8m peg to the 10m peg lies a series of surfaces associated with the massive mudbrick wall. We did not dig north of the 12m peg this season. I will discuss the excavation of A2 in two parts: first the massive wall and second the series of surfaces north of the wall.         The Massive Wall      We began slowly, using big picks and small picks to push down the fill below last year_Ñés ash lenses (these ash lines are preserved clearly in the east baulk). We peeled off L2114 as fill from the 5m peg to the 7m peg and continued pushing down there with a big pick. In L2114, we encountered patches of large (25x30cm), seemingly unorganized mudbricks in plan-view. We continued digging with a big pick, expecting to read the baulks to determine what these patches of mudbricks compose. Simultaneously we peeled off L2113 and L2115 at the 7-8m pegs as fill and found the top of two mudbrick bands, L2126 and L2125. We peeled back with small picks at the south edge of 2126, looking for the base of the band, expecting to find courses of a wall. We encountered another mudbrick band with alternating green and red bricks south of 2126; this band later became L2132. We cut a 1m wide section with a big pick (dug as 2114) into the east end of 2132 to identify the structure; in this eastern half corresponding to 2132 we came down on a white impression of a reed mat (L2130) running into the south edge of 2126 and the east baulk. This reed mat was identical to the reed mats that came up in A8 and Area C this season. There were very few sherds and only bone associated with an animal burrow in the east baulk that came out of the soil above 2130-reed mat. Thus I decided that the reed mat was not an occupational surface. We continued pushing down L2114 as \fill\ looking for the foundations of the three wall sections 2132, 2126, and 2125. We also scraped off a layer of crumbly fill (as L2127) from the top of a layer of harder mudbrick (later named 2129) that is the western continuation of mudbrick wall 2126. This crumbly fill layer (2127) appears to be part of a long band of crumbly, clay filled  rash\ that is preserved in the west baulk all the way to the south baulk. We did not see this band during excavation of 2114, until we could view it in section. This band of crumbly clay  rash\ marks a transition between undifferentiated mudbrick collapse in 2114 above the clay band and clear brick bands in 2114 below the clay band. Because we could never find organized brick bands in plan as we excavated 2114 south of 2132, we cut into this component of the wall system. Once we interpreted the mudbrick bands of 2114 as a wall structure, and once we found the reed mat (2130) in the eastern half of 2114, we switched to L2131 to excavate the area of mudbrick bands south of 2132. Still, in L2131, we could never find more than 3 or 4 contiguous, neatly organized bricks in plan, and continued to dig with a big pick looking for the base of wall 2126/2132 on the south side.       Finally while digging 2131 one half at a time with a big pick we came down onto the tops of large cobblestones at the west baulk, south of 2132. We called these cobbles L2139 and articulated them, expecting that they served as the foundations for the wall system we had been excavating. We changed locus to 2140 at the south edge of the cobbles-2139 and pressed down 2140, only to discover a second white impression of a reed mat (L2141) 1.3m below and to the west of reed mat 2130. Finding reed mat 2141 confirmed that these reed mats were used as structural components for building mudbrick walls, and were indeed not occupational surfaces. This hypothesis is consistent with the reed mat and mudbrick relationship(s) in A8.       While digging the west half of 2131, we identified a white line running east-west through the mudbrick area near the south baulk. As we pressed down 2131, we saw in the west baulk and in the section on the east half of 2131 that the white line migrated southwards, creating a diagonal line in the baulk and section. Before removing the eastern half of 2131, I excavated brick layers above the clear top terminus of this white line and then cut away the narrow band of soil between the white line and the south baulk to get a section on the line. I suspected that this line might be a reed mat lying vertically between two components of the mudbrick wall. Seen in section this white line turned out to be plaster instead of reed mat. Having answered this question, we pushed down L2131-east to the level of the cobble foundation L2139. We saw that the wall founded on 2139 is oriented east-west. We pushed down south of the foundation locus, removing the reed mat L2141 in the process, in order to find the base of the foundation courses. In sum, we found 3 courses of cobbles on the south side of L2139. While pressing down this area of 2140 (mudbrick layers), through 2141 (reed mat), and into L2144 (more mudbrick layers below reed mat), we encountered a third reed mat (L2145). This reed mat remains in situ at the close of the 2002 season.       On the north side of the massive wall system, we pressed down through a series of surfaces, which I will discuss below. On the north edge of L2125-band of mudbricks, we exposed large white stones that were the northern terminus of L2139-stone foundations. We shaved back the north edge of 2125 with trowels and exposed the entire band of stones corresponding to 2139. Once the mudbrick wall on top of 2139 was \floating\ in space, we tore down The Wall. We accomplished this using big picks to rip out the components of mudbrick bands locus by locus in order to preserve any potential sequencing of construction. After the entire foundation (north to south edge) was exposed and articulated, we created a measured drawing and stopped digging in the southern-most part of the trench.      Series of Surfaces      We began by excavating L2118, which was an ash \hump\ intruding into L2115 (these loci were left over from last year and renamed). We then pushed down this area as L2124; this locus contained a significant amount of occupational debris. Once L2124 reached the level of L2116, we shaved off L2116 with trowels and small picks. L2116 also contained lots of occupational debris. We changed locus underneath 2116 when we reached the top of an ash layer (L2128) visible in the north section of this mini-step. We trowel southwards as L2128 to remove the ashy soil, which ended well before reaching the north edge of L2125. Thus we retained L2124 as the locus adjacent to 2125. We changed locus once 2124 and 2128 were at the same elevation, in order to unify the mini-step which no longer bore distinguishing sub-divisions in plan-view. The new surface locus 2133 was a beaten earth surface with a shallow ash lens at its north edge. We peeled off this surface with small picks and trowels and exposed the underlying ash surface, L2134. We peeled off this ash layer and exposed the underlying beaten earth surface L2135, which had an odd reddish area in the south-east corner adjacent to 2125 and the east baulk. We named this reddish area L2138 and cut away L2135 with small picks. We changed locus to L2136 after digging down 10cm into L2135, because logically, I did not think a beaten earth surface should be much deeper than that and we had no freshly cut section to determine what we were digging. Thus we dug the west half of 2136 down to the level of a soil color change to red (this red soil became 2137), as seen in the north section cut. When we dug the eastern half of 2136, we exposed oven parts or mudbricks charred on one side (not quite andirons, as they would not come out intact). After we removed 2138, we saw that the east baulk preserves the very hard reddish soil of 2138 as well as a clearly defined chocolate-brown brick slumping northwards in section. Additionally, the southern edge of 2138 has neatly applied gray mortar from the base of 2138 up to the top of 2138; this mortar connects 2138 to 2125. This gray mortar does not extend a single centimeter lower than the base of 2138. I do not know what 2138 is, but it seems that it was intentionally and carefully positioned flush against the north face of the massive wall system.       To continue with the series of surfaces: we removed the east half of 2136 down to the level of the brown to red soil change and switched to L2137. This locus seems to be hard packed mudbrick-like fill resting on top of a series of stone surfaces. L2137 lies on top of the southern continuation of L2117-pebble surface (the northern part of this locus was excavated last year and left in situ). This pebble pavement L2117 did not continue up to the wall 2125/2139. The space between the southern edge of 2117 and the massive wall was named L2142 and excavated as fill; in retrospect, this locus is equal to 2137 as fill. We peeled off the fill of 2142 (screening 1:3 on a small gauge screen) and found another pavement (L2143) constructed of small cobbles extending underneath the pebble pavement-2117. This cobble pavement 2143 runs up just short of 2139 and stops in a clean line 8cm north of the mudbrick supporting 2139 (see photos). I think that this 8cm gap is caused by the workmen undercutting the foundation too severely and means that 2143 probably abuts 2139. At this juncture we took a spider shot of the trench, showing (from south to north): L2140 (terminating in a white plaster line), 2141, 2139, 2143, 2117, 2120. We peeled off L2117 and screened 100% of the soil on a small gauge screen from that pavement as we came down on the northern continuation of 2143-cobble pavement. We then took another spider shot of the trench (nb: in the mean time we had peeled off 2141-reed mat and dug down through L2114-mudbrick layers and left reed mat L2145 exposed for the picture); this second spider shot shows (from south to north): L2145, 2139, 2143, 2120. After taking this spider shot, we peeled off L2143 cobble pavement and exposed the underlying pebble pavement L2146. This third stone pavement runs up to meet (and possibly runs underneath) the mudbrick base supporting the stones of 2139 (this joint is visible in the west baulk where the small stones of 2146 run into 2139).      The Baulks   The south baulk preserves a record of the massive mudbrick wall. The top edge and down c. 1m was excavated last year; this area shows a mudbrick wall of alternating yellow and gray bricks in the east half. This mudbrick wall is cut by a large pit of gray-brown crumbly soil. There are amorphous bands of green clay and red mudbricky soil as well as bands of ash layers, corresponding to the ash lenses excavated last year. At the top of L2114, only mudbrick collapse is visible and then, below the area corresponding to the green clay band in the west baulk, the form/outline of the motley red, gray, pink, brown and pink brick layers in the south baulk becomes more defined. At the elevation corresponding with the top of 2139, the colors of the brick bands shift to stronger/darker red and no green bricks are used. There are traces of plaster lines preserved in the lower west corner of the south baulk.       The west baulk tells the story of the massive wall. The mudbrick collapse in the upper elevations of 2114 is visible above the green clay band. Below the green clay band, the brick bands become more distinct, and wrap around into the south baulk. The green brick bands stop below the top elevation of the foundation L2139. Beside the foundation to the south, the bricks are strictly red and brown (no green) and the diagonal plaster line dives into the south baulk. It is clear that this plaster line separates an area of mudbrick collapse that is falling northwards the massive wall, but that the bricks south of the white plaster line belong to a separate entity from the massive wall (or may be rebuild that is slumping northwards?). At the 7-8m pegs, the courses of 2132, 2129, 2125 are clearly preserved in the baulk. North of the wall, the ash layers corresponding to the series of surfaces are preserved, although they are less legible than the mudbrick wall. The cobbles and pebbles of the stone pavement series are preserved at the base of the west baulk. From the north edge of the series of surfaces, most of the west baulk is slope erosion and topsoil all the way down to the southern baulk of A8.           ,~dc-terms:title: A-2-2002 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 2,"958,2002-08-13," A-9-2002-08-013-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,","   Weekly Summary   Trench A9   Week 6   August 13, 2002         L26 is the bottom of the pit in L23. We found it the day previous and cut down 10cm of L26 to insure that we were really at the bottom of the pit, which is a hard clayey fill devoid of ash. We cleaned the section and flattened the area we cut the day previous and found that there may be a surface in the SW corner of the locus we found an animal jaw bone, and some flat lying potsherds. We were unable to keep the jaw in situ because it was stepped on, we put it in the bone bag we used for cleaning the locus. We will not dig in this area until we reach the level of L26 in the rest of the trench.       L22 is the hard clayey fill around the pit that is considered the wall of the pit even though there are no brick lines. This week we cut the wall around the pit and began flattening the area to note any changes in the fill. We found a pot smash which we called L28 which we later discovered was pottery debris on a surface. The first day we opened L28 we articulated the pot KT #2 a delicate fine ware bowl that we had to take out immediately because it was in so may pieces already. We also took out the thicker cooking ware sherds directly beneath the pot smash. We later realized while picking off fill from the area that we were on top of a surface. We changed to L29 with L22 as the fill above the surface. We found that L29 had an ashy hearth area at its SW corner and we could see that the pot shards on the surface were not stamped into the fill as with the surfaces in L30 and L32, they were simply lying on the surface. We kept L28 as the pottery off the surface and we cleared the pottery and dug about 5cm down to clear the surface. While articulating the surface we came down in L22 in the fill surrounding to see if the surface extended further or if there was any associated architecture. We found some cobbles along the west baulk. They did not look very organized, found a door post among them and pair of cobbles that looked like they formed a flat working surface. We also began finding a good deal of obsidian, not blades but flakes, in this area at the west baulk. The trench continued as we moved down in the locus and into L34 and as we went deeper we found obsidian in every locus. We cleared the surface L29 and brought L22 down to the level of L29 changed the area that was L22 and L29 to fill below the level of the surface L34. Note the fill has not changed from the compacted clayey loam that it was in L22, even the surface was the same fill.       In L34 we have spent the last few days trying to articulate a mudbrick wall area. At the junction between L33 and L34, we found some more cobbles along the west baulk and pedastalled them looking for a feature to associate them to. When we began taking off the cobbles we found an Ubaid pot sherd under one of the cobbles. We began picking up these sherds only in the area south of the mudbrick in L33. Basically we only find Ubaid sherds in L34.      The north half of the trench was a different matter this week.      L25 was opened under L16 in the 4-7.6m peg which is an area of slope wash fill. We thought that the fill in L16 was a different color so we changed locus to L25 but we realized that they L16 and L25 were equal. We closed L16 when we opened L25. We dug L25 up to and against L27 mixed ashy fill and compacted fill north of L22. In section we could see that there was a pebble surface coming up. We found a small andiron in the SW corner of the locus that was in loose ashy fill. After picking up the andiron we changed the south meter of the locus to L35 because this area was very ashy and not like the fill at the end of the slope.       In L35 we cut the 1x2m area down about .15m to get a better view of the section of L27, 30, 32 etc. We could see a few more surfaces below the surfaces already excavated in L30, and L32. Found that we had at least 1 more surface beneath L42 at the floor of L35.       In L27, opened under L16 and L22 as mixed fill on top of a surface L30 we found areas of hard clay fill mixed with ashy areas. We closed L27 after clearing a few centimeters when we opened L30 as a surface below this mixed fill.       We opened L30 in the entire 1x2m area of L27 because the surface extended to most of this area but was not uniform so it looked a bit random and hard to define its border. Originally we thought that the surface was a debris layer with pebbles and sherds stamped into hard compacted clay. We photographed the area and began to take it off of the NE corner of L27 when we started to find more of the surface heading south and sloping upward. We continued digging out the surface with out getting opening elevations for the new extension to the south but we had only dug about 5cm in that area as L27 so it was easy estimate the opening elevations. We took off the surface L30 and changed the fill below to L31.       In the transition between L30 and L31 is where we caught our first sight of the red mudbrick wall that would become L39. At the SW corner of the L30 and L31 we found one large red brick perfectly preserved, much larger than a regular size brick so it probably represented a few bricks melted together and we couldn_Ñét see the lines. Below this was an area of green flaky fill in L31 that may have been associated mudbricks to the red brick. But we cut through them as we came up on the surface in L32.       L32 is a pebble, pottery and bone debris surface stamped into hard compacted clay, very similar to the previous surface in L30 but much better preserved. We could see in the section adjacent to L31 that we were coming down on a surface so we went right to it in L31 and closed it when we got to the top and articulated the surface. The surface started at the east baulk and continued about 1m long and .5m wide. We did not find any small finds on this surface. We took photos of the surface and then cleared it. We could see that another surface was coming up in the section below L32. We opened L33 as fill below the surface in L33, the fill above and abutting the surface in L31.       In L33 we cleared fill around the red brick at the SW corner and found that it had a stone cobble foundation. We also saw a thin red line of mudbrick that continued from the east edge of the brick and cobble wall towards the east baulk. The line was very clear but we could not see the bricks themselves very well. It seemed to be associated with the mudbrick and cobbles but it is below the level of the stone foundation so maybe this wall is an earlier construction or a function of the slope that the wall was built on.         ,~: A-9-2002-08-013-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,"959,2002-08-13," F-14-2002-08-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 14/Locus 1,","   AREA: F TRENCH: 14   AUG 13, 2002    Today, firstly, the southeast part (3x2m) of L18 was 10cm because on Aug 11 we could not finish the digging of this area. After that, L16 was taken a new locus number, L21 and also L18 was taken number 20, L20 because between them there was a wall so they were different surfaces. Firstly, we began to dig L21 10cm. On this area, we found a grindstone (KT 14; 570.27; the northeast part of L20); a broken jar pieces (KT4; the northeast part of L20); a big jar piece (KT15; 570.33; the southeast part of L20); a pottery (it has a cylinder shape and I don_Ñét know for what was it used; KT5; 570.48) and also we found lots of pottery pieces, some big stones, a brick and shells. After digging this area, we took up the stones of the wall (L19). There were 2 grindstones; one of them was on the north part of L19 (KT8; 570.56), the other was on the south part of L19 (KT7; 570.65) and also on the south of the wall there was a mortar (KT9; 570.51). After taking up the rocks, this area was taken L22 and L22 was not rich about finds. We dug L20, 21 and 22 to take same level with L14 (the south part of the trench; 2x2m) because today was the last day of the excavation so I wanted to smooth these loci. And also we dug L7 (the middle-north of F14). It was dug 10-20cm to take same level with L20, 21, 22. There were some pieces of the same vessel (KT14; 570.36). On the face of L8 (the middle part of the trench; 7.65x1m), there were a vessel (KT50) and a bone (KT51) in it (on the north part of L8; 569.67) and a piece of pottery (on the middle part of L8; KT52; 569.65).

It was opened in the 2001 season and continued in 2002. It was dug down to approximately 598.53m in 2001 in the E and 597.22 in the W. The trench was stepped in 2001 and the W _ was left just 10cm below topsoil. This season the focus of excavation was the E portion of the trench and bringing it down to the level of the W side so that we could continue it as a full 10x10. We also wanted to see what was happening with the major architecture of the trench, like the 10m long stone wall, L3068, which was discovered last year at the end of the season.   We started the season by looking for the surface that was associated with the 10m long N-S running stone wall, L3068. We could see the foundation trench, L3074, was already visible E of the wall in L3060 and L3063, so we knew that we had already cut through the surface associated with the wall in the East. Knowing this, we searched West of the wall starting in locus L3065 and peeling off layers with trowels. There were several poorly preserved surfaces, possibly outside work surfaces or surfaces that were seasonally used. At this point I realized that the surface associated with the wall had definitely been removed in 2001 and no further surfaces were associated with the wall and so we began to take out the wall. While taking down the south-most portion of the wall, the portion that approaches the south baulk, we found a limestone doorpost, C.3.3068.6, and soon after a doorway (that is, an opening in the wall where there were no stones) with a clearly visible floor, L3074, which is a partly plastered pebble strewn surface. We did not find the termination of the wall in the North because it goes all the way into the baulk. While removing the Northern portion of the wall we found a pit, L3077, which is a pit that cuts into the wall and breaks the connection of stones between the northern and the southern parts of the wall. This is an important feature for two reasons, firstly it tells us why the stones of the wall are missing and secondly it gives us a connection with a feature from last year, the large oven that was founded on the wall, L3030.Pit L3077 is a large pit and can be seen in the section of the E baulk directly underneath the oven. We find that the soil in the pit is ashy and in the ash we found another, smaller broken oven in fragments, C.3.3077.5 &amp; 8. This is probably an earlier oven that was broken and discarded in the pit to make way for the larger oven, L3030 thatwas built later.   After taking out these two features (L3077 and L3068), there was nothing of true significance left in the east portion of the trench. All the other loci were either fill or poorly preserved surfaces that weren_Ñét connected to any architecture and were not telling us anything about the trench. This area could be an area that was not used much outside of a major building, whose west wall we caught, L3068, or this could be interim fill between occupation periods, and the material we find in the levels here are from erosional fill coming down from the top of the mound. So, with small picks, we started trying to level the trench that we would have a flat area to start working with. As we dug we noticed that there were many carbon samples coming from the E portion of the area we were digging, mostly near the baulk, L3079, L3078 and L3081. We also found a decent amount of slag samples and a piece of a lead pin C.3.3079.3.    After getting down through L3081 , a fill layer continuation of L3020 from last year, we found a couple of features that can help us interpret the trench. First we found a mud brick wall, L3083. It runs N-S and almost directly under the stone wall, L3068. Also we can see only 4 bricks and no connecting wall so we were not sure what to make of it. As we worked in the second important feature that we discovered, an ash layer L3085, we found that part of the wall was collapsed over the ash layer L3085. At first we thought that L3083 was a mud brick cap for the ash layer in order to lay the stone wall, L3068, but we found that only part of the mudbricks were collapsed over the ash layer and that the bricks continued down. Also we found that the ash layer extended a bit further than we expected because it had a thin, 1cm, layer of mud brick collapse over it. The collapse is most likely run off from L3083. The ash layer with collapse over it is L3094. We did not get to finish digging L3085 or find how far down L3083 goes, but we did find the associated surface for the wall on its east side. A small cobble surface coming out of the E baulk at the south most brick of wall 3083 had an intact, in situ piriform jar minus the handle, C.3.3091.1, lying both on it and against the wall, showing that the wall and the surface on which the jar lay were associated. Our goal for the last couple of days of excavation was to bring down all of the trench, minus the wall and what was E of the wall, to the same level so that next season it can be dug completely and comprehensively. While digging L3093, the layer designated as fill S of the ash layer, L3085, we found a large, 30cm+, slag flow coming out of the baulk. We cannot see the surface that it was associated with in section, but it seems like there was a light work surface that was there and continued W into the part of the trench that we didn_Ñét dig this season. The pottery we pulled from the area looks to be LBA. It is possible that in removing the fill that surrounded the slag with big picks, we may have collected material from an interim surface.   What we found this year is in some respects similar to what we found last season. Last year in the far eastern, mostly south eastern portion ,we found a series of broken surfaces most unconnected with and architecture. As mentioned above we found a 10m long stone wall running north-south and founded on top of that a large, square oven feature that had several different ash layers in it. In the far eastern area we also found a good amount of carbon and ash, as we did this year. West of the large stone wall we found many ephemeral, outside work-like areas and in the north western quarter we found a series of surfaces that were eroded and looked to be running downhill.   The information that pulled from the trench this year, as well as the information gained last season, leads me to believe that the area we in the central and western portions of the trench is largely an outside work area. The two walls that we found separate the E meter to two meters from the rest of the trench. They may be inside surfaces because they are in better shape than those outside the walls and are preserved better. Alternatively, the area where the smashed cooking pot and the piriform jar were found could be either an inside area, or an area of a courtyard bounded by a wall, in comparison to the area on the other side of the wall which (given the presenc eo fth eslag flow) would best be described as an outside surface. The surfaces outside (west) of the walls seem to be largely degraded and partially mixed by water. Also in the N/NW there seems to be some sort of water event that caused the surfaces to erode down hill, for instance L3094, L3088 and L3082. The outside of the wall seems to be a work area because of the multitude of animal bones, and slag present in the loci there along with many carbon sample, usually 4+ for each locus. The most convincing of these loci is L3085, the ash layer, which contained several bags worth of large bones, including an equine jaw.   Next year t would be interesting to dig the entire area looking at the work surfaces. Because the trench is no longer stepped we can see if the surfaces that were found in the W are continuous throughout the trench. Also the SE should be looked at carefully to see why there is LBA pottery coming up in L3093. Also it would be important to push down in the NW to see if we can catch the metal working contexts that are associated with the slag pits found in C2 two years ago.

We cleared the fill straight to the top of the second surface in L42, and found some reed impression just above the surface. We photographed some in situ and took a sample. We screened all of the fill in L40 looking for sub floor artifacts.       In the surface in L37 we cleaned and took a level plan shot. The articulated surface is nicely preserved with many very small colorful pebbles imbedded in the compacted fill.       Here is the process we followed in taking off the surface:   pulled off sherds slightly pedastalled, KT 13    split the sections of surface for microanalysis for Andy, samples from the east section .30m are in KT 8 and samples from the west section .60m wide are in KT 9    all left over surface area was separated into bags for artifacts and all buckets were screened, the bags for the screened artifacts were separated as well    found 3 stone blade small finds    took 2 carbon samples from the surface          We cleaned the surface off and found fill beneath it. We extended L40 to encompass all of the fill below the floor in L37. We cleared the fill in L40 to the top of L42 new surface. In the section it appeared that L40 may have been mud brick debris but it was not visible as we dug. L42 is a sloping surface that moves up hill west. There are only a cm or 2 of fill between L37 and L42 at the NW corner. I was concerned that these were the same surfaces that eroded down the slope but there was fill separating them.       In L36 we cleared some of the hard fill and cleaned up to see if there may be mudbricks in section. We can see some dark red areas and the fill appears to be mud brick.       For L39 I drew the final plan of the cobble foundation of the mud brick wall on my dayplan for 8/13/02 and started taking up the cobbles. We left one large conglomerate rock in situ because it was deep in the baulk. We scraped the area and changed locus to L41 as fill below the pedastalled wall. We cleared L41 all the way to the level of L34 and then changed to L34 as a continuation of the fill south of the level of the surface L37. The 2 pedastalled cobbles north of L37 were added to L38 as part of the thin red mud brick wall we cut down yesterday. The cobbles are probably part of a foundation for the wall. We shaved off the fill that looked like melted mud brick and then changed to L41 as the fill below the wall L39. We cleared this to the level of L34 and found that the surface continues below the fill L41.       It is my suspicion that the walls in L39 and L38 are part of the same wall that has eroded down the tepe, judging from the view in the west section of multicolored bricks melting down the slope of the tepe. I also believe that the fill below those walls in L41 is part of an earlier phase of construction that continues next to the surface in L37 and L42. After clearing these walls in L39 and L38 and the fill below them, L41, we found that there were darker areas of fill that looked like mudbricks. But when we sprayed it was not as clear. I have marked on my day plan where I think these areas of mud brick are and they are directly below the previous walls except that the west quarter of the surface extends further south than the previous surfaces L30 and L32 did. I think the wall extends to the east baulk and makes a corner against the west border of the surface L37 which explains why the surface stops so abruptly at L36. There may have been a pit which cut the east border of the wall which explains the soft mixed fill found in L36. The hard fill left in L37 after we cleared the soft fill resembles crumbled mud brick.       To confirm my theory about the wall that extends form the west baulk to the east baulk, I cut sections on the south side of the areas that looked like mud brick. We took the rest of the fill down about .10m to see if I could see the bricks in profile. We did this at the end of the day and it was difficult to see the results. We must do further scraping and spraying in the area to see if there are bricks.     ,~: A-9-2002-08-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9/Locus 1,"964,2002-08-15," F-1-2002-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1069,","   F1JP08152002   Daily Trench Summary   Area F, Trench 1   August 15, 2002      This was a half day today here on the Tepe. We basically had two different areas where we were pushing down to better understand.      We spent a good amount of time trying to better articulate the new cobble surface 1100 that had showed up directly underneath the cobble pathway L1086. It was not as long though, as it went for about two meters beginning at the N baulk and going towards the S along the E baulk. Plus the cobbles are smaller. We articulated these cobbles and found where they stopped as far as they went to the south, but we didn_Ñét have time to articulate them fully to the W which means they may continue for a small distance there.       We also began the day by pushing down in the filly area L1095 where there were several large rocks appearing. We were surprised to find that mostly directly underneath these large rocks was a cobble surface. We actually think that this cobble surface may be cobble slump off of a former rock wall or something like this, since the large rocks are part of these smaller cobbles.       There were no significant finds on this day, except for the articulation of these surfaces. We then were done for the day.     ,~: F-1-2002-08-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1069,"965,2002-08-17," D-6-2002-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 4,","   Trench D6 Daily August 17, 2002      Please note: Dayplans C, D, E and F for today show views of the furnace removal, with labels for each KT      Our goals for today were to remove and document as much of furnace L20 as possible. Note that L20 is defined as the structure of the furnace itself, and that L24-28 refer to the contents of their respective chamber. This means all KT will be classified under L20, although we used the 20/XX caption when possible to provide more accessible explanation.      L20/28 extreme N wall      Next we proceeded to dismantle the north wall of L20/28. It followed much the same pattern as above. Again we noted brick lines in the abutting structure (Kts 43, 44, 45) although the bottom brick (45) was much less coherent than the other two and gave the impression of being bonded to the surface below. We later removed the hard baked lining of L28 which was extremely similar in nature to that in L24. Low on this wall we noted an ash course under KT52. Also note there is a mudbrick extension of L14 that abuts L20, and that this extension joins cleanly, and that the areas to the East and West of this joint are distinctly different (East- mixed debri-ish, West- hard mudbricky with little variation)      L20/28 South wall      The south wall of L20/28 (North wall of 27) was partially destroyed on th 15th, and what remained was of much less distinct character (less organized and well formed bricks than found elsewhere). The bottom brick of this wall extension rested directly on the crossbeam brick (KTs 72 and 73), which we removed to finally expose the crackle slag (73)on the ceiling of the cubbyhole/chamber in L27. It is interesting to note that we found no sign of any channel for this slag. It is possible that it leaked through cracks between the m.b.s or that it splashed up from below. We did not get a chance to thoroughly examine this brick in the field to discern further evidence for these theories.      L20/27 South wall      The South wall of L20/27 (North wall L20/L26) consisted of very hard bricks, the uppermost being of well defined rectangular shape and those underneath of random shape. This pattern seems to be consistent with what we are discovering about the furnace. Ie, that certain areas are very carefully constructed from regular defines pieces, and that other, generally supporting elements consist of mixed and irregular material, or even fill (as we_Ñéll get to with the Western wall of L20, but I_Ñém getting ahead of myself).      L20/26 South wall      We removed a large, non consolidated piece from this area today. It is my belief that more well formed upper bricks were missing or previously removed.      L20/24- extreme S wall      The South came apart as large solid bricks. They were primarily bonded by the slag on their face, and did not appear to have any significant mortar. The bricks ranged dramatically insize and shape, and appear to be custom built for their position. There did not appear to be a continuation of fired bricks in the back (West) wall of L20, but rather that the bricks (KTs22, 26, 29, etc) abutted mixed/hard soil. In the interior of L24 there was a very definite ~3 cm hard fired lining (orangish in color) which also abutted the soil matrix of this West wall. As we were continuing down we removed the large stone sitting on the support buttress KT 27 (really part of L23-oops) and then removed the buttress itself, noting very well defined brick lines and a clean join between these bricks and the South wall of L20. We also noted that the pottery just to the East of this pillar (above KT33) continued through the South wall of L20, extending out to the South about 6 cm, providing further evidence for some abutting structure to the south. Finally we noted a direct foundation and connecting bricks (with a clean joint) between L20 and L14.      L20 West (back) wall      We removed the upper portions of this all the way across L20. It consisted of hard but mixed material (not bricks0 and previously had a solid regular mb cap above this material. We worked down to the level where the pottery lined slopes in chambers 25 and 27 begin, noting continued mixed material and evidence of more rocks.      L6      We started removing the wall portion of L6 today, finding extremely friable hard brittle material that broke into bricklike pieces (although only a few cm thick).This area as clearly been exposed to fire. This removal revealed that wall Lb30 continues under a portion of the wall of L6. Also to be noted is an area of very much ash near the bottom of the pit L6. It is becoming apparent that this pit extends further to the north than we have currently excavated it.           ,~: D-6-2002-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 4,"966,2002-08-17," B-4-2002-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 4/Locus 4058,","   B4JP08172002   Daily Trench    Area B, Trench 4   August 17, 2002      Today we made a push to finish the trench by reaching the B1 surface that we hope extends into the northwestern quadrant of B4. We were successful in reaching a surface but it is of a different character than the surface in B1. Instead of a surface comprised of pebbles, cobbles and potsherds with debris littered upon it, we found a simple earthen surface with scattered debris. This debris, lying flat a similar level, betrayed the surface interface. The following paragraphs detail the excavation of this debris.       At the start of today the trench was at two levels: the southern half was previously excavated to the base of the debris, while the northern half was about 10 _ÑÐ 20cm above this surface. Thus, we removed L4058 as variable mudbrick and occupational debris fill in the northern half of the trench. We excavated this locus in two levels with separate find bags to maintain tighter control over artifacts. The first 5 _ÑÐ 10cm were removed as KT bags 4058.8 _ÑÐ 4059.11, while the second 5 _ÑÐ 10cm were removed as KT bags 4058.12-14. At the base of the second level of L4058, the trench was essentially level, and the debris was in part lying flat on the surface and in part pedestaled in selected areas where concentrations of stones and artifacts were found (for example, the center of the trench). We removed these artifacts as L4059, defined as debris on the surface, new locus L4061. L4061, the beaten earth surface on which the debris lay, was not excavated but left at the base of the trench. I believe it is not a prepared surface but rather an interface between two kinds of fill that became a beaten earth surface when it was used for habitation and activities. L4059 on the other hand was completely removed. All artifacts were given KT numbers, elevations, photographed and removed. No ceramics were found lying flat on the surface, but several sherds and bones were embedded in and under the pile of debris in the center of the trench and around other stones or small finds removed from the surface. The concentration of debris in the center of the trench included several stones and a few broken grindstones. In total, 8 small finds were recovered from the surface, including:      4059.4: basalt grindstone fragment: floating in debris above the surface   4059.5: basalt grindstone fragment: floating in debris above the surface   4059.6: non-basalt grindstone fragment: mixed with debris near the center of the trench on the surface   4059.7: hammerstone: floating in debris on the eastern side of the trench next to the baulk.    4059.8: basalt bowl or grindstone fragment: lying on the surface in the southern half of the quadrant   4059.9: door post of mortar lying flat on the surface near the southern baulk   4059.10: portion of round basalt weight with hole through the middle. (donut shaped). Lying on the surface in the southern half of the trench.   4059.11: non basalt stone that may be a grindstone. Lying on the surfacenear the center of the trench.       _ÑÉOn_Ñé versus _ÑÉAbove_Ñé the surface:      In the above descriptions, I have noted  the artifacts were lying flush on the surface or were somewhat pedestaled in the debris layer. Given that the surface is earthen, and the debris was fairly uneven both in elevation and extent, it is difficult to separate the debris _ÑÉabove_Ñé the surface from that lying directly ON the surface. I have tried to highlight those objects most closely associated with the surface, namely 4059.9, 4059.8 and 4059.10.       A note about L4059 and L4061      I created L4059 in an attempt to isolate those artifacts lying on the surface, as distinctive from the debris above the surface, which may have accumulated after the surface was out of use. In truth, due to the uneven nature of the debris, much of L4059 should be equal to L4058 and be labeled debris above/accumulated on surface. Nevertheless this distinction is useful for isolating that material most closely associated with the surface.       L4061 was created as the surface itself, but was not excavated because we are pressed for time and it appears that we have reached the same level as the B1 surface that we sought. Either we lack a few centimeters before we reach this surface, or it continues into this portion of the trench as an earthen surface of a different character. The answer will have to come in year 2003.       Wall L4060      When removing L4058 we identified a possible mudbrick wall in the NE corner of the area we are excavating. This area of hard brick seems to run SE _ÑÐ NW and just barely clips the trench exposing about 1m X 0.25cm of itself.       Final Note       All stones/debris were drawn on the plan, and the NW corner of the trench was accurately mapped for the first time today. Trench dimensions from the previous day do not reflect the actual position of baulks and elevation boundaries. Refer to today_Ñés plan if concerned about these borders on August 14. Also, L4014 from the 2001 season, stones in the SE corner of the NW quadrant of B4, were left unexcavated and pedestaled.            ,~: B-4-2002-08-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 4/Locus 4058,"967,2002-08-19," D-6-2002-08-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 4,","   Trench D6 Daily August 19, 2002      Our main goals for today were to remove as much of the L20 complex (L20, 24-28, 5, 6, 14, 10, 16) as possible with as much detail as possible and to remove and document all slag from these areas.       L20/chamber 27   We continued down (having not finished yesterday), first finding another layer of pottery in similar orientation under the one previously visible on the top of L20/27, and then continuing down. The pillar of the structure of chamber 27 was built of exterior mudbrick walls and filled with unconsolidated but very hard fill.      L46   We designated L46 as the surface found under South portion of wall L5. This surface continued through the wall of L5, and gave evidence that L5 is the wall of a pit, baked hard and slag covered. L46 is very similar to the other surfaces we have found, although we cannot see very much of it.      L47   We designated L47 as the curving line of rocks extending from the back (NW corner) of L20 out to the N and W. It consists of mixed stones founded on mudbricks, just above L48.       L48   L48 is the large pile of rocks directly beneath L47. It_Ñés fairly disorganized but might be the end of a large wall with 3 rows running towards the West, although half a meter square is not much to go by.      L16   We removed the first course of large stones finding about 5cm of mudbricky fill before the lower course of smaller stones. We then removed these finding a hard light mudbricky material (L52) and the continuation of surface 30.       L10   We removed the rocks of L10, and also discovered that they continue into L20, terminating under chamber L25. This row of rocks does not quit line up with those in L27 and across, although it_Ñés still possible this is the same wall as L16.      L14 and L44   We designated L44 as the mudbrick etc collapse between what appeared to be a grey continuation of the wall from L20 and more consolidated material to the south. We at first believed it to be the North wall of L14 itself or that it was collapse jut inside that wall, but instead learned that it was probably debri inside the larger furnace structure of L20. I still have belief that the upper portions of L14 were used as a small single chamber furnace, perhaps after the large L20/L14/L6 unit was abandoned, but this will be up to further investigation to determine.      L23   We briefly revisited this locus to remove the southern buttress from L20, and did not notice any mudbrick structure here at all, surprisingly.      L20/27/50   A biggie. We continued to push down and clean all around, and realized that there was material blocking the front of the front wall of L27. We had not noticed this before as it had appeared that the walls of L20 extended onto this fill. It may be that they did at some stage of the furnaces use life, but that it also once extended down further into the pit L29 area. We excavated this new material as L50 quickly (in one stage) to reveal the front wall of L27 covered in a variety of slag in a very similar manner to that on L25. We however left the material from L50 to the north (and east) of this area (In front of the junction between l20 and L6 to be excavated next year, the idea being that we may have more questions to answer, and having some part intact may be a good idea. There appears to be much slag in the area. This locus may appear confusing on the dayplans as it was designated and excavated so quickly. It begins in front of L27, extending out to the \bottleneck\ between L29 and pit L6 (east of chamber/wall L6).      L20 slag removal   At the end of the day we began removal of all the slag on the walls of L20 and continuing down into pit L29 (although classified as KTs from L20, as there was no break in the material from the upper portions to the lower. We documented elevations and locations through marking printouts of photographs to document this removal. The material was extremely hard and underneath we found soil of amazing reds and browns, very mixed.     ,~: D-6-2002-08-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 4,"968,2002-08-19," D-5-2002-08-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5104,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 5   August 19, 2002      I went to the field today to close down the trench and answer some final questions. Specifically, I wanted to again check in on the nature of the thought-to-be S wall of the mudbrick structure, L5104. After mostly removing it, it is clear in the section that there is a cut-out part of the wall abutting against N-S wall L5139 and continuing some 50 cm to the E until the wall begins again. This is so clear due to a layer of grain, similar to that on the N of the structure (L5098) which can be seen filling this gap. There is mudbrick above that layer, but it appears to be melt from the two walls around the doorway/step.   The other major question was the nature of the hard surface (L5148) to the N of the structure and their relation. We were able to trace the surface, some areas of which are plastered, to near the wall (though below its footing) and abutting against WSW oven/floor-reuse L5149. Thus, the final conclusion (for this season) is that the grain surface is contemporary with the structure but that the WSW oven (when used as an oven) and floor L5148 predate the structure.   Also of note, when removing flat-laying pottery in N-central Ubaid surface locus L5138 I uncovered an extensive pot smash which would certainly lend itself well to reconstruction (KT 5138.2).   As final activities, I had my workers clean the sections for drawing and took closing elevations.     ,~: D-5-2002-08-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5104,"969,2002-08-21," F-1-2002-08-21-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,","F-1-2002   F1TRENCHSUMMARY2002   Final Trench Summary 2002   Area F, Trench 1   August 21, 2002      I- Introduction      F1 is a trench located in Area F of the Upper Tigris Archaeological Research Project being conducted at Kenan Tepe. Area F is located on the lower mound of the research project. Trench 1 is located on the south side of the lower mound, near the drop off towards the river. Just to the SE of F1, going down the slope towards the river, is completely excavated trench F4. The closest trenches to the N are F9 and F13, which are nowhere near as close as F4.       F1 is a 5m x 5m trench. Actual dimensions of excavation started out at 4m x 4m, although with baulks being cut back the dimensions of the trench for this season ended up being 4.45 m from N to S and 4.10 m from E to W. The trench began the season with an average bottom depth of 568.20 m. At season_Ñés end the trench had reached an average bottom elevation of 567.45. In other words, most of the trench was excavated about 75 cm this season. This season was the continuation of 2 season_Ñés worth of excavation. In the 2000 season excavation on the trench began for the last couple of weeks of the season, while in 2001 the trench was open most of the season. This is my 2nd year running the trench, as I was also trench supervisor in 2001.      Goals for the season were to better establish the time period of the trench. Early results and analysis from last season had led to the belief that a large ashy layer L1037, excavated last season, which capped this season_Ñés artifacts was a possible destruction layer which divided the trench_Ñés 3rd Millennium Era with that of the Late Chalcolithic. We also wanted to be able to continue down to the stratigraphic layers that are equal to the large oven in trench F4, since this oven and associated artifacts have been firmly established as Chalcolithic. We were not quite able to match up this trench with the oven of F4 this year, although this is certainly an easily attainable goal for next season, as we don_Ñét believe we are more than 50 cm from being on the same stratigraphic layer.      II- 2002 Excavation      Last season_Ñés excavation had left us with the remains of a large black ashy layer that covered the entire trench. The ash was left by an oven which was in the center of the trench. These two loci, 1037 and 1045, had been excavated by the end of last season. Still, as we started out this season we had the remains of the soil from underneath the oven, which we did not believe was part of the oven, as well as a hard packed whitish surface that we postulate is where the black ash came to rest. We had excavated some of this surface last year, but there was still a lot of it left. Last year we had also dug a pit down to an elevation 40 cm below the surface of where we were and had hit the end of the pit with some cobbles. With this knowledge we went to work.       We started excavating L1060, a hard baked surface or fill layer which stayed as the same material for about 20 cm. At the same stratigraphic layer we had a hard packed area 1061 in the SE corner which we started as a mini sounding to try to see if the cobbles continued towards the E baulk. These cobbles were L1057. They did not become an active part of the trench until later. We also started the season with the fill from underneath the former oven and the former oven walls. These were loci 1058 and 1059 respectively. These loci ended up merging with other loci, in the case of 1058 it was never excavated as 1058, once the fill around it was level with it we made new loci.      About this time, early in the season, we were having difficulty getting in and out of our trench. We made a step by cutting into the NW until we hit some cobbles, about 70 cm. This was 1062.      In the SE corner of the trench we started a very small locus of an ashy layer that ended up lasting only about one cm. This ash lens was 1063. We also had a hard fill layer under this ash lens which was L1064. These were both located in the far SE corner of the trench and were only .77 x .31 meters.      One of the major problems with the trench this year was the lack of identifiable context for a long time in the trench. As one can see we were pretty much going through fill layers at this point hoping that eventually we would come across a good context. We tried our best to understand what was going on in the trench, when in retrospect nothing was making sense because all of what we were digging through was either mudbrick fill or mudbrick slump. Occasionally we would run into things that we hoped were mudbrick walls that would appear to have promise, but in the end we would be left without any greater contexts until we reached the cobble surface L1057 and the areas lower than that.       In the middle of the trench we ran into an area which we hoped was a pit, although the area wasn_Ñét especially ashy, it was just browner than the light brown dirt we had been excavating. We excavated this locus as 1065. Next to 1065 we found some more fill which was browner than the light brown hard pack 1060. This was a little different, so we excavated it as 1066. In this locus we did find a cool black bead which was F.1.1066.3. Around this area we also ran into a black ashy area which unfortunately only lasted one cm before ending. Underneath 1065 we ran into a hard area we excavated as 1068. All of these loci were all in the E half near the middle of the trench.      About this same time we were making new fill loci 1070 and 1071. They were large fill loci that were probably equal to each other that didn_Ñét have very good context. Around this same level we had fill locus 1074. 1074 appeared to be more of a clay locus, but it didn_Ñét look flat or ed enough to be a surface. We also excavated another fill locus 1072 which was located in the NE corner of the trench.      Around this stratigraphic layer we found what we believed to be three mudbrick walls in the trench. An examination of these three loci will show some of the problems that we had this year in our excavation. When things are mudbrick walls we are only able to identify them by their change in color, as some mudbrick is a reddish color to contrast with the brown of the trench. On the other hand there are mudbricks which end up the same color as the dirt around it, which makes it very difficult to find, unless there are clear and distinct lines. In 2002 in F1 this was no guarantee of finding a wall, as there may have been many pavements being constructed or laid out with mudbricks in this area. 1069 was a red mudbrick area which we found in the SE corner of the trench which we hoped to be a wall. L1072 was found coming out at an angle from the N baulk and going towards the S baulk. L1076 was another reddish mudbrick area in the SE corner that we thought might connect with L1069. Because of how the excavation proceeded we dealt with 1073 and 1076 first. In the section it looks as though 1073 is only one course high. We realized it was only a pavement and removed it. L1076 was actually laying upon an ashy surface, later to be excavated as L1077 and L1094, so we realized this could not be a wall. After realizing this we looked at 1069 and figured that it was not a wall and was also a pavement. Even looking at the walls of the locus we could not see the wall continuing. So we dug down about 30 cm in excavating this \wall\ and we were surprised to see that it was a wall. This wall still continues to this day and appears to be contemporary with the better contexts of this year, which we still have not talked about in this summary.       We thought that we were reaching a context when we excavated a pit 1075. This pit area may have actually been a black ashy layer of fill or something like that, or it may have been a pit. We began by only excavating about half of this layer, because we thought this is where it ended. Meanwhile, on the other side of the wall 1069 we were also excavating an ashy layer which comes right up to the wall L1069, a layer that was excavated as two different loci 1077 and 1094. 1094 is the area which was directly underneath 1076, a mudbrick pavement that we left for a while in the trench while we dug down in other areas.      Also around this stratigraphic layer we had a large fill layer which basically was taking up the entire W half of the trench. This was fill locus 1078. This fill was basically a replacement for 1071 because it had been in the trench for awhile. One day we encountered two easily identifiable straight lines in this locus. We thought that we had come up with a wall. It was unfortunately the color of the dirt around it, so we couldn_Ñét see it anywhere except through these two lines. Nevertheless, this \wall\ became 1080. Around the same time we had a weird small hard plaster thing next to the S baulk that was 1079. No insight into this weird hard dirt anomaly was ever acquired.      Since we thought that we had found a new wall we divided the trench and made the area to the S of the wall 1082 and the area to the N 1083. We didn_Ñét use 1081 because it had been taken by the discovery of some interesting slag coming out of the baulk during baulk cleaning and straightening. Once again though, we were looking for things and dividing up loci without any actual knowledge that things were different. We were hoping that we had picked out a wall, but later knowledge would show that this also was probably just mudbrick slump or several mudbricks in a pavement lined up in a row.       Up to this point in this year_Ñés excavation we had tried to peel off a small amount of dirt at a time, trying to be careful. This was not so much because we were in an important context, but more because we were trying to understand what exact type of context we were in. Looking back now I would say that it was a mistake for us to continue digging 5 cm at a time and then cleaning up and looking around for a way to make sense out of all of the hard fill areas which we dug through this year. We probably should have just done what we ended up doing to this stratagraphic layer, which was to bring out the big pick and go down 10 to 15 cm at a time until we hit a good context to work with.      We took the big pick out in L1082 to see if the original cobble surface of the year, 1057, would continue underneath this locus. Somewhat disappointingly it continued for only about 20 more cm until it disappeared. While we were big picking in a large fill area in the NE corner of the trench, L1085, we hit into another cobble surface which we began excavating as 1086. This cobble surface ended up being a thin (50 to 70 cm) cobble surface which spanned the entire length of the trench, from the NE corner to the S baulk. From this point on we think that we were actually in some pretty good context. This cobble surface ended up connecting with a cobble surface which was about 10 cm underneath the original cobbles of the season 1057. When we removed 1057 we removed all of the dirt and screened everything. In 1057 we did find another fun little small find, a bone awl or needle, KT 7 of L1057.       We had sectioned the \wall\ 1080 to see if it continued or if the 1057 continued. It didn_Ñét appear that either one did. This small sectioning was 1088. Fill underneath the cobbles 1057 when it was removed was 1087. Directly underneath this fill was where 1086 went all the way across the trench.      Our change to big picking ended with the excavation of these cobbles and what we believe to be a surface that went with these cobbles, 1089. 1089 is actually a tough locus to figure out, because originally we felt as though not only did it go with a cobble surface but it also went with an oven 1090 which we had discovered, along with oven wall 1091. This oven proved to be less exciting than we thought it was going to be, as the black ash area of the oven ended a mere 2 to 3 cm after excavation had started. In addition there were no bricks, just hard baked orange dirt from heat. This oven appears to have been intentionally razed by the inhabitants of the area. As I had indicated, early indications were that this oven went with surface 1089. But in the end we uncovered another surface just underneath 1089 which is 1098. 1098 is a great flat surface with black burned areas on it. Next to this surface we had fill locus 1095 to the south and a new mudbrick wall 1096 to the E. We actually think that 1096 was a wall, but that it was only contemporary with these surfaces.       Two fill loci next to 1086 which didn_Ñét have much effect were 1099 and 1093. Then we had more cobbles surfaces show up underneath 1086, 1097 in roughly the same place where 1057 had been, a smaller cobble surface, and 1100 a surface which didn_Ñét have quite as many cobbles, so the fill and the cobbles were excavated together. Coming up in 1095 we had many large rocks. We wanted to figure out how these large rocks went together and we went down on this area and ran into some cobbles. It appears that this area 1101 is more of a slump-like area than the other cobbles we have come up with this season.    When we excavated 1098 we had found a jar rim which appeared to be complete which we theorized was buried in this surface. We were probably correct, as this pottery jar was a complete jar which we were able to excavate on the last day of excavation this season. We had to make a recovery locus 1103 to be able to fully extract. The jar is KT5 of L1103. Lastly, we removed the wall 1096 on the last day of excavation and ran into a new cobble surface with a very large rock on one side near the N baulk and cobbles which were about twice as big as the other cobble surfaces we have had. It went out for about a meter from the N baulk. We named this new locus 1104 and then closed it because we had finished our excavation for the season.      We have drawn the E baulk so far this year. We added this year_Ñés excavations to last year_Ñés baulk drawing. There is also talk of others drawing another baulk after I have left, but I am not sure which baulk that would be. In the baulk that we drew you can see clearly that there appear to just be different fill loci of differing colors until you reach the wall L1069 which shows up very clearly in section. Below the different fill layers are the cobbles which were part of 1086 and 1100 as well. Other sections tend to show what I have tried to describe, fill with an occasional clear mudbrick in section and occasional easy to spot mudbrick debris. And it shows that evey other mudbrick wall we encountered this year was a pavement.      III- Interpretation and Musings Upon F1      As stated earlier, one of the problems with this trench this year is that we spent a lot of time trying to understand areas that in retrospect appear to be mudbrick fill or slump, or merely fill. We dug down a little at a time, looked for lines, and looked for context where it looks like there was no context. We probably should have taken out the big pick a little earlier to look for a context that we could work with.       The last context that we had is probably the only example of a good context this year. We have a very good surface and a mudbrick wall which bounds that surface on the E side. In addition, the cobble pathway appears to be somewhat raised from the surface, but a difference of 5 or 10 cm could easily still be part of the same surface. In addition, the cobble 1101 slump fill may be slump from a former wall which would have bounded this surface on the S side. Especially if the original wall fell over towards the south then the large rocks and the cobbles which fell over would have originally been near the buried jar, which would have put the jar in one corner of the area. It is still very difficult to tell whether or not this is a domestic area, although the lack of large amounts of artifacts all season would seem to indicate that it was more probably a work area.      Early analysis of this trench_Ñés artifacts from this season seem to indicate that we are in the Chalcolithic period. This would make this the third oldest trench on the Tepe, as F4, which is right next to F1, has gone down further and D5 has had the discovery of Ubaid period pottery, which is earlier than the late Chalcolithic of area F. Still, this trench is important because it is one of the first chances that we have to look at the Chalcolithic era. While there were not a great deal of interesting contexts this year, the one context that we did have is interesting to interpret.      IV _ÑÐ Loose Ends      Actually, as we come to a close it appears that a lot of the best context from this season will undoubtedly continue next season. There are still various cobbles laying around, including 1101 the cobble slump with large rocks in it, 1100, fill will cobbles in it and near the E baulk, and new larger cobble surface 1104. This should be very interesting for the next excavator to look at. In addition, L1069, the wall in the SE corner of the trench appears to continue. I did not finish excavating these cobble surfaces completely, or even start in the case of 1101 and 1104.       Finally, it is also important to note the relative proclivity that this trench has to F4. Next year the trench should be at the same elevations as the super oven L4023 from F4. While it does not appear that the oven is large enough to actually be within the trench it should be interesting to see if there are any other signs of work areas near the giant oven.      I wish whoever takes over this trench next year the best of luck.

The trench was laid out as a 5x5 but we initially dug a 4x1 meter test strip running north to south. The boundaries of the trench encompassed the area of G4. Our plan was to push this area down in a rapid but careful fashion, using the section of the sounding as our guide, until we reached the surface we assumed the burial was dug into. There was hard mudbrick in the section of G4 that was to be our guide when we knew we were getting close to the level of the jar burial. We were unable to reach this goal due to the ups and downs of the field season, but we were able to exhume a different burial and get the trench in prime position for removal of the jar burial next season.      Since the trench was dug as a 1x4 it is important to note that locus 1 was not closed until the end of the season. Locus 1 was topsoil. We assumed we would expand the trench once we hit the good context of the burial. As a result of this assumption we left locus 1 open so when we removed the topsoil in the entire 5x5 it would all have the same locus. We thought that having 3 or 4 loci all of topsoil with different locus numbers, especially loci with higher numbers, which would tend to indicate older contexts and lower elevations, would be unnecessarily confusing. (Much as that sentence just was.) Unfortunately we were not able to expand and thus locus 1 was left in a limbo state. This is indicated in the database by the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast elevations being the same as the opening elevations whereas the center elevations are the elevation at which Locus 2 was opened. Locus 1 was very rich in pottery.      Locus 2 was opened below when the soil changed from light brown to a darker brown and the texture shifted from the loamy topsoil into a more clayey composition. This was at a fairly high elevation, much higher than I expected the topsoil to end. It is sub-topsoil and despite its difference in soil texture from the topsoil is still not a good context. The soil exhibited some of the white pebble areas that we associate with the virgin soil and redeposited virgin soil of the area. This locus went rather deep and stopped when three new areas appeared. There was a core in with the lithics, but other than that no exceptional or unusual finds. There was a lot of pottery collected, however.      Locus 3 was the northern end of the 1x4 meter strip below Locus 2. This was an area of mudbrick wash/slump that we originally took to be a wall. The top portion was chunky and looked like the top of an eroded wall, but upon sectioning and checking for brick lines this was not the case. A few isolated bricks could be identified, but they were not a wall or any type of formal structure. This may indicate the presence of a wall that is slumping in an unexcavated portion of the trench. This locus was closed when we reached Locus 6 the final locus excavated this season. The soil changed to a medium packed silt loam. Most likely it changed at a slightly higher excavation. All the loci opened under Locus 2 stopped at about the same elevations. This change was made on a day when several excavators were helping run the trench so their opening elevations may be slightly incorrect.      Locus 4 was an ashy pit that was located in the central portion of the 1x4 meter strip. It cut the mudbrick slump, Locus 3, which is to its north. It also cut the fill located to the south, which is Locus 5. It was a very shallow pit. It too ended at the silt loam of Locus 6. Again no fantastic finds, but we did recover some shell from the area, which we had not found any of up until that time.      Locus 5 was an area of soft packed silt loam. It contained some of the white pebbles found in the virgin soil and also found in Locus 2, which is above this locus. Due to the texture change I felt comfortable in opening a new locus. This fill ended at Locus 6, which was a harder packed silt loam. It was felt that this change in soil density warranted the change to the new locus. An obsidian flake was found in this locus.      Locus 6 spanned the entire 1x4 meter area of the trench. It was a medium packed silt loam that broke down into very fine particles. A sun disk small find was located in this locus, KT 7, in the southern end. It was not quite in the burial pit of Locus 8, but it was only 3 cm above the elevation of the burial. While excavating the southern end of Locus 6 we happened upon some large bones that one of the workmen broke. Upon examining that bone it turned out to be a distal humerus. Unfortunately in the meantime pieces of human bone were probably mixed into the animal bone bag. I opened a new bag immediately for the piece of human bone and attempted to locate some human fragments in the animal bone bag, but there may be mixed pieces of both human and animal in both bags. As we discovered with sweeping and cleaning there was other human bone present in the ground, i.e. a rather robust ulna, we knew we had a burial, Locus 8. Since the burial was located in the center of the trench we realized we would have to make a cut down on both the east and the west to ensure that if it was a lying out fully and not flexed we could remove its full extent.      Locus 7 was the cut in the west. We took out a 1.5m by 1.10 m section. The 1.5 meters took us to the west baulk. There were no lithics found in this cut.      Locus 9 was the cut in the east. It too extended 1.5m, taking us to the east baulk. It was only .77m wide. We had to leave a baulk between the cut and the G4 sounding, which is located inside the boundaries of the trench. No lithics were found in this cut either.      Locus 8 was the burial. It was a very robust male. He was placed in a flexed position head to the east and feet to the west. His face was turned to the south. He was in a poor state of preservation. Several different persons including myself and two members specifically from our bone team excavated him.      Loci 10, 11, and 12 were all unexcavated. Locus 10 was the area below the cut of Locus7, Locus 11 is the area below the burial pit and Locus 12 is the area below the cut of Locus 9.     ,~: G-6-2002-08-021-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 6,"971,2002-08-21," B-4-2002-08-021-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area B/Trench 4,","B-4-2002   B4 TrenchSummary2002.doc   Final Trench Summary   Area B, Trench 4   August 21 2002      As only a week and a half of excavation took place in B4 this year, this summary is a brief note rather than a full recounting of the work in the trench.      With the goal of reaching an early Iron Age surface first uncovered in B1 in year 2000 we excavated in the NW and SE quadrant of B4. NO WORK TOOK PLACE IN THE NE QUADRANT. The working the SE quadrant consisted of removing mixed ash, mud brick and debris loci towards the level of the surface. We also removed several stone features, either walls or surfaces or debris, initially discovered in 2001 but not documented until this year. We took a spider shot of these surfaces before removing them. The soil beneath each stone feature was excavated separately as sealed loci. Unfortunately, a surface beneath feature L 4038 was missed, and the last few debris loci likely mixed some upcoming features. These upcoming features include a probable pit in the SE, NE and SW corner of the SE quadrant, and a possible mud brick wall in the SE corner of the SE quadrant. The rest of the trench appears to be a continuation of mixed ash and mud brick debris fill. These upcoming features were not given new locus numbers because they are poorly defined at this tie, but their locations are approximated on the final plan. Additionally, a burial along the eastern baulk, L4034, was pedestaled rather than excavated. A skull was found during the excavation of the pit so we stopped to leave this project for a future year.       After failing to reach a well-preserved surface in the SE quadrant of B4, we moved to the NW quadrant of B4, where we removed one cleaning locus and 2 debris loci above a beaten earth surface L4061. In the process we uncovered a probable mud brick wall in the NE corner, L4060, and left rock feature L4014, discovered in year 2001, pedestaled in the SE corner. The beaten earth surface L4061 appears to be the continuation of the B1 surface but is different in character. See  entry on August 17 for more information on this surface.       Note on the final plan: The final plan was made in a somewhat hasty fashion, but should approximate the location of upcoming features in the SE quadrant, as well as the trench dimensions. Yet it should be used only as a guide for re-measuring the entire trench before it is next excavated. The NE quadrant was not excavated this season, so the next excavator should refer to the August 19 2001 final trench plan for information on this part of the trench.

The basic conclusions from the work this week is that the S mudbrick structure is positively linked to the grain surface and all the collapse atop the grain surface is contemporary and oven L5111 is probably contemporary, though the latter assumption still requires further testing.   Also done this week was extensive work on a later, probably 2nd-millenium pit which looks to cut the Ubaid contexts in the WNW portion of the trench. If such can be said, it is an excellent pit, with a plaster lining, tons of pottery, some good small finds and large bones with gnawing damage. It appears near the end of the week that we were finally approaching the end of this very deep pit.   Loci sieved this week were: L5099, L5100, L5103, L5108 and L5098.        ,~: D-5-2002-08-021-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"973,2002-08-21,,"D-5-2002   Final Trench Summary, Kenan Tepe 2002   Area D   Trench 5   August 21, 2002      Introduction      Following the late discovery of the mudbrick house last season and subsequent digging in almost exclusively in the southern reaches of the trench, an early focus this year was to get the remaining two thirds of the trench down to similar levels that we might see if we could find any further contexts linked to the structure. As it turned out, we found many, all linked to the Ubaid by ceramic analysis. We discovered so much, in fact, that the majority of the season was spent doing fine excavation in these areas.   The northern third of the trench, however, managed to maintain some of its enigmatic nature as pit after pit, often cutting one another, areas of surface tumble and a human skeleton all turned up in the mix.   All-in-all it was successful, if somewhat slow, season. The western and southern baulks were drawn at the conclusion of excavations.      Ubaid Contexts      The southern two thirds of the trench were all revealed this season to be not only of an Ubaid context, but a single contemporary one. The area appears to be the interior area of a structure in the S, with the far S wall being a later addition to the structure. The central third of the trench, alternatively, appears to be an outdoor space which was used to either store or tresh grain as evidenced by a surface of compressed, decayed grain found there. And finally, along the eastern baulk, a large oven, similar to but better preserved than the one attached to the mudbrick house, was uncovered.      The Collapse      The entire area in the central-W part of the trench is occupied by a thick (as much as ~70 cm) layer of collapse made up of fill, several areas of stones and mudbrick. We began to uncover this area last season as L5066 but due to time limitations didn_Ñét get particularly far into the context. This season we were able to take the whole region down. The collapse was relatively undifferentiated, and from top to bottom excavated loci were 5079, 5094, 5097, 5099, 5100, 5103, 5108. Of note, L5099 and 5097 had higher than usual concentrations of stone, though never as articulatable architecture. L5103 contained extensive amounts of mudbrick as well, though similarly unarticulatable. The areas of unaritculatable mudbrick and stone helped lead to the conclusion that the region was all a large collapse.   One particularly interesting find that also gave credence to the collapse theory was a piece, approximately 1x1 m, of preserved fabric that was wrapped around or draped over a mudbrick (KT 5094.8, 5094.23, 5094.24, 5094.25, 5094.31, 5094.35, 5094.39, 5094.40, 5094.55). Given the pottery in the context dates to the Ubaid it is amazing the material preserved so well. That combined with the preservation of the grain surface seems to indicate a significant and large single-event collapse occurred.   Also of note, among the lithics uncovered were a large number (~40-60) of small obsidian blades.      Grain Surface      Essentially the largest single find of the season, a surface made entirely of compressed, decomposed grain was found under almost all the region of collapse. Uncovered as L5098 and excavated in four quadrants, L5042, 5043, 5044 and 5045, the surface was one to four centimeters thick and was the lynchpin linking the various Ubaid loci. In addition to containing a large number of Ubaid-type sherds itself, the surface could be seen abutting and leaning against the northern wall of the mudbrick structure (L5040, 5041) and also the western wall of the E-central oven, L5138. One odd feature of the surface was that it was completely unflat, having almost 30 cm of vertical differentiation from its highest point in the SW to its lowest in the NE. One possible explanation for its incline is that we are approaching the natural surface of the mound (indicating there was originally some level of hill there). This is not entirely implausible given that the Ubaid is the earliest context on the tepe thus far and survey hasn_Ñét revealed any indications of earlier occupation. As such, we toyed around with the idea of digging a sounding into the SW corner of the trench to look for more layers of occupation (be they Ubaid or earlier) and/or virgin soil but, in the end, the idea was nixed for now due to time constraints and the possibility of severely damaging some possibly excellent contexts.   In our last several field days we removed the grain surface and some regions of the fill beneath it (L5146) only to uncover another, earlier packed earth/plastered surface. L5148. Rather than expose it all in a half-cocked way this season, it was deemed a better idea to, after being sure of its existence, leave the full excavation until next season.   In its far northern extent, the grain surface linked to the last Ubaid context before the pits cut the area, L5132, a region of hard-packed earth surface with many flat-lying Ubaid sherds.   There was a previous, albeit smaller grain surface at a higher and more northerly location which presumably linked to the Ubaid (L5095), though its somewhat unclear. However it, like all the western Ubaid contexts, found itself cut by pit L5085.      E-central Oven      Another physically large find this season was an oven in the central-E portion of the trench. Probably having about half of its extent in the trench, the diameter appears to be around 2.5 meters with a slightly ovoid shape. The oven itself was designated L5138 and its interior fill was excavated in arbitrary layers, from top to bottom L5111, 5120, 5121, 5123, 5124 and 5127. Also within the oven was a smaller piece of architecture_ÑÓa semi-circle of burnt mudbricks, L5126, possibly a firebox or something similar due to (even for the oven) unusually high concentrations of black ash inside of it.   Aside from being associated with all the other Ubaid contexts by its connection to the grain surface, the oven is interesting in particular because it is very similar in size and design to what we were able to discover about the oven attached to the mudbrick structure last season. Though we believe both are contemporary, this one due to its association with the grain surface and the other due to its direct connection to the walls of the mudbrick structure, the latter is founded much higher, lending additional credence to the idea of the Ubaid context being built upon a slope, be it natural or coincidental to earlier occupations.   At its northern extent, the oven was cut by ash pit L5116, possibly causing some mixing.      Mudbrick Structure      Not much work was done inside the mudbrick structure this season, having uncovered what we believed to be its interior surfaces last season and having concentrated more on following its context northward. Nonetheless, some work was done inside the structure.   Firstly, we did work, first by partial and then complete excavation, to confirm the walls and their extent. What we uncovered is the following: the southern wall, L5104, appears to either be some sort of step or a later addition to the house as evidenced by the appearance of another segment of grain surface underneath it (no loci designation, only appeared within centimeters of the baulk) and there not being a direct abuttal between it and the N-S wall, L5139. In addition the western portion of the northern wall, L5142 is extant but founded upon an earlier phase of construction when there was another large oven in the WSW of the trench (L5149). The oven feature also appears to have been re-used in the currently exposed phase of the house as a surface, given its quality hard/brunt surface.   One of the minor enigmas of the season, a small plaster-lined and covered pit, L5147, was uncovered up against the east side of wall L5139 in one of the few remaining areas of the surface from last season. When excavated, the pit was only several centimeters deep and completely devoid of content. What soil was removed was taken for a float sample (KT 5147.1).      The Northern Trench      Whereas the southern part of the trench was occupied by the wonderful Ubaid context, the north was a rather confusing jumble of pits cutting pits and surface tumble. To spice things up further, a perplexing human burial and awkwardly placed human skeleton even found its way into the region.      Plaster-lined Pits      Cutting and marking an end to the Ubaid contexts was a very large plaster-lined pit, L5085. At approximately a meter and a half in depth and 1 to 2 meters in diameter, the pit dominated excavation in its region of the trench for pretty much the entire season. Though it did cut the Ubaid contexts, it was an interesting feature in its own regard, containing butchered cow bones (5085.19), the horns of a figurine (5085.31) and a complete vessel (5085.40). It appears from early analysis that the pit dates to the 2nd or 3rd millennium.   Another, much smaller but similar in construction pit, L5122, was found to the east of L5085. What_Ñés its whole original extent was will likely remain unclear, though, due to its being cut on the north, east, and presumably top by ash pit L5116.      Surface Tumble and Pit L5116      At only about a meter and a half below modern-day surface levels, the NE corner of the trench remains the most enigmatic. For most of the season we couldn_Ñét make heads or tails of the region. Especially perplexing was a series of 3rd millennium pedestal bases found at the same horizontal level as Ubaid sherds to their west. A sounding (L5093) was dug to try and determine the relationship between Ubaid context L5079 and the more easterly L5084 but unfortunately nothing concrete came of it. In the end I was forced to conclude that either we are dealing with a some poorly differentiated pits or we simply are still dealing with surface tumble in the NE and (until we reached oven L5138) and central-E of the trench. To be fair, this is really not at all unlikely given we plowed through over a meter of topsoil and tumble in others areas of the trench before we encountered good contexts and with the slope of the tepe in area D one can reasonably expect a thick layer of tumble.   Apparently below the thick tumble layers, however, was a very large ash pit (L5116), occupying roughly the majority of the NE corner of the trench and, notably, cutting both plaster-lined pit L5122 and oven L5138. However, other than its size and what it cuts it was relatively uninteresting.      Human Remains      Towards the end of the middle of the season while digging a small sounding, L5125, in the NW corner to try and determine if we were below the level of pit L5085 (we were, as we had found the plaster bottom of the pit) we uncovered a human elbow and subsequently ball of the femur stick out of the western baulk. After some time debating over how to deal with the skeleton, it was decided that because it potentially could be from a very important context we would take down the baulk to its level, back approximately 70 centimeters to see if we could make it excavatable. All went well in the baulk reduction and the bone specialists commenced excavating the remains as L5135. We had originally hoped we might be able to trace the remains, which were in a very odd position, flexed and face down with tucked legs, to the Ubaid contexts below the pits but were unable to do so. We did, however, find a distinctive Late Chalcolithic sherd literally wedged between the hip and femur of the skeleton, pretty definitively dating the skeleton to that period. The context, however, remained more unclear. There was no clear burial trench so we were left to ponder if perhaps this person was thrown in a pit or got caught in some sort of structure collapse. My guess is the latter as, when coming close to the remains there are a number of mudbricks in the section where there hadn_Ñét been at higher, pit-penerated levels, however, definitive answers, if they_Ñére to be found, will have to wait until next season.     ,~dc-terms:title: D-5-2002 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"974,2002-08-24," D-6-2002-08-024-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6,","D-6-2002         Trench D6 Final SummaryAugust 24, 2002   Baris Uzel, Drew McGaraghan      Introduction:      Trench D6 was started on July 3, 2002 directly South of Trench D4. This is on the Southern slope of the main mound of Kenan Tepe. The reasoning behind this placement was to capture views of the continuations of surface and architecture found in D4 during the 2001 season.       As expected, we found many surfaces with architecture that we could directly link to D4. Unexpectedly, however, we immediately found a large 7 chambered (5 main chambers, 2 \auxiliary\) furnace just under the topsoil in the NW quarter of the trench. As work continued, the furnace grew in proportion and complexity, with many associated features and surfaces, and although it was found in excellent condition, it did not provide many easy answers. It also proved to be extremely slow to excavate, because of the care required for a find of it_Ñés importance, and also because of the nature of the beast itself. When fully exposed, it stood over a meter and a half tall, and made for extremely cramped and precarious working positions. We spent the entire season exposing this feature and its associates, and the other work we did in our trench (the Southern _) was mainly for relief and to learn about the upcoming features in section. The western baulk was drawn at the end of the season, and we followed the standard closing procedures regarding the removal of features surfaces as best we could. This meant removal of the furnace and associated walls, and cleaning of the adjacent surfaces. Next years team will find a complex setup awaiting them.      Excavation Notes:      We excavated L20 and the surrounding contexts with as much care as we could with the time and resources that we had. We took several hundred photographs of this region and saved about _ of the material as samples for microanalysis and other research. We did not sift any material at all as the material we were looking for would easily be missed by such field techniques (small metal flakes), instead relying on the volume of the samples collected. We worked with two dayplans, one for the overall trench, and the other focusing on the North West corner. We documented the location of at least 90% of the slag we found with elevations and on the dayplans. Upon final removal of the furnace structure, we brought photographs to the field, and marked on the photographs the location of each KT. These photographs can be found as dayplans on the dates of August 17, 18, and 19. Also note that all elevations were taken off the datum ~8m South and a little west of the SW corner of D6      Our strategy focused on revealing as much of L20 and its related features at once so we could better understand the context as a whole (this context was frequently referred to as the L20 complex, and included the loci 20, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 6, 5, 14, 47, 48). After we had accomplished this we began by removing the unorganized structural debri. As we were working we cut many sounding/section loci to preview the upcoming contexts.       The Furnace (L20 complex):      L20 (started as L2) is the structure (walls and later \pillars\) of the large 1.3 by 1 x 1 meter tall 5 chambered furnace that is pottery dated to ~1800 BCE. The eastern walls of this structure continue down into a large pit just to its East. We realized late the nature of this pit and included these lower portions of L20 as the Western walls of the pit itself. Similar progression happened elsewhere and so the large pit is defined by L20 (mixed), L6 (mixed) and L5, which consists of the Eastern wall of this pit. This pit will be described as \pit 20/6/5\. Also note that the Loci 24, 25, 26, 27, and 28 refer to the contents (fill) inside the individual chambers, and that 21, 22, and 23 are buffer/buttress loci designated for excavation purposes rather than material differentiation.      The structure of L20 itself consisted of a heavy earth and stone wall forming a gentle curve in the west. From this jumbled wall extended 6 brick lined walls, the interior 4 extending directly east (more or less) and the outer 2 following the curve of the back wall before running parallel with the others. The two larger interior chambers consisted of large pillars built of mudbrick walls with very hard packed interior fill. Large pieces of pottery were set into this fill at a moderate eastward angle. These areas did not show any exposure to heat, and their purpose is still a good mystery. Throughout this construction, a general pattern revealed itself. It appears some areas of the furnace were considered more critical than others, and that they were carefully constructed of shaped bricks. Others areas were built of jumbles of rock and earth. In many cases large rocks float in a matrix of soil rather than set on other rocks.      L6 was first noted as debri to the North of L20. As we excavated this debri we noted strange orange yellow debris which gradually became clear to be a wall made of very hard friable earth which appeared to have been cooked at high temperature. We excavated the debri from L6, and eventually followed it into the pit 20/6/5. We did not notice any distinct breaks in this debri, but rather a continuous jumble of varying qualities. This leaves L6 as define as 3 entities, which will be separated by description. \L6 wall\ is the Northwestern wall to the pit L20/6/5. \L6 debri\ is the unconsolidated debri starting near the top of L6 and continuing and filling the Northern arm of the pit L20/6/5. Finally, as we were excavating, the debris resolved into a small single chamber furnace with slag coated walls, which will be referred to as \L6 chamber\. The foundation line (and some mudbricks) provided a direct link between L6 and L20, showing them to be the same structure. Much of the material making up the varied parts of L20 was very subtly differentiated, and the timeline in which we excavated it led in part to the confusion.      L5 was first noted as a hard line across the surface of L30. Excavation revealed it to be a very hard friable wall partially covered in slag, very similar to wall L6. We later realized it was in fact the edge of a large pit that had been hardened by heat and material. At this point the nature of L6 and L20 also became clear. It is interesting to note that despite the direct connection between L6, L5, and L20, there is no direct join. Instead the walls are offset to overshoot each other slightly. This may possibly be an air intake, as the gap is only about 10 cm wide.      L14 is a small single chamber furnace to the South (with slag coated interior). It later became clear that in at least one rebuilding this was open (ie, only it_Ñés Southern wall existed). This wall joins cleanly with L20, and the foundation line clearly showed these to once have been parts of the same structure. L14 also contains the South western part of the walls of the pit L20/6/5.      L29, L44 and L50 comprise the contents of pit L20/6/5. We excavated L29 about 4cm at a time continuing down almost 1.20 m before determining that we were below the bottom of the furnace L20. Near this elevation to the North we found a new surface (L54) under the debri in L6 and a mudbrick divider/wall (L55). Note that the slag stopped on the West walls of the pit L20/6/5 at about 1 meter below surface 17.       We designated L44 after noticing a color shift in the pit baulk below L14. It appeared that the North wall of L14 might continue downward. Upon excavation, however, we discovered the material in L44 was the same jumble as we found in L29.       L50 is another locus that consists of the jumbled mudbrick fill first found in L29. It was originally underneath the eastmost walls of L26, 27, and 28. The part directly under L27 and 28 was excavated and the more northerly portion was left for next year.      L10 was first found as a 2 course 1 row wall just to the south of the back (west) wall of L20. It continues in a southwest arc into the west baulk. As we removed the back wall of L20 we noted that it continues through about half of the back wall of L20, although a very large (40 cm) flagstone was found abutting the actual join with the furnace.      L16 is a wall that appears to align with L10 about half a meter North of the back wall of L20. It continues the same general arc as L10, and is composed of about the same materials. It is good to note that the upper courses of each of these walls consists of large stones set on (in some areas) smaller stones and then hard mudbrick like material, After a few cm of this material both walls set on the surfaces L17 and L30.       L17 and L30 are two sections of the same surface. This surface has a general tendency to slope downward to the South and East (as do other surfaces in D6) these surfaces make up the foundation for L20, 14, 6, 16, 10.      L47 is a small curving wall extending from the NW corner of L20. It_Ñés purpose has not been fully explored yet.      L48 is a large pile of rocks under L47. Although we can only see about half a square meter of it, it appears to be the terminus of a large row heading off to the west. Again, we do not have much to work with.      Other associations:      The surface L17 continues all the way across D6, and towards the South we found a pile/surface of large (~20cm) stones focused around a large conglomerate. This feature consisted of basalts, sandstones, and other large rocks (~20cm) in a very similar manner to what has been referred to as the Kenan Tepe rock garden, previously found in area C.      L35 consists of a large conglomerate piece that abuts the wall of L5. I do not include it as one of the principle characters as it is ~20 cm below the main action (based on surfaceL17) and because we did not excavate down to its related surface.      The Theories:      The L20 complex is currently believed to be a bronze/copper/tin smelting furnace. The sheer amount (maybe 20 kilos) of slag found supports this. It may also have been a pottery kiln or was built for some other furnace, as its possible the slag simply leeched from the building materials used. The varieties of slag found combined with the type of material it was found on (mudbricks of many colors, pottery, earthen walls, stone) seem to refute this. It seems unlikely that such a variety of materials could produce such a consistent volume of like material (slag). That being said, we did find at least four main varieties of slag. 1. Bright green and drippy 2. Dull green and crackled 3. Black with big drips. 4. Grey green with small eddies and drips. We did not have much time to thoroughly examine all the slag however, forgive the rough description.      At the time of writing it is currently believed that the L20 complex actually represents at least two phases of construction/reconstruction. The debri in the pit L20/6/5 contained many layers of slag and mudbricks of varying size and composition. This seems to indicate multiple structures are represented in this collapse. Also, the side chambers L6 and L14 both consisted of a small chamber contained within a U shaped wall. These chambers were then sitting on debri inside L20/6/5. When we finally removed all structures the foundation line showed a shallow arc that did not include the south wall of chamber L6 or the north wall of L14 (the \interior walls\). The current theory is that there were two building phases, the first more open and utilizing the entire large pit, and the second more compartmentalized and less deep. This is supported by the slag, which from continuous drips in areas that would have been filled if the interior walls existed. The other option would be that these interior walls are false, and composed of tumble and debri. The slag on these walls was correctly oriented, however, and does not support this. This general theory might be applied to the main furnace itself, as the extensions to chambers 25, 26 and 27 also continued out onto areas of debri.       The pit L20/6/5 was bordered by a broken wall to the east (L5). It is possible that the northern, more narrow end might have been used as the fuel (wood, for this time period) input for the earlier phase of the furnace. I_Ñém not sure how the spacing would have worked on the later, more divided variant. The east wall L5 does not quite join with L6, and these gaps may have been air intakes. Also found during excavation was a soft spot in the hard baked coating of L5 that was being used by a mouse as a passage. This hole only measures about 8 cm in diameter, so perhaps may have been used as a bellows hole or to add small amount of catalysts/ingredients.      The whole of this area is divided by the walls L10 and L16. Neither surface 30 or 17 crosses the boundary of these walls, and the material inside is made up of hard mudbricks, which we missed while excavating but show up in the section. We believe that the furnace possibly set against the outer wall of some building or maybe terrace.       The Others:      The southern half of D6 revealed many surfaces and jumbled features. It is interesting to note that the lower surface L37 followed the same boundary (set by wall L10) as the upper surface L17. One theory set out was that the use period for the L20 complex was not very long, and that perhaps the 10cm difference between L17 and L30 could have occurred within the space of a few years, or even a season. We found slag and a metal piece about halfway across floor 37.      We cut several sections down in the southeast corner finding many stone groupings and evidence of many new surfaces. We found many artifacts in this area, including a large stone \bowl\, an animal figurine, and a nice grindstone (almost worn out).      We did not have a lot of time to thoroughly explore this area however, and most of the architecture we found was very jumbled and confusing.              ,~dc-terms:title: D-6-2002-08-024-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6,"975,2002-08-24," A-9-2002-08-024-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area A/Trench 9,","A-9-2002   Final Trench Summary, Year 2002 Season   Area A   Trench 9   August 24, 2002         A9 is a partition of the original step trench A2. The trench begins at 25m down the tepe and ends at 41m, which is the bottom of the tepe. The trench is 2m wide by 12m and is located directly below A8 and we share one baulk between us. Hereafter I will refer to sections of this trench as 1-12m not 25-41m. We started in top soil at the beginning of the season at the elevation of 589.52 at the south baulk, our final elevation for the south baulk is 585.26 for a total of 4.29m dug at the south baulk. We moved all of the top soil from the 1-12 meter mark but did not get past subtopsoil in the north 3.75 meters of the trench. We had originally pegged the trench as a 2m x 16m trench but decided to open A10 sounding below the 12m peg in order to reach virgin soil. The goal of the season for the step trench was to reveal the stratigraphy from the top of the mound to the bottom and hit virgin soil at the end. We did achieve our goal in trench A9 when we reached the late Chalcolitic layers because most of the previous steps in A2 had been Early Bronze Age, according to the pottery reading.      This part of the step trench had never been dug before so we broke new ground directly below trench A8 which was the end of where Ellie dug in the 2001 season. The top soil, L1, continued for about a meter before we hit a change in fill color which appeared to be subtopsoil in L2. We kept L1 and L2 open all the way down the trench to the 12 meter peg. We only reached subtopsoil, L2 at the middle step about half way down the trench, the north 3.75m of the trench is still in L1. We reached a layer of very hard red fill at the south baulk which became L3. Later we saw that we had cut through a 1 course 1 row mud brick wall in L3, we could not see an associated features in section.       The large mud brick wall, L7      After this wall in L3 we began hitting large layers of mixed fill with dark and light ash mixed with mud brick debris. It was hard to delineate changes in the composition of the fill since everything was so mixed. We opened L5 as the top of these mixed ashy fill layers, L5 later became the top of a tall mud brick wall which was L7. Two cylinder seal impressions were found in a pottery bag during pottery reading, KT 21 and 22. I am not sure if they were found in the same bag, they were given to me after they were discovered.       The fill south of L7 mud brick wall was L6. We screened L6 at a 1:3 ratio and found a small find bone bead, KT 18 during screening. We also found a nice bull head figurine, KT 23, a small ceramic chalice KT12 and a clay disk shaped bead KT 25. We changed to L8 when the mixed had a higher concentration of mud brick debris than ash. We opened L9 at the SW corner of L8 in an area of especially large animal burrows. We later split L8 into L13 and L14. L13 is soft ashy fill with a smaller concentration of mud brick debris and L14 is a very compacted area of mud brick debris. L6, L8, L13 and L14 all abut the wall in L7. We spent a week or so slowly sectioning off each fill locus trying to find some sort surface or foundation to the wall. We finally did find the bottom of the wall after we cut to a layer of ash that began at the south side of the wall at the south baulk beneath the wall to the north another .5m. The continuous ash layer was split into three loci. L13 which had been opened under L14 at the west baulk south of the wall, L18 directly beneath the wall foundation and L15 ash north of the wall. We decided to merge all of these loci into L18 after we finished excavating the wall system.       After we found the continuous ash layer we had to reevaluate what the fill below the colored bricks of the wall was. It was later decided that the wall was built upon a thick and compacted clay foundation, L17, which was a grey color and had no bricks or lines in it. We can see in the west baulk that this foundation layer continues south of the wall and is equal to the hard packed clay in L14. We excavated the wall in three parts, L7 is the bricks, L17 is the compacted clay foundation, and L18 is the ash layer beneath.       Also in the SW corner of the trench we found a small area of very compacted clay with lots of river pebbles that was extremely difficult to chop through with a hand pick and impossible to trowel. We later saw in the south baulk section that this may have been the top of a very thin and almost undetectable surface leading directly to the wall. Beneath layers of seasonal deposits of ash and mud brick slump.      North of the wall in L7 we opened L12 as slope was which we continued to the edge of the top step.       L7 was poorly preserved but it appears that there were at least 2 rows and 5 courses. The wall did not reach the east baulk but there was a layer of fill which we called L17 as well that continued to the east baulk. On the day of excavation I made a top plan of what I think the wall looked like.       After clearing L7 and L17 we opened the entire south 1m x 2m section of the trench to L18. In L18 we found the remains of a white reed impression, L19 which was very similar to the earlier phases of reed impression in Trench A8 and Trench A2 in the upper levels of the step trench. We can see remains of L19 in the west baulk which we drew onto the west baulk section drawing. What was unique about this impression is that it was nestled in an ashy area so we were able to take some good flotation samples. We scraped off L19 and saved a few samples for further analysis. We closed L18 and L19 and opened L20 as mixed fill and L21 as an area of mud brick debris at the SE corner of the trench. We cut a sounding in the East half of L20 and stopped at some very compacted clayey fill which became L22.       The Pit, L23      When we cleared L20 we found a huge pit below which was about 1.75m x 1.2m and about 1m deep. The pit is L23 and was mixture of loose dark ash, very loose almost powder like areas of lighter ash with shreds of white organic material, clumps of clay, mud brick debris, and charcoal. In the early layers of the pit we found a small area of tiny river pebbles, very colorful and a large concentration of clam shell also from the river. When we decided that L23 was definitely a pit we dug it as fast as possible to get rid of any mixed contexts. The fill was so soft we dug it with a shovel most of the time. We finally reached the bottom of the pit and an area of compacted clayey loam devoid of ash which we called L26 and did not get a chance to excavate by the end of the season. L26 may have a surface coming up at the SW corner of the locus because we found some flat lying sherds and a large animal jaw.       We continued digging L22 as the fill adjacent to the pit until we reached a small surface, L29 with some pottery debris, L28 laying on top. The surface in L29 was the same fill as L22 but it had a small ash area that could be a hearth in the south west section of the locus. We picked up some partial pots one fine ware, KT 2 L28 and some cooking pot pieces KT 1 L28. Also in L22 we found a series of large cobbles adjacent to the west baulk that could be a foundation for a wall but they were not very organized. There were two cobbles that were flat and thin that could have been used as a flat work surfaces. In this area we found a lot of obsidian flakes and under one of the cobbles we found our first Ubaid pot sherd. It seems that most of the Ubaid sherds are concentrate in L22 or the fill below this area and not on the north side of the step in the surfaces. It is possible that some earlier pot sherds were dug up in a later period.       We closed L22 and opened L34 as the fill below the level of the L29 surface.       Once we had cleared all of L22 adjacent to the pit we could see in the south baulk a perfect outline of the pit where it touches the walls around it in L22 . It is more narrow at the top than at the bottom and bows out at the very bottom where it touches L26. There is a very nice drawing of it in the south baulk section drawing we did later in the season.       Layered surfaces and small mud brick walls      Here is a very interesting area of the trench and series of small debris surfaces with some small poorly preserved mud brick walls. All of these contexts occur between the second and third meter peg of the trench.       We began by digging this area as part of L12, mixed slope wash. Went through mixed fill locus 24 and L27 until we reached the top of the first surface, L30. This surface was very poorly preserved and difficult to follow or articulate because it was basically debris stamped into a hard compacted clayey fill mixed with many small river pebbles. We closed L30 and opened the fill below as L31 cleared that area until we found L32 surface which was better preserved that the last one but was only 1m in length but the exact same composition. We picked up L32 surface but did not screen because we thought the fill was too compacted to screen. We did not find any small finds in this surface. We closed L32 and opened L33 as fill below. Excavated to the next surface in L37 which continued all the way to the west baulk but was cut by a pit L36 at the east baulk. It was at this point that this area became complicated.       Before finding the surface in L37 we had seen a small mud brick wall with a cobble foundation, L39 coming up at the SW corner of L33 by the time we had articulated L37 we found another smaller mud brick wall with 2 cobbles associated with it, L38. These two walls are a similar color and composition and they abut each other but L39 is substantially higher in elevation than L38. I believe that these two walls are related as either earlier and later levels of the same wall or a terraced wall. We can see in the west baulk that there was a mud brick wall which has eroded down a slope and ended on top of the current series of surfaces. We have drawn this in our section drawing of the west baulk. The red bricks of these walls are not directly associated with the surfaces but may have been built at alternating levels with the surfaces and the compacted fill above these surfaces may be debris from a previous mud brick wall construction. This is possible because each new surface continues under the level of the previous mud brick debris layer and does not stop abruptly at it, as it would if the surface and the wall were built contemporary to each other. We took down the walls in L39 and L38 and cleared the mud brick like grey fill below them as one entity L41. Then we extended L34 as all of the fill south of L37. We now had a clear view of L37 which had extended further south below the level of L38 and L41. We cleared the surface in three parts, two sections for micro analysis samples to go to Andy and the rest was screened and separated in the correct artifact screening bags. We changed to fill below L37 to L40 and cleared it to the new surface L42. L36 continued as a pit which cuts L40 and 42 at the east baulk. I believe that this pit may extend into the adjacent locus L35 but I wanted to dig down the the level of L35 to see if it was true. L42 is a very well preserved version of the same surface in L37 and the previous surfaces. We did not have time to excavate this surface before the end of the season. The fill abutting this surface looked very much like mud brick. I cut it down slowly and sprayed and scraped around a lot looking for mud brick. I sectioned off an area what I thought was mud brick as L43 and cut it down in sections looking for brick lines. We cleared L43 and opened L44 as fill abutting the surface. This is how we left it at the end of the excavation season.      Slope wash and the edge of the first two steps      Because of the nature of the step trench invariably the best contexts are to be found very deep and far from the slope edge. We had many erosion layers starting with the topsoil loci L1 and L2. Continuing to L12 as the fill adjacent to the top step, then L16 and L25 as more slope wash continuing further south in the trench. Our goal was to have the entire 1-8m leveled as one step, which we very nearly accomplished. The way I did this quickly was by changing to a mixed locus like L12 and cutting back the edge of the step until I found a change in fill. That way we could get a section on what contexts or fill layers we would be excavating. This is how we found the wall in L7, and the we were able to know exactly when the surfaces would come up in L32, L37 and L42. As we were cutting back more of the slope was in L25 we found an area of loose ashy fill at the south west corner of the locus that contained a small andiron KT 22. We then changed the south meter of L25 to L35 because we had cut past the eroded fill and were in mixed ashy fill layers. In L35 we cut down about 15cm to get a better section on the surfaces in the adjacent step and found that below L42 there is another surface coming up identical to the previous ones, we did not get the chance to reach that level.      Things to watch out for next season      In L26 the bottom of the pit we may have surface coming up at the SW corner. In L44 the fill south of the surface L42 there is an Ubaid sherd in situ at the SE corner. There may be some Ubaid contexts coming up. L42 surface has not yet been excavated and will probably not be preserved next year. Luckily under L42 a the level of L35 there is another identical surface coming up. L36 is still a pit cutting the surfaces and fill next to them, it probably continues to the level of L35. The rest of the trench is eroded fill, only L35 may yield some new contexts at the its southern most area.

This is an extremely interesting unit. To begin with we found no EIA or MB sherds. Unlike the sounding I.1, this does not appear to consist of slope wash or other erosion deposits. The sherds were all EB or earlier. The EB is characterized by typical diags such as the fingernail impressed decoration and the t&gt;52 goblets. Type 7 wares were also common. The transition between the EB and LC takes place somewhere between 4003 and 4007. The late chalolithic levels contain good chalcolithic types including various versions of the Hammer-head bowl and LC cups. Neither the EB levels or the LC levels contain extremely worn or extremely fragmented sherds suggesting that these remains come from occupational deposits.

Today we finished the clearing of L1, the erosional and baulk fill in both the previous E1 sounding and the westward expansion. In clearing the northern baulk we noticed definite lighter brown fill on top (7.5 YR 7/3), a thin orange strip (5 YR 6/6) most probably a surface on top of black ashy level, and the botom 40 cm composed of dark brown compacted soil (7.5 TR 4/3).

In the north baulk section of the E1 sounding, approx. 1.60 m. below L2, a small ash deposit is also discernable and Bradley hypothesized it could be an evodence for an ash pit.    In order that we may be sure we have completely removed the erosional material, we excavated 15 cm out of the E1 sounding area revealing a darker soil area eith bits of charcoal. A painted Ubaid neck fragment and obsidian flakes were also recovered from the north baulk in the sounding area leading us to believe we have reached contextual material.

Photographs were taken and labeled  orth baulk section.\   These same stratigraphic levels are also visible in the west baulk of the west expansion as well as in the east baulk section in the E1 sounding where either a pit extending down from a surface level is present. However there is also a possibility that the loose soil in the area is due to rodent burrowing or other activity. As with the north baulk section, the bottom ~40cm in the east baulk is composed of dark brown compacted soil (7.5YR 4/3).   In the north baulk section of the E1 sounding, approx. 1.60m below L2, a small ash deposit also became visible as the baulk was cut back and straightened. Bradley hypothesizes the layer could be evidence for an ash pit.   We then excavated 15cm into the E1 sounding area and 10cm into the west expansion because we wanted to be sure we have completely removed the erosion material. In the E1 sounding area a darker soil area with bits of charcoal was uncovered lead us to believe we have now reached new contextual material. A painted Ubaid neck fragment and obsidian flakes were also recovered from the north baulk in this sounding area further reinforcing this thought and providing an idea of what might be expected as we open a new locus in this area tomorrow.   In the west expansion of the trench a reddish brown compacted soil extending 30-40cm south from the north baulk indicated again to us that we had reached new contextual material in this area.

This results in a 4 x 8 m trench. We have made it this size in order to allow sufficient baulks, especially on the N edge.      Because the trench was restrung, the edges of Locus 1 were no longer square with the strings so we designated the remaining soil along the N and W strings as Locus 2. The workers are removing this soil down to the level of the bottom of Locus 1. We have designated the subsoil below L1 as Locus 3 and the section that may be a wall as Locus 4.      Locus 5 is the next area of top soil downslope. It includes both the NE and SW corners of the trench, but excludes the area in the extreme SE, which will later become a locus on its own.      The concentration of stones in Locus 1 along the W string line extends W into Locus 2. It currently appears to resemble tumble rather than a wall, but some large sherds lying flat may suggest otherwise.      Locus 4 was designated as a feature, while the men were digging Locus 5. We removed locus 4 stone by stone. The stones were large, measuring approx. 30 cm wide. Under these stones was a layer of mud brick. The bricks were not clearly defined, they existed in an area roughly 20 x 30 cm. There was also a strain of soft white unfired clay which ran back into the balk. This substance was very fine, almost silt or talc. After breakfast we got another workman. After removing Locus 4, it became clear that there was a path and across the top of Locus 3. Bradley suggested it was a pit. After Locus 5 is cleaned and we return to the highest step of the trench, we will excavate it as 3 locii. Locus 3 will be the NW corner, Locus 6 the \pit\ (continuation of cobbles from Locus 4 feature) and Locus 7 the southern part.     ,~: D-8-2004-07-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 1,"985,2004-07-04," I-2-2004-07-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area I/Trench 2/Locus 1,","   Daily Trench    Area I   Trench 2   July 4, 2004   J. Henecke      Today I opened up a new trench in area I (I2) on the southern slope. The trench is 1 x 6 m and runs up the slope. There is a line of stones, which may be a continuation of the fortification wall found on the other end of the mound, bisecting the trench and a depression at the northern end. The trench will be excavated in two steps, demarcated roughly by the line of stones. Locus 1 will encompass all of the topsoil and soil until the steps have been leveled. Only the northern step was cleared today, and there appears to be several changes in soil color. Since the material seems to be mixed fill, none of the pottery was saved, although before disposal, Bradley identified several 2nd millennium diagnostic pieces (namely applied rim storage vessels). Small stones and pebbles were included within the fill. I2 was selected in order to determine the types of materials and periods present in this area of the tepe. A sounding trench in a previous season revealed several meters of fill, predominately from later periods, but our hope is to determine the extent of the erosion and to reach earlier periods. In order to reach lower possibly undisturbed levels, we are digging the top section very quickly.

Eppihimer   July 4 to July 8, 2004      Trench 9 in Area D was opened this week as a new trench intended to expand upon the Ubaid contexts discovered in trench D5 during the 2000 season. It is located to the E of D5 and measures 6 by 4 meters. A small baulk will be left between the two, but it is hoped that significant Ubaid contexts may be reached by the end of the season.   Before excavation, there was a significant slope down to the E-NE, with a 1.5 m difference in elevation. In order to eliminate much of the topsoil and contaminated deposits that might result from this slope, about 75 centimeters of soil were removed as Locus 1, an arbitrary locus. The trench was then split into two parts to gain greater control of the material. The western portion (Locus 2) was subsoil fill and the eastern portion (Locus 3) was still mixed with topsoil. Both were 25 to 30 centimeter arbitrary levels.    After the removal of Locus 2, some features started to emerge in the western part of the trench. An oven in the extreme SW corner is the most apparent. Others include an area of mudbricks in the northern part and a hint of a pebble layer (visible in the east bulk of D5) at the center of the west stringline.

Important note: yesterday (July 4, 2004) there was a confusion with the loci and the relationship between surfaces and fills.

We also opened L&amp; , a light brown (10 YR 7/1) pebbles surface set in a medium clay matrix. It is located west of L8 and seems to be separated by a 20-30 cm dip or trough, possible an animal burrow along the edge of L8.

We decided that is was better to divide the sounding area into two separate loci: L9 and L10. Plastic foil and the water bottle label was found in L9 leading us to believe that we are sadly still in mixed fill.   L10 is another light brown (7.5 YR 4/3) compact pebble surface with small 3-5 cm rocks, crashed pottery and some larger stones 15 cm average.

Two small finds were removed; and obsidian flake and half of a weight (rounded stone with a hole in the middle) after discussion last night we realized that the trench is 9x4 instead of the 8x4 we had thought. The reason for this is that we never measured a 1m balk into the south side as we had originally planned. Since we are loosing the full meter on the north string it was decided we did not need a balk on the S side. There is a large pile of rocks in L5 running back into L7. After examination we decided that the rocks were a natural feature and removed them along with the rest of the topsoil from L5. L6, a patch of rock displayed by the removal of L4 showed up in the balk created by the removal of L5. We previously thought it only extended partway into the upper tier (L3+L7) it is now clear that it is simply not visible but does continue until it comes out into the balk, the function of this feature is still not clear. Bradley expressed that it night be a robber trench. We will excavate L3 and L7 which sandwich L6 down to the level of the bottom of L5. Hopefully this will allow us to better discern what L6 is. Thought out the Loci up to this point we have found several metal stakes. The type of stake which the UTARP team uses to hold down tents and demarcate trenches. One such stake is sticking up vertically out of the middle of L6. Another is visible coming horizontally out of L3 (though the balk created by L5,) another two were found in L1 and L5. This seems to indicate that we are still in topsoil. At the end of the day L3 was mostly removed.

Elevations and photographs were taken and L6 was removed.   We decided that it was better to divide the sounding area into two separate loci once L5 was removed based on the differentiation in soil textures and composition is two separate areas. L9 occupies the entire sounding area and is a brown (7.5YR 4/3) medium clay fill with loose clumps and small pebbles. This level was identified by the presence of old water erosion from the original E1 sounding trench and was also confirmed by the presence of plastic and other modern papers. Sadly this indicates that we are probably still in mixed erosion fill. Only 15cm were excavated in this locus this afternoon.   The other locus, L10, is located NW of the original E1 sounding and is another light brown (7.5YR 4/3) compact pebble surface with small 3-5cm rocks, crushed pottery and some larger stones 15cm average.

We leveled and straightened the northern step (L1) and began to excavate and level the southern step (L2), located south of the line of stones (L3). It is unclear whether L3 represents a wall or road, but the stones seem to extend about 50 cm. below the surface. The stone feature has flat layers of pottery (large storage jars ?), pebbles and stones without layers of fill in between. This seems to indicate that the feature was continuously used for at least a period of time without any significant breaks. No finds were kept although small pieces of bone and many pottery sherds were found. The diagnostic 2nd millennium storage jar fragments continued through all the layers. We are excavating the trench as a sounding so as to reach the hopefully undisturbed material below. Tomorrow we will begin new loci in both of the steps in addition to continuing with the stone feature (L3). Both steps show a similar stratigraphic sequence with a small layer of topsoil, a loose plow zone and a layer of occupational debris that stretches beneath the excavated area.

It was decided that those features recorded in 2002 and a 5-10cm layer contaminated by the recent work could be removed subject to a watching brief from BU and NL with the oven loci 5155, 5156 and 5157 to be excavated as soon as possible. Following the squaring of the east baulk on July 2 the step baulk abutting the oven and the east baulk had become more pronounced.

Excavation continued in L9 located in the E1 sounding. 15 cm down we are still getting mixed Ubaid and possibly EB pottery and more plastic suggesting that we are still within contaminated levels. The top of a 50 X 25 cm light tan (2.5 YR 7/2) mud brick was found in L9 extending SE east out of the west baulk. A plastic wrapper was 10 cm below the top of the brick on its S side. A smaller concentration of pottery and pebbles were along the east baulk.    After consultation with Bradley and Lynn it has been hypothesized hat a line of 3-4 stones in the southern corner of L9 are perhaps the foundation of a large wall, maybe even retaining. A high concentration of obsidian lithics and a Ubaid cooking pot in the NE corner originally led us to believe we are at fresh EB or Ubaid levels. However adjacent to the mud brick in L9 and at the level of the rock string a large amount of modern foil was found suggesting again that we remained in contaminated soil.    It has been noted that in the level L9 baulk profiles certain areas of obvious fill aligned with more compacted soil that hints at a structure. A new surface in the L9 north baulk profile below the previous charcoal level is similar to the compacted pebble/crushed pot/ sherds matrix seen in L2 and L7 though none are associated. The field identification of pottery from L2, L7 and L10 (including L9 N profile level) has provided context for second millennium for L2 and L7 but Ubaid for L10 and L9.     ,~: E-2-2004-07-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 2,"994,2004-07-06," D-8-2004-07-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 3,","   Daily    Area D   Trench 8   July 6, 2004      Today began with the clearing of L7. L3 is not yet finished, the balk needs to be cleaned and the floor leveled however we wanted to use the small pick and trowel to investigate the north side of L6. Whereas yesterday we believed L6 may be a robber trench or some other form of pit to trench further investigation suggests it may be a wash or drainage ditch. Water would have carried smaller items away but the larger items would have sunk and stayed. Most of the day was spent clearing L7 and L6. L3 was mostly removed yesterday but it had to be taken down 15-20 more centimeters to make it level, however the balk still needs to be cleaned. As the workmen were clearing L7 on the south side of 6 we attempted to define the north side of L6. We then did the same for the south side. On the south side close to the west balk we were able to very clearly see the layers of rock and pottery lying horizontally. Though we had pedestaled it like a wall it was clear that it was not. We took a photo of the south side of L6 were it was most defined. The most interesting part of L6 and the thing which best confirms its classification as its own locus is the plethora of items which were stuffed in the small area. Pottery, rocks, large head crusher rocks to pebbles, and bone were the most prominent components. However all together there were pottery sherds, stones, soil, bone, shells, mud brick and slag. At the end of the day L6 was mostly gone however the entire west balk needs to be straightened then everything needs to be cleaned up.

It would be very useful to create a section drawing by the end of the season once the section is cleaned back again. In the meantime BU completed a rough sketch with some measurements scanned in a s a B day plan.      Once the trench had been levelled in most areas we defined a number of new loci and took levels, munsells, compositions and pictures.      However, in the south west corner we conducted a surface scrape on the existing level that revealed a clear mud brick structure in both section and plan. The section showed that we had come down approximately 5cm already into the structure that was also cut by a possible mudbrick basin that had been excavated in 2002. Therefore we had a fireplace/pit marked by the ashy layer defined on July 5 separated from the mudbrick structure by a layer of fill.

Only L3, the s tone feature, continues from the previous days work. We noticed a black ash layer in the northern profile of L4, which has several large potsherds above it and was dug out by an animal hole. After breakfast I terminated L4 and 5 and decided to dig the remainder of the trench in 25 cm increments. Fewer potsherds appeared in the lower levels, and they included red wash ware, a carinated bowl fragment and more applied rim jars. A ceramic spindle whorl, stone cylinder and other occupational debris were also uncovered. The layers of topsoil and plowed soil in the southern step are thinner than to the north, and it is possible that L3 acted as a natural retaining wall. Also, it appears that the stones and soil slump in the eastern profile, possibly due to erosion. It seems likely that the fill beneath the stone layers is undisturbed, and its scattered assortment of contents supports this idea. During the excavation of L4 and 6, several large stones and a mortar, similar to those in L3, emerged along the western baulk, and it is possible that L3 extends in this direction. We are in the process of articulating the stones in L3 to determine its vertical and horizontal dimensions.

However when Bradley came over after we had cleaned he pointed out that the eastern edge, in an approximately 1.5m swath following the curve of the hill was still sub topsoil. There was also still evidence of L6 showing in both the newly cleaned balk and on the flat surface in the form of large rocks, potsherds and grouped pebbles. Because of this we are simply continuing the same loci. L5 is the sub topsoil on the west stretch, L6 is the pit/wash/ditch, L3 is the north of L6 and L7 is South of L6. Because it became clear yesterday the L6 is not a wall this time we are removing it as a pit, that is, we are removing it before removing L3 or L7. L5 we are removing at the same time but that is just to get ride of it because it is still sub topsoil. Ahmet who is digging L6 noted a change in the soil of L6. One meter east out of the west balk the soil changed from the fine loose texture in L5 to harder clumped soil. This soil is a pinkish grey ( 7.5YR 6/2.) We also found a few bits or charcoal, to at least some carbon-ish burned matter. As we continued to take L6 down a thick layer of pebbles appeared. The pebble layer is not perfectly flat, however that may be because we already hacked through it. The pebbles range in size from 1cm-7cm. The most interesting feature is the variety of colors the pebbles are in. I pulled out several to munsell. The colors were 5R 6/4 pale red, 5R 7/6 light red, 5R 2.5 very dusky red, 5/5GY greenish grey, 5Yr 6/6 reddish yellow. As we continued to clear this area it became apparent that this was a floor. Looking at the balk it is now clear that the original L6 pit is different from the floor. There is a bare space in the balk of about 10 cm which is the divider. It appears that there are actually several floors layered one right on top of another; at least two more are visible in the balk which we cut trough.

Henecke      Today we continued to dig in arbitrary 25 cm intervals, beginning L8 and 9. L8 seems to have a soil change from the previous layer, although Bradley continues to identify pottery from the 2nd millennium. There is the possibility that one fragment is an EB pedestal. An incised sherd was removed from the eastern profile, but it also indicates a later date for this level. After 25 cm, we began L10 and 11, although the actual excavation of L10 will not begin until tomorrow. In the upper centimeters of L11 an obsidian tool was uncovered but the entire locus lacked distinguishing pottery fragments. Little work has been done on L3, which has defiantly extended north into L8 and 10. A 2nd millennium applied rim jar fragment is visible below the line of stones in this outcrop, but no other remains have been uncovered. We removed all loose soil from the top of L3, in order to articulate the stones, and by doing so it no longer appears to be a road. Rather it seems more likely to be a retaining wall. The area is scattered with stones, pebbles and large ceramic sherds laid flat, but besides the outcrop it does not extend beyond a 1 m north south direction. Tomorrow it may be necessary to remove this locus. Examination of the profile of the northern step revealed an reddish stain in the NE corner, which may be mudbrick debris. It is still unclear whether further excavation will reveal any evidence for the Ubaid in this area, and as the digging becomes more difficult in the narrow trench, it is more likely that we will soon close the sounding.      ,~: I-2-2004-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area I/Trench 2/Locus 8,"999,2004-07-07," E-2-2004-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench     Area E   Trench 2   July 7, 2004         Workmen: Meki, Taner Backus D.

As there are varying elevations that were left, for example L1103 is deeper than L1102, initial efforts in F1 will be to level the area as much as possible while also following the associated features (compact cobble/pebble surfaces L1101 and L1104 and mud brick wall L1069) to elaborate more on their relationship to other features or loci that may be below the current surface.   The top most elevation was opened as a new locus, L1106, a coarse white (7.5YR 8/1) compacted clay surface containing scattered small rocks. Carbon samples (KT4) were taken from the NW corner of the locus as well as pottery (KT1) and lithic material (KT2). As we even out the elevations this locus may expand in size depending upon the nature of the soil around it.   Carbon samples were also taken from the south baulk in the SW corner of the trench from the massive burnt layer (L1037) on top of which a mud brick collapse was excavated in 2001. This sample was requested by Bradley.      ,~: F-1-2004-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1106,"1001,2004-07-07," D-5-2004-07-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5152,","   July 7 2004      The fill (5164) associated with the pit (5162) and the mud brick feature (5163) was lowered by 7-8cm.

On removal of 5162 the area was thus recategorised as 5164.      5167, classed as fill, was lowered by 8cm across its area and a number of Ubaid sherds were recorded. A group of rocks with large (undated) body sherds was also recorded in the NW area of this locus as shown on the day plan.

We began by looking at the section created by L3 to see if the floor continued into that Locus. It was there but did not seem to be very well preserved. We changed L3 to L10 to preserve any context for the floor and then went down by 5 cm increments. When we did not find the other floor there we decided to simply _ÑÉwack it_Ñé down to the level of floor L9. L7 was changed to L11 to preserve context for the floor in the south part of the trench. We are not finding much pottery in either L10 of L11. We also took L5 down 10 more cm. We dug around a large rock that was there and are waiting to see if it is sitting on something. We also found some teeth, possibly sheep (they are too small to be donkey) in L5. L10 and L11 were both taken down to the level of L9 so they will be closed, L9 and the bottom of L10 and L11 form a platform which is 20 cm above the bottom of L5. The floor is still not completely uncovered so we are not sure exactly where it goes. This means that the men cannot continue to dig that area until we know exactly where the floor is. An important point to the dating of L9 is that L10 and L11 are the context loci. L6, which is how we found L9, is useless as a context because it is so totally mixed with the things that were in the pit or wash which was the main L6 elements. The problem with L10 and L11 is that the floor (the part which is currently uncovered) is only in a 1m area disappearing into the West balk. Loci 10 and 11 covered considerably larger areas extending out further towards the slope of the hill. For example L10 extends 2.75m from the W balk and abuts L5 which is a topsoil Locus. Therefore the pottery from L10 is not a perfect context and could be mixed with things that were right above the floor to things that had fallen down from other areas and were in the topsoil.      ,~: D-8-2004-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 3,"1005,2004-07-08," F-1-2004-07-08-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 1 (July 2-8)   Area F   Trench 1   C. Painter, D. Backus      This first week of excavation we focused mainly on clearing of the trench from erosion debris accumulated since the 2002 season including cutting back of the baulks, relocating and reassigning new locus numbers, and shooting new elevations. Diana was in charge of overseeing the clearing of the trench and Catherine took over responsibility in the trench on July 7.    Many loci were remaining from last season including a small ash pit which is the remains of an oven (L1090), a sausage-shaped cobbled surface in the northeast corner (L1104), a mud brick wall that we expect has eroded greatly (L1069) and a dense rectangular pebbled surface along the east baulk (L1101).    As varying elevations were left from the 2002 season, initial efforts this week were to level the trench as much as possible to be sure we are beginning with fresh contextual soil. L1106 was opened as the topmost opening locus located in the northwest corner of the trench as was expanded south. L1107, old L1090 ash/oven pit, was excavated and found to be very shallow and mostly excavated in the previous season. West of L1107 in the northwest corner of the trench, an ash inclusion L1109 was also removed.   Cobbled/pebbled surface L1109 (old L1101) was removed along the south baulk and was found to contain activity area remains such as a grinder (KT4) and loom weight (KT5). Either a second surface or subsurface fill appear to be below this locus and will be excavated next week.   Lastly the mud brick wall emerging from the east baulk, old L1069, was reassigned as L1110 and appears to continue below our current elevation on its north side making future exploration of this feature next week mandatory.     ,~: F-1-2004-07-08-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,"1006,2004-07-08," E-2-2004-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench    Area: E    Trench: 2   July 8, 2004         Workmen: Meki, Taner.

After lifting from the edge of the pit the top soil, Bradley assumed that uncovered gray colored tin layer maybe a floor. Later on I couldn_Ñét see it , so seceded to work on L18 next working day, which is 7/10.      In the left section of the trench we opened three new loci: L 15, L 16, L 17. Bradley assumed that L 17 is a wall. We removed about 0.1 m layer from the top of L15. At the end came out some sherds.

Henecke      Today was our final attempt to reach beyond the 2nd millennium. I began L10 in the northern step, and there was a clear distinction between this fill and the previous layer. Most obviously, the tiny white roots that had been a distinctive presence before disappeared and the soil became noticeably more soft packed. In the profile, several larger stones lie along the soil change. There were few remains in this soil. Near the bottom of the locus, I thought we had encountered mudbrick because the surface was a slightly different color and of a harder composition. It turned out to only be compressed fill surrounded by animal burrows. Several large stones (possibly a wall) emerged at the base of the northern profile, but it is in a clear 2nd millenium context. After closing L11 in the southern step, we quickly dug 50 cm through L12, in the hope to penetrate into earlier periods. The few remains discovered were very similar to all previous finds. I intended to remove the layer of stones from L3 to find out what rested beneath, but there was no time. Tomorrow we will prepare the trench for stratigraphic profile drawings and close down.

L1107, a pit containing yellowish red (5YR 4/6) poorly-sorted sub-rounded clay was excavated in the northwest corner and based on its shallowness and baulk profile, the pit seems to be the continuation of L1090, a semi-circular oven installation sealed by an ash layer excavated in 2002. A slight ash deposit, L1108, west of L1107 was also removed and was found to contain greenish black (Gley 2.5/10Y) coarse sub-angular clay and ash.   L1109, a white (2.5YR 8/1) poorly-sorted medium clay surface composed of cobbles 10-20cm, pebbles 3-5cm and crushed/trampled pottery, was opened and cleared in the south end of the trench. Below 1109 what appears to either be a second, separate surface or the continuation of L1109. Bradley and I began to articulate the \surface\ but did not finish. Work will continue here next time.   A new locus number (1110) was also given to the mud brick wall emerging from the east baulk and also a remnant from the 2002 season. Currently the feature is a 1.05 x 0.30cm one course wall, light brown (7.5YR 6/4) in color and composed of coarse clay and &lt;5mm rock inclusions.

The first was the centre of the oven (5156). A cursory clean of the top surface revealed two sherds of pottery in situ and although the oven had been considered an Ubaid context the pottery suggested a reevaluation. It was therefore decided to cut a section of the NW area of the oven to use as a control in distinguishing the various layers of material prior to excavation and each layer was given a ew locus number _ÑÐ 5171, 5173, 5177, 5178 and 5179. 5177 represented a thick layer of burnt material and a carbon sample was taken from this.      Secondly we began to clean back 5151, 5152 and 5160 under a new general cleaning locus of 5174. The northern area of this locus revealed a dark and light colour differentiation across the width of the trench possibly due to the natural depositional history of the area _ÑÐ perhaps a wash?      Lastly we approached the SW corner of D5 excavating the pit (5168) and uncovering a floor surface (5169) with a possible wall feature (5172) that separates 5169 from the white material of 5176.     ,~: D-5-2004-07-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5152,"1010,2004-07-08," D-5-2004-07-08-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,","   Weekly Summary   Area D, Trench 5   B Uzel, N Luby   July 2 to July 8, 2004      During the 2002 season trench D5 revealed contexts at its southern end _ÑÐ an oven in the east section and domestic architecture in the south, except for a human burial in the NW corner. The domestic architecture and the oven were dated to the Ubaid period and from July 2 _ÑÐ July 4 material was shifted to reach the plastic sheeting that covered these contexts. On removal of the plastic the trench was divided into arbitrary cleaning loci reflecting the north-south split in context versus fill. The recorded features from 2002, L5140 and L5139 (mud brick walls) were removed, and the oven was separated into three new loci _ÑÐ a central core (5156), fill (5155) and the \walls\ (5157). Three pits were excavated _ÑÐ 5162, 5168 and 5180 and the oven was first cleaned and then sectioned to provide information on the layers in the central core. The \walls\ were considered to be arbitrary and the pottery recovered from the excavation of 5156 suggested the oven was not Ubaid but later.      The aim for week two is to concentrate on the southern portion of the trench and assess whether an older phase of Ubaid domestic context underlies that from the 2002 season. A secondary goal is to understand why the northern portion of the trench has been so poor in revealing contexts and to create a srategy to overcome this.        ,~: D-5-2004-07-08-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"1011,2004-07-08," D-9-2004-07-08-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,","   Weekly Summary   Area D, Trench 9   M. Eppihimer   July 4 to July 8, 2004      Trench 9 in Area D was opened this week as a new trench intended to expand upon the Ubaid contexts discovered in trench D5 during the 2000 season. It is located to the E of D5 and measures 6 by 4 meters. A small baulk will be left between the two, but it is hoped that significant Ubaid contexts may be reached by the end of the season.   Before excavation, there was a significant slope down to the E-NE, with a 1.5 m difference in elevation. In order to eliminate much of the topsoil and contaminated deposits that might result from this slope, about 75 centimeters of soil were removed as Locus 1, an arbitrary locus. The trench was then split into two parts to gain greater control of the material. The western portion (Locus 2) was subsoil fill and the eastern portion (Locus 3) was still mixed with topsoil. Both were 25 to 30 centimeter arbitrary levels.    After the removal of Locus 2, some features started to emerge in the western part of the trench. An oven in the extreme SW corner is the most apparent. Others include an area of mudbricks in the northern part and a hint of a pebble layer (visible in the east bulk of D5) at the center of the west stringline.

Painter      Today I decided it would be best to begin by articulating the cobbled surfaces in the northeast corner of the trench that were initially excavated at the end of the 2002 season. First a locus (1111) was opened between the two surfaces which was composed of a light gray (5YR 7/1) fine poorly-sorted silt/clay fill. Next the suprasurface fill (1112) on top of the elliptical-shaped cobble surface (1115) was removed and contained 2-3 large 50cm stones in a coarse sub-angular clay matrix. Notable find here was a grinder or pestle (KT3) resting on the cobble surface.   The northeast baulk was cut further back and cleaned (1114) as to better articulate the cobble surface below. This surface, L1113, is a white (10YR 8/1) highly coarse compacted clay matrix composed of 5-10cm cobbles and &lt;5cm rounded pebbles. Based on the elevation data as well as composition, it seems that surface 1115 and 1113 are the same entity some how cut by the L1111 fill layer.   L1115, the white (10YR 8/1) elliptical cobble surface composed of 10-15cm cobbles and 25-50cm large stones in a coarse sub-angular matrix was partially removed in order to follow a soil change occurring 50cm to the west of L1115 within L1106 and continuing east below the cobble surface. Notable finds from with the cobble surface of L1115 are a stone grinder fragment (KT4) and a shell bead (KT3).   Articulation of L1117, a cobbled and crushed pottery surface set in a coarse compacted clay matrix, continued with objects on top of the surface composing L1116, the suprasurface fill. At this time it is very difficult to surmise exactly how extensive this surface is as the tight pebble and pottery composition seems to taper off at both the east and west ends.

During the day have been discussed possibility of existence of about 1.00 wide mud wall crossing over L11 and L14 towards West-South balk.

Neither showed clearly any evidence of mudbrick and the material of the wall was very similar to the fill of 5167. The wall was therefore removed to the level of 5167.

Locus 7 is being dug from the inside out in order to determine the extent of the ash pit. The pit seems to spread outwards the deeper we dig, suggesting perhaps a domed oven. While digging the pit, the soil changed from a solid gray ash to a mottled ash, charcoal, and orange brick. At this point, I closed Locus 7 and started Locus 8 in the pit.

Eppihimer      Four new loci were defined to start the day.   Locus 4 is an area in the NW of the trench. Its N and W borders are the baulks, its S border is where an erosion layer of pebbles from the D5 baulk reaces the surface, its E border is an arbitrary line dividing subsoil from context soil. It contains mudbrick debris.    Locus 5 is an area in the SW. Its E border is also set to separate it from the mixed subsoil to the E.    Locus 6 is a swath of mixed subsoil in the E.    Locus 7 is the oven/pit in the SW.          We are digging Locus 4 using the baulk of D5 as a guideline to estimate any   slope. Locus 7 is being dug from the inside out in order to determine the extent of the ash pit. The pit seems to spread outwards the deeper we dig, suggesting perhaps a domed oven. While digging the pit, the soil changed from a solid gray ash to a mottled ash, charcoal, and orange brick. At this point, I closed Locus 7 and started Locus 8 in the pit. The ashy soil continues W into the baulk so much that it weakens the support of the baulk.   We have opened Locus 6 and completed its removal.

A mud brick structure was revealed after the last cleaning and after the floor is done that needs to be looked at. The wall exists in two steps, which we artificially imposed. It looks possible that L9 touches the wall. I had closed L10 and L11 however Bradley said I needed to reopen them to put the items from the dirt layer that still covers the floor in. I added three new KTs to both L10 and L11 for pottery, lithics, and bone. When we straightened the balks we were able to uncover a 1.3x.4m section of one of the floors above L9. This section is going to be L12 so that it can be sifted. L12 yielded no carbon samples after sifting. I came back to the tepe later this evening to continue working at the floor however I still had not found the edges. I think that part of the problem is that there is still too much soil on top of the floor; just a trowel is not getting through so I need to get one of the guys to come in with a small pick and take some off. We also had a staff change today. Mehmet has Typhoid fever so from now on his brother Ismil will be working.

I am having the guys bring down the soil in L10 and L11 3cm to make it easier to find. There is a rock pile in L12 which could be a feature. Lynn had mentioned yesterday that similar things had been found in D4. Bradley said he thought it was crap because it is so close to topsoil. As a compromise I had the guys pedestal it while continuing to dig L12. L14, the wall, has an unclear west edge. There are two possible lines. The floor abuts the outermost line, I dug up part of this looking for the floor to touch the cleaner inside line but that was not the case. The floor also appears to stop right at the edge of L11 (Northern edge of L11) this means that the pottery from L11 might not be context for the floor because it was not directly on top of it. But it is also still possible that the floor might continue and we haven_Ñét found it yet. In cleaning the northern part of the trench for photos of L9 and L14 it looks like we found another wall south of L9, this could explain why it stops. With all the new things that are being revealed in this trench I asked Bradley if it was alright if I spent the rest of the day catching up on and refining my locus sheets and my day plan. I started my day plan over (discarding tracing from yesterday_Ñés plan) and re-measured everything. While I was doing this Ahmet was cleaning a bare section in the middle of the floor where I hadn_Ñét been able to find the floor. Bradley said that if there wasn_Ñét floor there he wanted it taken out, as Ahmet was doing this he found the floor, it was about 1 cm deeper then the things directly next to it but seems to slant in from the south. This means that all the pictures I took earlier do not have the full floor since this section needs to be cleaned first. While Ahmet was doing this and while I was getting the level set up Ismil was clearing the ignored south west corner of the trench with a brush and uncovered more mud brick. Because this was done so close to the end I did not even assign it a locus number I simply too an elevation for it and will deal with it tomorrow.      ,~: D-8-2004-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 9,"1022,2004-07-11," E-2-2004-07-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench    Area: E   Trench: 2   July 11, 2004         Workmen: Meki, Taner Backus D.      Today we closed three loci: L11, L14, L18. In L14 we didn_Ñét find anything, which proves that this locus is pure fill at this time. As we estimated before L11 as not a wall, and we removed the floating stones and the mud brick as well. One of these stones appears to be grindstone. The most interesting spot in the sounding part of the Trench 1 is L18. We found large there amount pottery. Part of it, according to Bradley is Ubaid. We found couple big shells, well preserved and a loom weight (ceramic). Bradley suggested that this small find could be a spindle. We found also a strange artifact in the same level (approximately 587.00-586.94): a stone with not very deep concavity in the middle of it.   The purpose of this artifact is not clear. It could be appliance for making of fire. This artifact is well known among local people.       We went down about 0.10 m in L16 and so far there is no clear suggestion about any structure. At the same time L17 is more clear as wall or foundation of the wall. There is between the wall stones filling made by harden lumps small pebbles and mud.

A dark ashy layer of material running E-W, and flush to the N baulk, was noted, especially because we could discern no other features through it. The area identified by the surface line recorded as pit 5180 was begun with the intention of sieving one out of every four buckets given its potential size. However, the fill of the potential pit turned out to be the very similar to the surrounding fill either implying that the pit had been misidentified or the differentiation between the two fills was too difficult for us to make.      During the clear back of 5174 a new mud brick feature was identified (5181). We wanted it to be a continuation of 5170 but it appeared more likely that 5170 had been misidentified and that the northern area of the material above the floor (5169) lined up very well. Our plan is to excavate 5169 up to 5170 and assess any associations. If negative then 5170 will be discarded and the same process continued with a new locus for the material at the end of 5169.

During a previous season, a 1x1 m sounding and a subsequent T-trench were excavated, and an infant jar burial and an adult burial were uncovered in an EB context. Our hope is to get a clear idea as to the context of this area and since material from the EB was found so close to the surface, it maybe possible to uncover more extensive remains. We began to excavate L1, and quickly passed through the topsoil into a layer of fill. We only kept diagnostic pottery sherds, and several nail incised pieces are indicators of the EB. We recovered a lot of material, mostly occupational debris. In L2, we excavated the thin layer of topsoil and will level it off to the depth of L1 tomorrow. The soil seems to contain the same fill material. There is far less erosion here than in other areas of the site.

The feature (5185) that we had identified as wall abutting 5170 was partially excavated and it was decided that it actually represented a sloping floor surface and that 5170 was a thin layer of mud brick and a wall. We reclassified the locus and followed the floor under a large stone layer (5188) toward the east baulk. 5185 bonded with 5170 and we therefore hypothesized that 5169 on the south side of the wall was a lower floor layer.      Having excavated 5185 we decided that compared to 5169 it provided significantly more detail. One possibility we considered was that 5169 had formed part of a leveling process for the construction of the domestic architecture excavated in 2002 and therefore we had ended up with a series of mixed context layers.

Surface L1117 was successfully followed east where the last meter slopes at about a 35 degree angle until it ends abruptly 60cm from the east baulk. At this point L1119, a brown (7.5YR 4/4) fine clay/silt fill, was opened in the southeast corner of the trench since this fill is not suprasurface and thus different from L1116.   A baulk cleaning and cutting locus (L1118) was also opened and closed in order to better determine the exact breadth span of the surface L1117. L1118 was a light gray (5YR 7/1) coarse to fine angular clay containing large 30cm stones with smaller 5-10cm pebbles and stones running one meter along the south-southeast baulk.

Two carbon and soil samples were also taken.   In articulating L1117 I dug a little too deep and discovered a second superimposed surface below L1117. Thus surface 1117 will be removed down to this surface and a new locus will be created. Because this new surface is running directly below a level of fill that does not seem to be associated with L1117 and therefore not L1116, a new locus was created here, L1120, a light gray (7.5YR 7/1) fine to slightly coarse compacted silt.     ,~: F-1-2004-07-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1106,"1036,2004-07-13," F-7-2004-07-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7102,","   Area: F Trench:7      July 13, 2004       Sibel Torpil, Eser Karaca        The day started by taking the elevations.

The pot sherds that are showing up in this L7108 are demonstrating that we reached to the transitional period that is Late Chalcholithic and Early Bronz Age. ( Kt #13 of this locus should be checked out, the elevation is 569.09)    Besides that I decided to divid up L7110 into 4 equal parts. Part I and Part II are at the west side of the locus and Part III and IV are to the east side of the locus. We have removed 12 cm of soil from Part I and II. While we were removing soil at l7108 we faced a complet pot near to east boulk . It has broken pieces at the rim whole body of the pot. We don`t know yet if it is a complete pot or not. This is to be investigated tommorrow.    During our sweeping process I observed 2 hard mud-brick lines at L7110; starting at the North side of Part I and goes though Part II at the same locus.

Today we opened two new loci: L27, L28. It is in the North-West corner of the trench and cuts L16. It looks like animal hole, but has pretty smooth line from the North. That is why we think that it could be another structure like part of the mud wall or drain run. If the floor found by Cathy a week ago (L8) has something to do with the stone wall (L17), we may be have drain run in L28.   Besides that we closed L19 (big pit), and here Bradley suddenly saw two mud wall lines forming a corner in the North-East part of still open L20.   In the sounding area we opened L27. It is obviously fireplace, so we closed the locus. In the rest of the sounding area we found a lots of sherds, flint, obsidian, carbon and not seeable structure.

In the SW corner of the trench we had used locus 5169 to refer to the potential floor layer that could be seen in section under fill 5164. However, as we noted yesterday, the material in 5164 and below may well have been leveled during the process of construction of the domestic architecture excavated in 2002. having searched for a coherent sign of 5169 we decided that we would be working through secondary material until we came down below the foundation material of the 2002 architecture. We therefore assigned a new cleaning locus of 5190 to bring this material down to the level of 5167 in the SE corner of the trench. Having excavated 5190 we noted an area of lighter material (5192) and we will clean and spray tomorrow to assess this further.      In the SW corner we began to lower 5167 and revealed a floor (5194) similar in material, consistency and slope to floor 5185. 5194 also abutted a wall feature (5193) flush with southern baulk.      While clearing 5194 we came down onto a vertical layer of mud brick defining the pit 5180. We took a sample of this mud brick and excavated a small sounding to provide a section for 5164 and 5194 and lower layers and to assess whether 5180 was any deeper.      While excavating 5174 by 5cm to ward the south baulk we discovered a large pot, possibly an Ubaid period cooking vessel, that was partially excavated.

Today we were working chiefly on the higher level of trench. Here we closed L17, what was the stone wall foundation and opened four new loci: L29, L30, L31, L32.      L29 is a mud brick attached to the pit (L26), maybe part of the wall. It is very clearly outlined and it is located at the NE part of the big pit (L19).Because of the different color characteristic, we have split the rest of the higher level of the trench in two major loci: L30, L31, both as a fill. L32 is a little part of the fill in the NW corner behind the strange feature designated as L28. So far we don_Ñét have anything coming out clear.         We were tying to catch the lines of the mud wall in the sounding area (22). So far we can differ no more than three mud bricks and the rest of the wall looks very destroyed.

Besides that L7112 has been opened. It has to come to the same level with L7110. In addition to these I examined the North Baulk of F9. The northeast corner of F9 yields an ashy layer. Right now we are moving soil at L7110; part III and IV L7112 reached up to the same level with L7110 and 7108.    Our further investment will be getting 10 cm down at L7108.

It was thought originally that this locus was suprasurface fill but after excavation it was found to not be the case and in fact this psuedo-surface (still yet without locus number) does not continue beneath this fill.   Major concentration was spent on removal of surface L1117 along the south baulk. The \Household Archaeology Protocol\ (HAP) was used in excavating this locus with two 50 x 50cm square portions of the surface being selected as samples for microanalysis (KT4 and KT5) and a 2-liter soil sample was taken (KT6). The remainder of the surface was removed, measured in liter-marked buckets, and sieved entirely through a _\ screen. Materials retrieved from the sieve were given their own KT number (KT10) in order that comparisons might be made with other materials found within the surface during its removal (KT7-9). In total, 170 liters of surface were removed.   It was noted that a high concentration of animal bones were recovered from this surface, especially teeth.

Painter      This week_Ñés work was almost entirely focused on the articulation and removal of several surfaces throughout the trench. An elliptical cobble subsurface, identified from the 2002 season as L1104 now reassigned as L1112, and surface L1115 were excavated in the northeast corner of the trench. Notable finds from both loci included a stone grinder fragment (L1115 KT4), pestle (L1112 KT3), and tiny shell beads (L1115 KT3 and KT8). Another cobbled surface, L1113, was also excavated along the eastern baulk with pottery, lithics, and bone (KT4-6) being recovered. Based on their similar elevations and composition, I have concluded that surface L1115 and L1113 are in fact part of the same entity with a strip of fill (L1111) cutting between them.    Major work was also carried out in a suprasurface fill (L1116), surface feature (L1117), and subfloor fill (L1121) along the south baulk of the trench. Suprasurface L1116 was exceptionally rich with significant finds including worked stone needle fragments (KT10, 23, 25), a cache of 18 tiny shells (L1116 KT11), and more shell beads identical to those found in cobbled surface L1115 (KT5, 13, 23). Also what appear to be beaver jaws were also recovered from this suprasurface fill.   For the compacted pebble and crushed pottery surface L1117, the \Household Archaeology Protocol\ or HAP was used in order to gain a thorough contextualized sample of this surface. This protocol involved two 50 x 50cm sections (KT4 and 5) within the surface that were removed in total to be used for later microanalysis. A soil sample (KT6) as well as carbon sample (KT3) were also taken while the remainder of the surface was removed and every bucket sieved through a 1/4\ screen with a separate KT # being assigned to material retrieved from the sieve (KT10 and 11). Notable finds from this surface include a high level of teeth and jaw bones (KT9) trampled directly onto the surface and two bi- and tri-facial flint blades (KT1 and 2) recovered from the top of (but within) the surface itself.         ,~: F-1-2004-07-15-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,"1043,2004-07-15," F-7-2004-07-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7102,","   Area:F Trench:7      July 15, 2004      Sibel Torpil / Eser Karaca       The first thing that we did was to take elevations and then we divided L7109 up into is different locia. The reason of having 3 different locia was that the structure of the soil was changing, L7115 is located to the south-west of L7109 and it has a pale brown hard soil, but on the other hand L7117 has a totally different structure. It is much softer and darker in colour. The interstring thing about. This locus is that I observed that a hard brown-reddish mud-brick layer was coming up at the North-west corner of the locus. After breakfast I wanted Bradley to take a look at it. He agreed and he also made it clearer for me. We scraped it all the way from the west to east. After scraping it I observed that two lines are going to the east; these are the dividers of the mud-brick feature structure.    In addition to all of these in L7117 at the west baulk I found collopsed potsherds are standing above the other and at the top of all a metal needle was sitting. We labelled it as a small find the Kt 3 is 7. I contineed to articulate this collapse and during articulation I also picked up the loose ones. During this process I found a little bowl. This little bowl has been labelled as a small find too and its Kt # is 9.    The other thing that we have done today was to take out L7113. It has been carefully articulated and than it has been wrapped with cloth, and we carefully removed it from its place.    All in allour further investigations will took place at L7118.

The latter is being done with an experimental microarchaeology procedure _ÑÐ HAP. A 50 by 50 cm area is being collected for fine sieving. The rest of the floor will be sieved normally (1/4 inch screen) and this information, along with the normal collection of data will provide a more complete and variably scaled picture.   Because the surface is packed earth and not a layer of pebbles and sherds that will easibly be removed, we have chosen to remove 3 cm deep from the entire surface area for the HAP. In the 50 by 50 cm sample, this resulted in 6.5 liters of soil (KT7). Note _ÑÐ for the rest of the surface there are animal holes, but it produced 51.5 liters, making a total of 57 liters.   After the removal of the surface as a HAP sample, I_Ñéve switched to Locus 14, which covers the same area but is the packed earth/brick material beneath the HAP surface. Beneath this is an ash layer (Locus 16). Locus 14 has been divided into two parts. The northern part remains 14 but the southern bit is Locus15, because no ash layer is visible here. However, we did remove 10 cm of mudbricks from Locus 15.   We popped off some of the bricks in Locus 10 ringing the oven and it looks as if the ash continues underneath them.

More obsidian flakes and small pieces of animal bone were recovered.   L1106, the fill located in the northwest corner of the trench, was excavated 10cm revealing more coarse fill with no features. There is still cultural material present however such as animal teeth and cranial pieces (KT13) and obsidian flakes (KT15). New elevations were taken for this locus since work here has not been done in a number of days.   L1121 was also opened and excavated completely. This locus is the subfloor or subsurface fill from L1117 and was composed of highly coarse compacted light reddish gray (2.5 YR 7/1) clay in small dense clumps and &lt;5mm rocks. No significant finds from this fill, however both a carbon and soil sample were taken.   At the end of the day the entire trench was swept and photographed. The cleaning allowed Bradley and I to identify a lighter patch of dirt in L1111 in the northeast corner of the trench which could possibly be a mud brick feature. A line demarcated by ash running along a vertical line of this lighter dirt also indicates that this could be a wall. Future efforts will encompass exploration of this area.   Lastly a patch of darker soil east of L1121 and below L1119 may indicate a pit in this area.      ,~: F-1-2004-07-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1106,"1047,2004-07-15," D-5-2004-07-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5167,","   July 15, 2004      We noted large reddish flat lying potsherds in the centre of the trench within locus 5174. our assumption is that, together with the partially excavated coking vessel within the same locus, these may indicate a surface sloping from the southwest to the northeast. We excavated a 5cm layer across the entire locus and in the southwest area noted a color change from the brown fill to a areas where patchy orange was showing through. We also excavated a flat stone in the northern area of the locus that may represent the level of the layer we are looking for.      In the southeast area of the trench we cut a section through the mud brick lined pit (5180) and the fill layer 5190 to assess whether we should excavate the platform of material in the southwest corner (5190) more vigorously. We decided that no layers were visible and that this area represented fill beneath the domestic architecture revealed during the 2002 season. However, we also found another cooking vessel in northern area of 5190 so we decided to bring 5190 down by 5cm intervals, spray and check and move on if no visible differences were observed.

Eppihimer   Week 2 _ÑÐ ending July 15, 2004      The work that took place this week can be divided into three main areas:   The eastern half of the trench, where soil containing a topsoil/subsoil mix continues to be removed.    The northern part of the trench, where a large erosional fill sloping down to the NE has been identified in D9, D5, and in the baulk that they share. There are two pebble layers associated with this fill, but we were unable to follow the first during excavation. By the end of the week, the second layer was observable in D9.    The SW corner of the trench, where an oven and its associated surfaces and construction have occupied most of our time. Although initially we were not certain if the ring of orange bricks encircled an oven or an ash pit, excavation within that ring reached a depth of approx. 75 cm and revealed a well-preserved oven with a portion of its bricks baked solid. Inside the oven, four mudbricks were found ringing the floor of the oven _ÑÐ perhaps they served as platforms or pedestals. Outside the oven, a ring of mudbricks two courses high and two or more wide surrounded its top. A packed earthen surface atop mudbricks may run right up to this oven construction. A sloping layer of ash was traced underneath this area of mudbricks, leading to the speculation that the ash was deposited by the oven in an earlier phase and the area was leveled with mudbricks for a second phase, to which the earthen surface belongs. The pottery from inside the oven and from these two surfaces should help with these hypotheses as well as dating the construction, tentatively assigned to the Late Chalcolithic, although perhaps transitional EB.         ,~: D-9-2004-07-015-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,"1049,2004-07-15," E-2-2004-07-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 2,","   Daily Trench    Area: E   Trench: 2   July 15, 2004         Workmen: Meki, Turgut (Taner is ill) Backus D.

We found a lots of pieces of obsidian. According to Bradley the amount of obsidian found today exceeds the amount for whole week in KT. Variety of ceramics came out and the carbon as well. After sweeping the dist from the surface, appeared two or three ashy spots. This suggests that we are maybe in the complex of pits. The mud brick wall could be part of this complex.       We went down about ten cm in the higher part of the trench: L30, L31. Here we found just a few pieces ceramic. The workers were complaining that it is hard to dig the earth in L31.

The Household Archaeology Protocol was employed on floor 5185 that we considered to be equal to floor 5194 in the southeastern corner.      We removed wall 5170 and concluded that floor 5185 bonded to it whereas floor 5169 in the southwestern area of the trench may have been either crushed by the weight of the fill lying above it as an explanation for it being at a lower level than 5170 or that it was an earlier floor using similar constructive techniques.      A crushed but complete cooking vessel was partially excavated and associated with large flat lying sherds in the northern area of the fill layer 5174 so that a surface could be projected sloping southwest-northeast.

Eppihimer   Week 2 _ÑÐ ending July 15, 2004      The work that took place this week can be divided into three main areas:   The eastern half of the trench, where soil containing a topsoil/subsoil mix continues to be removed.    The northern part of the trench, where a large erosional fill sloping down to the NE has been identified in D9, D5, and in the baulk that they share. There are two pebble layers associated with this fill, but we were unable to follow the first during excavation. By the end of the week, the second layer was observable in D9.    The SW corner of the trench, where an oven and its associated surfaces and construction have occupied most of our time. Although initially we were not certain if the ring of orange bricks encircled an oven or an ash pit, excavation within that ring reached a depth of approx. 75 cm and revealed a well-preserved oven with a portion of its bricks baked solid. Inside the oven, four mudbricks were found ringing the floor of the oven _ÑÐ perhaps they served as platforms or pedestals. Outside the oven, a ring of mudbricks two courses high and two or more wide surrounded its top. A packed earthen surface atop mudbricks may run right up to this oven construction. A sloping layer of ash was traced underneath this area of mudbricks, leading to the speculation that the ash was deposited by the oven in an earlier phase and the area was leveled with mudbricks for a second phase, to which the earthen surface belongs. The pottery from inside the oven and from these two surfaces should help with these hypotheses as well as dating the construction, tentatively assigned to the Late Chalcolithic, although perhaps transitional EB.         ,~: D-9-5200-S0-71 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,"1053,2004-07-17," D-5-2004-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5181,","   July 17, 2004   Area F, Trench 1   C. Painter      Today I began by opening three new loci to account for the mud brick feature noticed at the end of the last work day. L1122 is a light gray (10YR 7/2) coarse, sub-angular clay/silt composed of small to medium clay clumps and &lt;5cm rocks located east of fill L1106 and directly west of L1123, the mud brick wall/feature. L1124 was also opened on the east side of L1123 running along the east baulk and is a very pale brown (10YR 8/2) compacted poorly-sorted coarse clay matrix.   The mud brick feature/wall, L1123, is composed of reddish brown (5YR 5/4) bricks running north-south and emerging from the north baulk in the northeast corner. In the north baulk profile it appears both L1111 fill and the cobbled surface L1113 lay on top of the wall.    Both L1122 and L1124 fill were brought down 10cm on each side of the wall in order to see how many courses are present. It appears that the wall/feature is only a single course composed of 7-8 bricks each roughly 30 x 45 cm in measurement.    In the process of excavating L1124, the north baulk of mud brick wall L1110 became clear that the wall had indeed finished and was therefore removed and the locus closed. L1128, a brown (7.5YR 4/4) medium moist clay, was assigned to the fill below L1110 and abuts L1124 on its north side. The east baulk profile of the trench confirms the stoppage of the mud brick L1110 and also shows a tiny inclusion (&lt;5cm) of darker soil within L1128.   With the subfloor fill L1121 being removed last time a new locus was assigned to the soil below this as L1125, a light gray (7.5YR 7/1) highly coarse angular clay. Today L1125 was excavated 10cm bringing it down roughly to the present elevation of L1106 and L1122. L1125 ends on its east side with an ashy deposit in the form of a thin strip running perpendicular north from the south baulk. This ash could possibly be against the side of another mud brick feature and will be investigated further.     ,~: F-1-2004-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1106,"1054,2004-07-17," D-9-2004-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,","   July 17, 2004      The first aim was to establish the length and breadth of the wall (5181) in the southwestern corner of the trench and to excavate the fill layer 5190 in perpendicular 5cm increments checking and spraying each time. The wall was constructed of large mud bricks with three courses and two rows visible.      Wall 5193 that had been initially seen as running for over 2 meters along the south baulk was excavated from its western end and found to be only 0.5 meters long and 0.12 meters wide. The slope of floor 5194 suggests that there is no articulation between these two features. The eastern section of 5190 was then excavated by 5cm and, after spraying and checking, like the western section revealed no new context.      A new locus of 5191 was given to the outstanding surface of the areas excavated as part of the oven _ÑÐ 5155, 5156 and 5157. On reducing this by 5cm a circular indentation between 5174 and 5191 was noted that corresponded with a grey area in the east baulk. This implied that the oven itself had been built on top of or into a pit. A wheel-made sherd found in 5191 suggested that the pit could be dated to the Early Bronze.      5174 was also partially taken back by 5cm to the north of the cooking vessel and the flat rock. A possible theory is that to the south of wall 5181 represents an interior space with the large rock in the south of 5174 a step for an entrance. 5174 would be an exterior activity area and the wall (5183) in the northwestern part of the trench a further structure.        ,~: D-5-2004-07-17 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5181,"1055,2004-07-17," D-9-2004-07-17 (2) from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9/Locus 6,","   Daily    Area D, Trench 9   July 17, 2004   M.

Today we were trying to figure out what is going on in both sections of the trench: sounding and the new trench. Ten cm below the level reached yesterday in L30 didn_Ñét give us much different picture than yesterday. We have still a huge mud brick on the right side of this locus and we don_Ñét have any significant changes in the soil color and soil_Ñés consistence.       In L31 we were going through heavily lumped hard mud. There is very clear horizontal line in the balk what is associated with this mud. I think that could be a mud platform.

After peeling off about 0.05 m from the current bottom of the sounding we found out that the ashy spots are not pits but fireplaces. We found again abundant ceramics and obsidian.

July 17, 2004      Today the main plan was to take lots of photographs of the trench and clear loci 9. We lost some time doing elevations and catching up on paperwork. We took one HAP sample for L9. After pulling up the visible sherd we took out a 50 cm square of the floor and put it in one bag. As we removed the rest of the floor we measured the liters that came out. There were a totally of 76 liters which comprised the floor L9. Two liters were taken as a float sample. All the rest was sifted and the sifted material was divided into two bags, one bag for larger chunks and one for the very very small pieces. One of the things that we pulled out was half of a loom weight which was made into a small find. While Ismil and I were sieving The other guys were going down 5 cm in Locus 26. We lost an hour at the end of the day when the tent pole hit me in the back of the head and I spent the rest of the day lying in the trench with ice on my head.

This locus contained eight (8) similar pedestal bowls (KT10).

This part will be demonstrated seperatly on a second day plan. I found out that two visible mud-brick lines are running from west to east. But to have it more visible use have scrobed it 3 cm more. After the scrabing process with Bradley`s help it became more clear that we are getting into an LC house.    The second invested area is the oven L7124. This locus started to show up yesterday afternoon. The scraping and articulating process demonstrates that it is acollapsed oven. But the questions concerning to the oven are creating criouslty in minds for instrance; obes it have a relation with the LC house is it independet? This questions will be investigated..    Besides this the south-east portion of the trench is totally changing. The locus # of this portion was used to be L7113, now it is getting to be L7126. This locus is all over covered with cobbles; in other words it can be said that a surface/floor is coming up. With in this locus during scraping and sweeping we have found two little pits which are located to the southeast of pit L7103. They are not bigger than 0.50x0.50 cm. One of them is filled with lime and the other one seems to be stuffed with ash. These two pits do not have locia #`s yet cause we found them at the and of the day.

Eppihimer      Now that the full extent of the oven has been determined, I am working to lower the platform around it to the level of the rest of the trench. Keeping in mind our hypothesis that mud and bricks are packed around the oven, we are leaving a ring around it, which will be dug separately from the rest of the platform. A reddish brown color predominates, but the ring around the oven is more brown/brick-like. L 21 is the general platform area including the small patch of L17 pebble layer, which we could not trace any further back to the S-SW because it had already been cut through. L 22 is the ring around the oven. If the section is to be trusted, the entire platform save the immediate vicinity of the oven is fill.

The KT_Ñés have been separated. For now we are keeping the area between the orange line of bricks and the oven untouched, hoping we can come at the bricks from the side and see if/how deep they are. The removal of 15 to 20 cm from L22 around the oven has exposed the ring of burnt bricks that form the innermost wall of the oven structure. One measure 10 by 10 by 20 cm.   The orange line of bricks has become a 5 cm thick layer of orange bricks that slopes downhill from the SW to NE. We are following this by exposing it and then popping it off (with progress photos of course) so we will know its extent in the negative. Beneath the bricks is a more ashy and loose soil.

Today we took away the weird  hing\ (L28) from the upper left corner of the trench (NW), between L31 and L32. It turned out that huge muddy looking belt is crossing diagonally the trench, South-North. Now it looks more likely that the mud structure with width 1.50 m is a wall. It is associated with the mud wall going into the balk. Here we opened new locus: L35.   L30 still looks like fill. The big mud brick in its right side (L29) didn_Ñét associate with anything and we gave up on it.      In the sounding area we are going through very rich layer in L24 and L25: very much sherds among pebbles and small stones (L: 0.07 m, W: 0.04 m average). Again we have a lots of obsidian and variety lithics including one stone ball. In left (South) part of the sounding we reopened L22 as L33, because we found out that there is continuing mud brick structure below L22. From the North side of this wall it was a pit (L34) or fireplace. It looks like we have cut this pit much earlier and today we have reached its bottom. A huge piece of obsidian came out from here: L: 0.06 m, W: 0.045 m. In the middle of the L25 we found remains of another fireplace.

Painter      Today I began by bringing L1125 down 10cm to better examine the nature of the comact soil in the southeast corner of the trench. Based on color and textural differentiations, two new loci were assigned here: L1126, a pinkish gray (5YR 7/2) fine to medium silt abutted on the west by an ashy inclusion. L1127 which is east of L1126, is a light gray (5YR 7/1) coarse subangular fill.   It was initially thought that the ashy inclusion was abutting another mud brick wall, perhaps the continuation of L1123 south. This turned out not to be the case as both loci (L1126 and L1127) were plagued with various animal burrows, in the case of L1127 a 5cm diameter hole plunged straight down into the locus perhaps 10 or more centimeters deep.   Based on the similarities in color, composition, and general lack of any visible features on the surface post-sweeping, both L1106 and L1122 were closed and a new locus, L1129, was opened over the entire area abutting the wall L1123 on its west side. L1129 is a dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) fine to medium silt or fine clay composed of small dense clumps and a few &lt;5cm pebbles.    A large pick pass was done to bring the locus down 10cm and level with L1125. This accomplished not only a higher accumulation of pottery and bone that in L1106 and L1122 combined, but also revealed another course of mud brick in L1123.   10cm was also excavated out of L1124 and based on the fine composition of the soil, this locus could possibly be inside surface fill.   Lastly L1128, fill below mud brick wall L1110, was closed as the soil color and texture in this area now resemble that of L1124.

We followed this down and ended up with a hole approximately 50 cm deep. This hole, now L27, was not specifically a pit but appears to be fill up against wall L23.

Afterwords we started to articulate the LC house. L7121 has same collapsed mud-bricks which colour is changing to 2.5YR3/3 dark reddish brown. Besides that when we were remaing soil from L7115 the lives of a pit should up. The L# is 7127. It is not going wery deep. We have articulated it and sweeped it, it seems to have a cobble surface beneath it.    On the other hand we continued to articulate the LC house. The intersting thing is that the locus 7118 has collapsed mud-brick, which might have been fallen from L7121. The other surface that is showing up is located to the southwest corner of the trench. This area was the portion where the previous excavator was hoping to find a pit, but it did not. Instead of having a pit I have reached to a cobble surface. The locus # of this area is 7128, and is below L7110 part I and part III.    Our investment on the LC house will continue tomorrow. We have to come down at L7118 which is the interrior part of the LC house and it is bordered by L7121; the mud-brick wall.

Painter      Today I continued to excavate fill L1129 ten centimeters more along the west side of wall L1123 to better gauge whether or not the mud brick is continuing. 20cm total was simultaneously excavated in fill L1124 on the east side of L1123 for the same purpose. It appears now that the wall is truly only one course sitting on top of dark brown moist fill similar to that of L1129 and L1124. No major finds recovered from L1129 save for a large amount of animal bone (a leg bone was found in situ) in the northeast corner of the locus.   In the southeast corner L1126 and l1127 were both closed and a new locus, L1130, was opened directly in the southeast corner of the trench. L1130 is a strong brown (7.5YR 4/6) fine silt pit with heavy ash and carbon inclusions and a ring of ash on its outer edge. I was able to excavate ~30cm and already clear stratigraphy is visible on the east and south baulk showing multiple subdivisions within the pit characterized by a dark ashy level, a silty brown layer, and then another ash layer. Multiple soil and carbon samples were taken. Thus far a small amount of bone and pottery sherds have been recovered. Based on its elevation and location in the southeast corner, it is hypothesized this ash pit could be the continuation of a Chalcolithic oven excavated in the northwest corner of F4.

The excavated area was thus about 4.25m. We pushed pushed locus three down a bit further to be sure we were out of subtopsoil throughout the entire trench. Then we changed to locus 5 because it was clear that we were now in occupational debris. Within this area we identified a softish area in the middle of the trench between two more compacted areas in the north and south. After digging the entire area as locus 5 for a while we were able to more clearly delineate three different areas of soil in the trench, which we then divided into locus 6 (hard, bricky in northern end of the trench), locus 7 (soft, ashy, pitty like area in the middle of the trench), locus 8 (compact area in the southern part of the trench; not wall-like but mixed occupational debris). It is not clear if locus 6 is indeed a wall or not, and spraying it with water did not clarify the situation.

Painter      Today I closed L1123 by removing the mud bricks down to the fill layer beneath. A sample mud brick was retained for flotation. The fill below the wall was designated L1132, a dark yellowish brown (10 YR 4/4) medium coarse clay with small to medium dense clumps and &lt;5cm rocks. In color and composition this locus is similar to L1129 and L1124.    Below L1132 a 60cm long ash line/inclusion was noticed arching west from southeast to northeast in the south end of the locus. It is possible this ash line is associated with pit L1130 in the southeast corner of the trench.   Pit L1130 was further excavated with the continuation of high levels of ash and carbon. Both soil and carbon samples were taken (KT10-12) as well as pottery (KT8) and bone (KT9). Notably vertebrae pieces were recovered and curiously what appears to be a thick/heavy vertical burnished chalice or footed pedestal bowl fragment characteristic of the EB but certainly uncovered in an early-middle Chalcolithic context inside the ash pit.   Based on the soil texture and presence of small limestone inclusions in L1125 and L1129 as well as the fact that little or no cultural remains had been recovered in the past 10cm, a 1 x 1 meter sounding level (L1133) was sunk 15cm into L1129 in the center of the trench. This produced the same dark yellowish brown (10 YR 3/4) very moist fine clay as the surrounding L1129.    Because a single pot sherd (KT1) was found in L1133, a second 15cm deep sounding level was opened and designated L1134. Here the same soil texture and color was present with no cultural material and a higher concentration of limestone inclusions allowing me to conclude that we are in virgin soil in this area (L1129, L1125) of the trench.     ,~: F-1-2004-07-20 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1/Locus 1123,"1076,2004-07-20," E-2-2004-07-20 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 2,","   Daily    Area D, Trench 9   M.

Another mud wall seems to cross the trench from SE corner into L35. Bradley thinks that all three walls are part of one and same construction. One possibility is that this is edge of fortification wall with foundation for the tower.       In the sounding area we found out that the mud brick wall (L33) does not continue underneath.

Discussed with Dr Parker the possibility that this trench is now exhausted in Ubaid features if not in pottery, lithics and bone.       We decided on a two stage plan. The first was to sink a sounding 1m x 1m in the southwestern corner of the trench (5202) and by 15cm increments assess the stratigraphy against the continuation of the south and western baulks and possibly find natural (virgin soil). Another possibility was that the orange show-through of the fill in 5198 did represent an interior surface and that 5197 was exterior to a new, if poorly defined, domestic structure. 5198 revealed a a floor surface of thick mud and large rock inclusions to be continued tomorrow.      5201, the collapsed mudbrick feature was started and sectioned for time reasons.

To the south we designated the area as locus 10, possibly outside the domestic area.      In the central baulk we noted three courses of bricks above the level of locus 9. To the west of locus 9 the mudbricks were well defined in plan but we decided to conduct a surface scrape by 2-3cm to the east of the locus to see if we could define them across the entire wall. However, the mudbricks were still not visible and we decided that the wall possibly slopes to the east or continues as a step.

Because of this we are in a precarious position in this trench. While to goal is to clearly define everything that we can this year, we also want do not want to start anything that we cannot finish.    The area now assigned as L42 was not a floor. As we were excavating it became clear that if anything it was the hard packed sub floor of what had been on top of it, floor L32. So L42 is that area which was not floor and L 45 was the definite floor area. Because L45 was so pitted and hard to follow quite a bit of its sub floor came off in the same locus.   When L45 came down to the level of the top of L30 we could clearly see the continued outline of the fill. We changed L30 to a pit designation and then excavated the newly uncovered section pulling out a few small finds as well as more slag and mud brick chunks. It appeared that L27 was the other edge of that pit and it had cut through the wall. However towards the end of the day after we had taken off approx 15cm of L23 we found more clearly defined mudbricks within the pit area. So L30 cannot be a pit and L27 cannot go with it because there is a wall in the middle. We followed the line of the wall out into the area that is the bottom of L33. Here we found large paving stones which appear to be mud brick. The floor, L41, of which only small pieces were found, appears to be on top of it. Right at the end of the day we were trying to follow these bricks and see where they go. It appears that they come up almost to the edge of L30 in a straight line; it also appears that there is another corner of wall brick in the area where L45 was. This could mean that there was a room in which L30 was the fill and the slump from the walls kept the edge from being discernable when we were digging L30.

By the end of the day we had defined locus 14 and we cleaned the trench and took photographs. On top of locus 14, within locus 10, we found three or four chalcolithic sherds for analysis.

Trench 5.      Introduction      D 5 is a continuation of the 10 x 5m trench last excavated in the 2002 season on the eastern slope of Kenan Tepe. At the end of the 2002 season the trench was divided along north-south lines with excavated features of Ubaid domestic architecture (including L5139, L5140, L5149) and an oven (L5126, L5127) in the southern section. However, there were a limited number of features in the northern section, except for a human burial (L5137) in a later pit in a slip trench in the northwestern area. At the beginning of the 2004 season there was an expectation that these Ubaid features might overlie an earlier phase of habitation in the form of a separate house and that the northern section of the trench might also provide additional Ubaid contexts with further excavation. To further investigate these possibilities a new parallel 6 x 4m trench, D9, was also opened to the east of D5 aiming to capture any continuation of the Ubaid contexts.      Summary of the excavations      The primary method of excavation was by the use of small picks to strip 3-5cm increments of material from tightly designated areas with troweling employed during the fine excavation of surfaces and features. Where possible each surface was also sampled following guidelines set out in the Kenan Tepe Household Archaeology Protocol.      On average, during the 2004 season the level of the trench was lowered to 586.13m in the northern section of the trench and 586.52m in the southern section from average starting levels of 586.8m and 587.15. However, in the last three days of the season a 1 x 1m sounding (5202, 5203, 5204) was excavated in the southwestern corner of D5 with a final level of 585.31.       As a guide the northern and eastern baulk sections provided an idea of the orientation of the paleo-landscape of the eastern side of the Tepe - pronounced ashy layers in the northern baulk and a layer of gravel in the eastern section that makes a sharp dip downward at approximately the 2m mark from the northern baulk. The ancient slope of the hill ran in a generally southwest to the northeast direction.      As a result of this it will probably be more useful to summarize the excavations in D5 by dividing the trench into a southern, a central and a northern section. The main reason for this is that the ashy layers in the northern baulk section showed as a blackish line running northwest-southeast across the trench. As the excavation continued from south to north we were therefore progressing \downhill\ in stages.                The southern section of D5      This section was characterized by thick layers of fill (5164, 5167, 5190) between the 2002 contexts and significant features especially in the southwestern section of the trench. During troweling it was possible to distinguish boundaries in this fill through consistency and compactness of material leading to the hypothesis that this area had been artificially leveled in advance of the construction of the 2002 Ubaid house. These fill levels were contained by wall 5170 that followed the orientation of the 2002 west-east wall although this feature had only a thin horizontal slice remaining and was not connected by any mud brick courses to the wall above.      Although the Ubaid domestic context had been divided into interior and exterior areas in the 2002 season the 2004 excavation revealed a number of floor surfaces (5169, 5185, 5194) that were initially considered to be interconnected. These were different from the compacted silt surfaces of the 2002 season in that they were readily visible as compacted silt and pebble layers and the overlying fill could be slowly levered off with a trowel. Although floor 5169 in the southwestern section was relatively level in terms of the orientation of the trench both 5194 and 5185 sloped from west to east into the baulk shared with D9. During excavation it was also noted that 5185 bonded with wall 5170 but that this wall overlaid 5169.      In the southeastern corner of the trench the Ubaid contexts were cut both by the edge of the oven found in trench D9 and by a mud brick lined pit (5180) both of which were later period.      There was therefore no clear evidence of an earlier Ubaid structure, although the surfaces, pits, layers of fill and wall suggested the 2002 house had gone through a number of construction phases.      With the lack of evidence for a separate house it was decided to test the hypothesis that the 2002 house was resting on virgin soil and a sounding (5202, 5203 and 5204) was dug in the southwestern corner of the trench to a depth of 1.3m below the final locus level (5197). However, as well as continued pottery finds, in the eastern section of the sounding pieces of mud brick showed through between 75 and 80cm below the level of 5197 and two pieces of corrugated tile (KT2, 5204) were recovered from the lowest level.      The central section of D5      The preliminary dominant feature in this area was the oven excavated in 2002 as a tripartite structure _ÑÐ a central core (5156), a surround of fill (5155) and a hemispherical section of mud outer-walling (5157). Although the oven had been proxy dated to the Ubaid from a spatially adjacent feature_Ñés carbon sample a surface scrape of the central core immediately showed two potsherds that implied that the oven might be later. The central core was therefore excavated as a series of layers (5171, 5173, 5178) that were derived from a section cut from the front of the feature (5172) and pottery and carbon samples collected for analysis.       Although 5157 contained mud brick debris the oven structure in trench D9 provided an outline of how a later oven might be preserved in section with a thick beehive of ashy material and distinct mud brick layers for the surrounding containing wall. The eastern baulk section for the D5 feature showed that the central core was the active element of the tripartite structure and it was not clear whether there was a surrounding ashy fill that had been contained within a constructed outer shell. The excavation of the fill surrounding the core suggested that this material was similar in color and consistency to fill encountered in other areas of the trench and not primarily ashy. Having excavated all the features of the oven a circular indentation was noted that identified locus 5191 as a pit. The hypothesis was therefore that the oven was actually the central core area alone and had been built onto or into an earlier pit.      In the western section there were a number of indicators that this area had been used as an activity area in the Ubaid period (5174, 5198). Firstly, it underlay the chaff-covered surface from the 2002 season and abutted wall 5181. Secondly, as the excavation proceeded it followed a south-north slope identified by flat-lying sherds and a complete decorated cooking vessel (KT40, 5174) and a smoothed stone (KT8, 5199) under which grain impressions were preserved.      As more concrete proof a thick layer of rocks, 1.5 x 1.1m in area, embedded in compacted silty material was excavated and HAP sampled. This contrasted sharply with the floors in the southern section of the trench in area and description of material within the silt.      The northern section of the trench      The aim in the this area of the trench was to excavate beneath the thick ashy layer noted in the northern baulk section and to assess whether this layer provided a useful stratigraphic indicator of the boundary between the Ubaid and later periods.      Two walls, one below and one resting on the ashy layer were noted toward the end of the season. 5183 rested on the ashy layer and was associated with Chalcolithic pottery (KT9, 5199). 5201 was only visible in plan except in the half-section of pit 5201 where mud brick outlines were recorded beneath the ashy layer.      A notable find in the northeastern corner of the trench was an inscribed cylinder seal or bead (KT10, 5182) inscribed in a zigzag pattern in two registers.      Interpretation of the results of the season      Although there are limited opportunities to discuss dating a general summary of hypotheses could be put forward. The southern section of the trench revealed interior features that were part of an earlier phase (or phases) of the 2002 house that were then covered with fill to provide a level base for later occupation.   Associated with this is the hypothesis that the activity area in the central section of the trench, exterior to the house, was also used before the chaff-covered surface of the 2002. However, it seems unlikely that the cooking vessel and the smooth stone grinding surface would be abandoned, although any ritual explanation would be hard to argue.      The later pits and the oven along the eastern side of the trench imply that this area is associated with trench D9 rather than with the Ubaid and again it is worth considering the slope of the ancient hill which may have moved further eastwards over time. Therefore during the Ubaid the side of the hill may have been more flush with the 2002 house and then, having been filled in over time, employed in a more \industrial\ capacity in later periods.      Another possibility connected with the slope of the hill is that wall 5201 in the northern section of the trench may act as a retaining wall rather than in any domestic context and, if Ubaid in date, be associated with the exterior activity area to the north of the 2002 house.      The results of the excavation in D5 in the 2004 season have therefore been determined by the transformation of the shape of the hill in requiring the leveling of areas in earlier periods and the shaping of the Tepe by human occupation that allowed new areas to be exploited.     ,~dc-terms:title: D-5-2004-07-022-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"1089,2004-07-22," D-9-2004-07-022-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,","   Weekly Summary   Area D, Trench 9   Week 3 (ending July 20, 2004)   M. Eppihimer      As was the case during the previous week, the majority of time in trench D9 was spent working around the oven in the SW corner. Pottery reading confirmed that the oven dates to the Chalcolithic. The question of its construction was still unanswered, so we alternated digging the general area to the N and E of the oven and a ring around the oven that allowed us to examine the relationship between the oven walls and the soil that surrounds it. First, the ash layer under the mudbrick leveling platform was removed (Locus 16). Underneath was a muddy redbrown fill (Locus 21). The mud around the oven continued down until the bottom of the oven walls, which sat on something that looked like re-deposited virgin soil. While removing the mud, a thin line of orange red bricks running SW-NE was observed to the E of the oven. Further examination showed a 5 cm thick layer of bricks that sloped downhill (Locus 28) SW-NE that sat atop a 1 to 2 cm ash layer (Locus 27). Neither of these features could be connected directly to the oven.    As the walls of the oven were removed (Loci 10 and 22), its circumference expanded, confirming the beehive shape. It expands into the S baulk, into the W baulk, which was removed, and into D5. To establish the full diameter, the W baulk was cut down and excavation was extended into D5. The diameter at the oven_Ñés base is 1.40 m.    Inside the oven, the four protruding bricks were removed; beneath them was an ashy layer. When all of the ashy soil was removed from the oven interior, the packed mud floor sloped downhill from E to W. To determine that we were indeed at the bottom of the oven walls, some of this floor was removed and the bottom of the burnt brick walls was found. During the removal of the baulk between D9 and D5, a pebble surface (known in D5 as L5194) appeared beneath some of the mud. Tracing this to the edge of the oven, it seemed as if the oven was cut into the surface. If this surface is Ubaid, as D5 suggests, then we can confirm that the oven was cut into earlier levels. The trick is determining where the earlier levels stop and the Chalco surface begins. Pottery reading from the loci around the oven are key to this issue.   Once the oven excavation was complete, we decided to close down the trench, rather than continue to excavate fill.           ,~: D-9-2004-07-022-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,"1090,2004-07-22," F-7-2004-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7121,","         Area:F Trench:7,      July 22, 2004      Sibel Torpil / Eser Karaca       Today it is the last day of the season. Because of this reason we tried to hurry. Our first aim was to take out the mud-brick wall L7121 . We wanted to be sure on taken of the mud-brick wall L7121 was sitting on. We have taken of the mud-brick wall with trowels and we have observed that the wall was sitting on an ashy layer L7132. Besides these I have removed the oven L7124. Little amount of potsherds came out of it. The construction material of the oven seems to be highly burned. During removing and after sweeping the L7124 I was able to observe that the whole oven was located on an ashy layer . But this ashy layer is not the same as the one in L7132. This different ashy layer makes us think that there is no connection in between the oven L7124 and the so-called Late Cholcolithic house.    In addition to these I have opened two locia numbers. These two new locia members. These two new locia numbers belong to two pits which are sitting on L7126. But these two pits are to be investigated in the season of 2005.    All in all we have cleared and swept the entire trench, then I have taken the last photos of the trench, and by taking 42 elevations of the trench use have closed the trench for this season.     ,~: F-7-2004-07-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7121,"1091,2004-07-25," F-1-2004-07-25-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,","F-1-2004   Final Trench Summary, Year 2004 Season   Area F   Trench 1   July 25, 2004   C. Painter      Introduction   Trench 1 of Area F is located in the \lower town\ area of the mound approximately five meters east of trench 7 and directly northwest of trench 4 so that the northwest corner of F4 and the southeast corner of F1 are separated by only a half meter baulk. The trench measures 4.5 x 4.2 m and was roughly 3 meters deep when I began excavation. F1 had been previously excavated in three different seasons (2000, 2001, 2002), therefore the goals for this season were to further examine the various cobbled surfaces that were left unexplored from the 2002 season and to expand on any more Chalcolithic period architecture or features that may be present.       Initial steps involved the renumbering of key loci remaining from the previous 2002 season including the bottom levels of a small ash pit in the northwest corner (old locus 1090, new locus 1107), a dense rectangular pebble surface along the south baulk (old locus 1102, new locus 1109), a mud brick wall running west out of the east baulk in the southeast corner (old locus 1069, new locus 1110), and an elliptical cobbled surface emerging from the north baulk in the northeast corner (old locus 1104, new locus 1112) with a span of fill on its east side (old locus 1100, new locus 1111). A locus number was also assigned to a narrow strip of cobbled surface running along the east baulk that was also uncovered in the 2002 season but not fully excavated. Lastly initial efforts were focused on leveling the trench with small picks within the main fill locus (1106), whereas previous loci 1102, 1103 and 1095 were all of differing elevations at the close of the 2002 season.      In the process of leveling, a small ash pit (1107) and ashy fill deposit (1108) were excavated with trowels in the northwest corner. It appears that 1107 was the remains of a previous pit or oven installation that had not been fully excavated last time. Only 5cm of the ash remained and revealed only one body sherd. 1108 was equally as shallow (1-2cm) and perhaps served as residue from the adjacent ash pit. Because of the relative shallowness for both loci, screening was not performed.      Excavation   The largest efforts involved the articulation and excavation of cobbled/pebbled surfaces throughout the trench. An elliptical suprasurface fill (1112) and cobbled surface (1115) remaining from the 2002 season seems to have been a foundation level for mud brick wall 1096. The relationship between this cobbled surface (1115) and an adjacent cobbled surface (1113) is evident in their matching elevations and similar composition where a layer of light gray fine silt/clay fill (1111) cuts between the two surfaces. Unfortunately this cobbled surface layer did not extend south enough to connect it with the mud brick wall (1110) which was still present at this elevation and is therefore not bonded or associated with any other wall features.      The other major area of superimposed surfaces was located in the south-center end of the trench along the south baulk. The topmost surface (1109) containing cobbles, pebbles, and crushed pottery in a medium poorly-sorted compact clay matrix was articulated and removed with small picks to reveal a larger coarse compact subsurface/suprasurface fill layer (1116) containing hardened clumps of light reddish gray clay and crushed pottery. Because this fill layer was especially rich in cultural material, every fourth bucket was sieved through a _\ screen and soil samples (KT19 and 21) were taken.      Once this fill layer was removed a second surface (1117) containing pebbles, crushed pottery, animal bones and lithics in a coarse compact clay matrix was exposed and almost covered the entire south baulk. Once this surface was articulated with trowels, it was excavated using the \Household Archaeology Protocol\ or HAP in order to gain a thorough contextualized sample of this surface. This protocol involved two 50 x 50cm sections (KT4 and 5) within the surface that were removed in total to be used for later microanalysis. A soil sample (KT6) as well as carbon sample (KT3) were also taken while the remainder of the surface was removed, measured in liter-marked buckets, and sieved entirely through a _\ screen with a separate KT # being assigned to material retrieved from the sieve (KT10 and 11). In total, 170 liters of surface were removed.       Again this surface (1117) did not extended to the mud brick wall (1110) but instead ended with fill levels on its northeast (1120) and east (1119) sides. Subsurface fill (1121) was also excavated by trowel and was on top of another light gray highly coarse angular clay fill layer (1125) whose eastern edge was bordered by a narrow arching strip of light ashy inclusion. At first it was hypothesized that this ash bordered a mud brick feature, however after excavation with small picks of brown fine clay/silt fill (1119), a pinkish gray medium silt fill (1126) and a light gray coarse sub angular fill (1127) in the southeast corner, it was discovered this fill was sealing a semi-circular ash pit (1130) that was cut 50 cm into light yellowish brown fine clay/silt fill (1131) later identified as virgin soil.      This ash pit (1130) was located directly in the southeast corner with slight ash inclusions filtering into fill 1131 into which the pit is cut. The pit contained heavy amounts of carbon and ash with subdivisions composed of alternating dark brown and ash layers evident in the east and south baulk. Extensive soil (KT2, 5, 10) and carbon samples (KT1, 6, 7, 11, 12) were taken. Based on the location of this ash pit and the bottom elevation, it is hypothesized that this feature is a northern extension of ash and carbon residue from a large circular oven (4009) excavated in F4 in the northwest corner of the trench. That both the F4 oven and the F1 ash pit are dug into virgin soil (in F1 represented in fill 1131) further strengthens this argument.       Fill (1111) north of the ash pit in the northeast corner continued to be excavated by small and large picks after the remaining mud brick wall (1110) was found to have ended and was removed. Stratigraphically the wall was above both the final cobbled/pebbled surface 1117 along the south baulk and the ash pit 1130 and was therefore only connected with previous surfaces excavated in the 2002 season.      When another mud brick wall (1123) was reached inside fill 1111, this latter locus was divided into 1122 on the west side of the wall and 1124 on the east side along the east baulk. The wall feature was roughly 3 meters in length emerging perpendicular from the north baulk in the northeast corner of the trench. It was composed of a single course only with 7-8 bricks, average size of 30 x 45 cm, bonded together with mud plaster. Both fill areas 1122 and 1124 were excavated with small picks for at least 30cm in order to gain perspective on the nature of the wall and if any associated floors or surfaces were present. In the end however no such features were uncovered and the wall itself as one course was subsequently removed.       At this point, no visible features were discernible in the homogenous fill prompting me to assigned one locus for the majority of the northwest corner of the trench (1129) while retaining fill 1124 along the east baulk and fill 1125 along the south due west of pit 1130 and surrounding fill 1131. Large picks were used throughout 1129 with less and less cultural material being recovered and no features emerging. It was then that a 1 x 1 m sounding level (1133) was opened in the center of the trench cutting 15 cm into fill 1129. A second sounding level (1134) in this same location was also excavated 15 cm and by the profile in this sounding I was able to ascertain that virgin soil, characterized by moist dark brown fine to medium silt/clay with limestone inclusions, had indeed been reached in this area of the trench and that further excavation could discontinue in fill 1129.      Fill 1125 had also experienced a gradual lessen of cultural material until the last 15 centimeters removed with big picks and shovels retained no artifacts or features and was characterized by the same moist dark brown clay with limestone inclusions. 10-20 more centimeters were excavated in fill 1124 to be sure that virgin soil has also been reached along the eastern edge of the trench. In these lower levels of 1124 ashy inclusions on the south end of the locus near to fill 1131 and pit 1130 appeared and again are most likely associated with the extension of oven 4009 from F4 via ash pit 1130 in F1.      Small Finds   Small finds within F1 helped greatly in the interpretation of the several cobbled/pebbled surfaces as domestic or activity area contexts within these lower levels of the trench.    Stone grinders and pestles were recovered from the elliptical suprasurface fill 1112 (KT3) and cobbled surface 1115 (KT4), pebbled surface 1109 (KT4), and suprasurface fill 1116 (KT14 and 20). A large number of lithics, specifically obsidian debitage and flakes, were also recovered from surface contexts, notably two trifacial flint blades (KT 1 and 2) found side by side in situ within pebbled surface 1117. Worked stone needle fragments were also found in suprasurface fill 1116 (KT10, 22, 25).      The most delicate of finds discovered in surface contexts were several tiny shell beads coming from cobbled surface 1115 (KT3, 8) and suprasurface fill 1116 (KT5, 13, 23).   A loom weight was also found within surface 1109 suggesting further domestic activity.   Lastly it was noted that high levels of animal bones including teeth and jaw bones on top of surfaces and within the surfaces themselves were present. Though awaiting final analysis, one jaw in particular (L1116, KT9) resembles that of a beaver and hints further at the nature of both flora and fauna in this area during the Chalcolithic period.         Baulk Profiles and Drawings   Only the east baulk section was drawn this season and encompassed not only the levels that I excavated but a complete redrawing of the entire section including levels from the previous 2000, 2001, and 2002 seasons. This involved a cutting back of the baulk 15 cm from the level of the burn layer (1037) that encompassed the entire trench. A complete drawing of this east baulk section was essential for giving a full picture of the stratigraphic sequence within F1 and the early to later Chalcolithic levels and will greatly aid in further research of this time period.      The baulks sections also aided me in interpreting connections between loci that were not necessarily evident at the time of excavation. For example, the east baulk clearly shows the discontinuation of mud brick wall 1110, however directly underneath separated by a 5cm wide clay inclusion, was a lighter brown mud brick (1128), perhaps the remains of an earlier wall that was leveled and built on top of or is simply a continuation of wall 1110. The curvature of ash pit 1130 in the baulk profile is connected with another level of darker fill (1127) which subsequently extends to the base of this lighter mud brick (1128)    suggesting an association between this mud brick wall and the pit.       The occurrence of cobbled surface 1113 inside the east baulk and surface 1115 in the north baulk resting directly on top of mud brick wall/feature 1123 reinforces the fact that the mud brick wall was completely in disuse or simply leveled in order to facilitate the construction of cobbled surface 1115 which later served as a foundation level for wall    1096, a feature which framed further cobbled surfaces and a southern mud brick wall enclosing a domestic area excavated in 2002.      A final note includes the south baulk, specifically the extension of pebbled surface 1117 along the southeastern section. In excavation the surface continued into this corner area but at a 35 to 40 degree angled slope downward before ending abruptly. Evident in the south baulk profile there is a slight possibility that this surface was perhaps connected elevation-wise with the very top of the corner ash pit. I however remain skeptical on this point as the surface and the pit do not actual abut either within the loci themselves or on the baulk section though the possibility for the surface at this point not being preserved (perhaps due to the activities revolving around the oven) is still possible.       Conclusions   This final season of excavation within F1 revealed several key contexts in analyzing the role of household production and domestic activities during the Chalcolithic period at Kenan Tepe. The occurrence of culturally-rich compacted surfaces and suprasurface fill highlighted the nature of these activities which included food production as evident in the presence of grinders, pestles, obsidian and flint tools and blades, as well as high levels of animal bones including teeth and jaws. Cloth production and needle working is also evident as seen with several stone needle fragments and a loom weight. The small collection of shell beads retrieved can perhaps also be included within this group of needle-worked craft.       Overall the examination of these domestic-use finds in regards to other surface contexts in neighboring areas (F7 and F4 for example) will enable a fuller picture of household activities throughout the site. The occurrence of ash pit 1130 in F1 further connects this trench with the F4 oven and subsequent contexts that might also relate to household production.      Lastly with the completion of excavation in F1 (i.e. reaching virgin soil), a full stratigraphic sequence for the Chalcolithic period in this trench is possible and reflected in the incorporation of four seasons worth of excavations into a single composition east baulk section drawing.      ,~dc-terms:title: F-1-2004-07-25-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 1,"1092,2004-07-25," D-9-2004-07-025-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,","D-9-2004   Final Trench Summary   Area D, Trench 9   Kenan Tepe 2004   July 25, 2004   M. Eppihimer      On July 4, 2004, a new six by four meter trench (D9) was begun in area D with the goal of reaching Ubaid levels that might correspond to those of the house in the adjacent trench, D5. The trench is located to the east of D5, sharing a southern baulk line. The west boundary of D9 is the same line as the east boundary of D5, but D9 is only six meters long, whereas D5 extends to ten meters. Because of their close proximity and a desire to obtain as much exposure as possible, a 30 cm baulk was kept between the two trenches. Towards the end of the season, the southernmost part of this baulk was removed (see below).   At the start of excavation, the trench sloped downhill to the E considerably with up to 1.7 meters difference. Locus 1 removed a significant amount of soil from the western part of the trench in an effort to begin to level the trench and to come closer to the levels that were of interest. Once we had reached an appropriate level, we divided the trench into two halves. The western half (Locus 2) consisted of fill, whereas the eastern half (Locus 3) was a mix of fill and topsoil/sub-topsoil. At this point in time, the eastern boundary of the trench had not been set. Both loci 2 and 3 were dug as 25-30 cm arbitrary levels.    The eastern baulk of D5 provided a useful guide for the next stage of the excavation. Where a thin, sloping line of pebbles and yellowish green soil in the baulk rose to the bottom of Locus 3, we extended an east-west line as a divide. The area to the north (Locus 4) was composed of mudbrick debris. The area to the south (Locus 9) was also bricky, as viewed in the baulk, but nothing could be defined. Another divide (a split between mudbricks) in the D5 baulk separated Locus 9 from Locus 5 to the south. An arc of orange bricks in the southwest corner of Locus 5 provided the first indication of the oven that would become the focus of the season. These three loci (4, 5, 9) were restricted to the western half of the trench, as the eastern part was still mixed with topsoil (Locus 6). This would be the case for the rest of the season, with the eastern boundary of the trench remaining in sub-topsoil.   In the northwest part of the trench, we concentrated on finding and tracing the two sloping pebble layers visible in the D5 baulk. Unfortunately, we had little success. We worked with the hypothesis that, although in the baulk they sloped down to the north, they also sloped downhill to the east, considering the shape of the tepe. The first layer was cut through during the removal of Locus 4. A patch of the second layer (Locus 17) was later located and did slope down to the northeast as expected. Perhaps it continues beneath the elevation of the area at the end of the season. In between the two layers was a large, sloping area of erosional fill (Locus 13) that extended into D5. This area was initially Locus 12, but the number was abandoned when it was accidentally extended too far to the east and became mixed with topsoil.   The west central part of the trench offered only a mysterious circle of loose brown soil with bricky material inside (Locus 19). Digging from the east in towards the circle through an ashy soil (Locus 18), the area did not appear to have any substantial identity, leading to the conclusion that the circle was an animal burrow. However, after sweeping this area towards the end of the season, the circle remained and its insides were still hard and bricklike (Locus 29).    The rest of the season_Ñés work concentrated on the oven in the southwest corner of the trench and its associated features and surfaces. The excavation of the oven was divided into three operations: 1) clearing the ashy soil inside the oven, 2) determining the nature of the oven construction, and 3) examining the surfaces and fill that surrounded the oven. With the arc of orange bricks as a starting point, an oval perimeter of mudbrick was traced and the ashy soil within the mudbricks was removed (Locus 7). At about 25 cm deep, a change in soil from gray ash to a mottled ash and orange/brown soil with carbon and burnt brick pieces was noted (Locus 8). As the soil was removed, the interior surface of the burnt brick walls of the oven appeared. At a depth of about 0.5 meters, the tops of four bricks laying flat inside the oven and a mudbrick shelf around the interior walls were found. Beneath these was a layer of dark ash that rested atop a packed mud floor (Locus 30) that sloped downhill east to west.    Once we reached the end of the ash in the oven, we began to take down the walls of the oven by keeping a 0.5 m-wide ring around them (Locus 10/22). At first, we were able to identify an occasional mudbrick, but more often we observed mud packed against the burnt oven walls. As they were removed, the shape of the oven expanded into a circle (1.4 m diameter) that extended into the SE corner of D5 (Locus 20). In section, it resembled a beehive. The bottom of the oven walls sat on redeposited virgin soil (Locus 32).    The third operation regarding the oven was to examine the soil to the north and east of the oven. Beneath the larger mudbrick/mudbrick debris area of Locus 5 around the oven (which was popped off from the D5 baulk where possible) was a thin ash layer resting upon a packed earth surface (Locus 11). This surface ran directly up to the walls of the oven on its north and northeast sides (but not southeast), indicating some association with it. The surface was removed as a 3 cm thick HAP sample, which required a 50 by 50 total collection sample, a 2 liter soil sample, and sieving of the rest of the soil. Below this surface was a layer of mudbricks (no courses or rows were definable) (Locus 14) sitting upon a second ash layer (Locus 16). Like the L11 packed earth surface, Locus 16 did not appear in the southeast, which remained full of mudbricks/mud (Locus 15). Beneath Locus 16 was muddy fill (Locus 21).    Because of its excellent state of preservation (walls approx. 0.8 m high), we developed the hypothesis that the oven was cut into something or well-protected by mudbrick or mud packing. Both situations are likely. A patch of Ubaid pebble surface (Locus 31) that was excavated in D5 (L5194) was cut by the oven construction. The mudbricks of Locus 14, however, were packed around the oven, perhaps as a leveling platform with its packed earth surface (L11) associated with the oven_Ñés use. Regarding the sequence of the oven_Ñés construction and use, it is not clear if the lower ash layer (L16) is associated with the oven. If it is, then it marks a first phase of use, after which the area was leveled using mudbricks (L14) for a second phase (and second ash layer). The pottery from inside the oven was Late Chalcolithic. The pottery from loci 11, 14, 16, and 21 that have been read contain few diagnostic sherds, with only L16 having one painted Ubaid sherd that cannot date the locus.    The contemporary local village ovens provide an ethnographic parallel for the oven construction. They are thin walled, beehive shaped ceramic ovens that are surrounded with cinderblocks and mud packing. The opening at the top is smaller than the general diameter of the oven and is slanted. A small stoking hole rests upon ground level. No stoking hole was found in the D9 oven; if one existed, it might remain in the portion of the oven extending into the south baulk.   The last feature of note in the trench is a 5 cm thick layer of orange mudbricks sloping downhill NW to SE (Locus 28) with a 1 to 2 cm thick layer of ash underneath (Locus 27). This was excavated by popping off the mudbrick layer to reveal the ash layer. The ash layer extended for more than 2.5 meters N-S. By the end of the season, its eastern extent had yet to be determined. No link was uncovered to definitively connect these elements to the oven construction.   Before closing down the trench, the area was swept to define new loci for the rest of the trench, including Loci 23, 24, and 25, three areas of fill in the north part of the trench and Locus 26, an area of fill in the SW corner around the area where the oven was.    The southern baulk of the trench, which contains a section through the oven, was drawn on July 24, 2004.      Small Finds   With so few closed contexts, most of the small finds from this season are not contextualized. A pot disk (KT D.9.20.4), a clay token (?) (KT D.9.20.11), and two pieces of burnt clay that may have been packed against a pot (KT D.9.20.12) came from the inside of the oven. From the topsoil and subtopsoil: two andiron fragments (KT D.9.1.2, D.9.1.5), a ceramic spindle whorl (KT D.9.1.6), an animal figurine (KT D.9.4.9), a crucible fragment (KT D.9.6.12).

This is the trench summary for Trench D8 for the 2004 season. D8 is a new trench this year. It is situated to the south of D5 and east, or downhill from D6 and D7. This trench was intended to be a ten by five meter trench. The grid lines are somewhat off what the overall tepe grid scheme would indicate. this is because the south D5 balk has been creeping back every season and if we had strung the D8 balk lines where the total station indicated they should be the balk between the two trenches would have been very thin which would have risked the lives of everyone in D5 because the trench is so deep. Because of this we used the total station lines as a guide and strung the trench so that there is a full meter balk between D8 and D5. This means that we took the full meter of balk room off of the north side of the trench so the south balk line lies directly on the grid lines.    Because this was a brand new trench we spent the first three days just getting the trench ready and moving topsoil. We started in the northwest corner of the trench which was the point of highest elevation. The topsoil was removed in curved sections. These topsoil loci were tailored to the curvature and slant of the tepe. On July 4, the first day of digging, we divided the whole trench into three sections which would be the steps. Loci 1, 2, and 3 were that first step. There are multiple loci because we were adjusting the balk lines and each adjustment necessitated an additional locus. Loci 4 was a rock area that disappeared into the west balk and L5 was the second step. the third step was topsoil and we did not assign it a loci number because we knew we had a lot to do before we reached that level, as it turned out the south east corner of the trench is still topsoil. Loci 4, originally the rock pit soon became a long column of rock and broken pottery which was changed to loci 6 with loci 7 the area south of it in the first step and L3 continuing in the first step to the north of L6. L6 was a wash or drainage ditch. It disappeared midway through the first step. Though there was a lot of pottery in this locus it was so close to topsoil that there was really no good context for it. overall the first step was brought down a full meter and a half from the height of the north west corner (590.11) to the closing level of Loci 7 and 3 (588.66.) The loci were changed because under the wash material of L6 we found a cobbled surface (L9.) This cobbled surface continued north but made a straight edge at what had been the south border of L6 now the north border of L11 (previously L7.) L10 was the soil that still remained on the cobbled floor. On July 10th we found an area of mudbrick in the north east corner of the trench. The mudbrick turned out to be a corner of a building which makes a square with the balk lines of the trench. This wall (L14) existed in both steps of trench. There is an artificial line through one of the rows of bricks which was made by our excavation methods as opposed to any architectural feature of the wall. L13 was part of another cobbled surface which had been on top of L9 which we found when we were straightening the very crooked balk. The section we found was approx 40cm square. L12 was a third step which we created within the boundaries of what had been L5 but also extended out further to the east and south taking some topsoil with it. L15 was designated as the area inside of wall L14 and is a rectangular area in the very northeast corner of the trench. Within L12 a large area of rock which we originally thought might be a pit became L16. L16 turned out not to be a pit and is designated as a feature. For a few days we continued with these loci using picks to move as much dirt as we could. In many areas we were still in top soil or sub topsoil. The next discovery was some mudbrick in the south west corner. This area of mudbrick, L17 is a wall which is still in the trench. The construction of this wall (brick size ect.) seems to match that of wall L14. However they are on opposite sides of the trench. To the south of L17 between the edge of L17 and the south balk there was an area that appeared to be made of burned mudbrick with an ash pit in it. To the north of L17 more brick material was found. When we finally excavated this area (L22,) it became clear that this was mudbrick slump most likely from wall L17. When we had the floor L9 completely uncovered we could see a very clear line where the floor ended. This straight edge of the floor butted up against what appeared to be another wall. This area (L19) appeared to be wall and was sandwiched between L9 and L14. At first this was puzzling but when we excavated L19 we found that it was not an entire wall. The only wall area was directly up against the floor (wall L34.) L19 was mudbrick slump mixed with pottery which was both on top of L34 and between it and L14. We had placed a sounding L31 running east west through L19 and part of L14 to figure this out. We discovered another wall at the south border of the floor. This had been loci 11 but was changed to L23 for the wall and L24 as the fill to the south. There was an undefined area between Loci 19, 9 and 23 which was L18 and then 7cm deeper L25. With all of the areas around the floor fully assigned and documented we removed L9. Uncovering, documenting, and then removing L9 was a time consuming process. We took a HAP sample from this Locus. This is also one of the only loci whose pottery was read and the floor turned out to be 2nd millennium though there were several pieces of type 7 3rd millennium high fire green/yellow in there. L9_Ñés sub floor was soil (L26.) We were going through L26 with small picks because the soil was so hard packed and because of this we missed part of another floor L28 which was under it. L28 was the floor which we found in the southern half of the area which had been L26. L29 was the sub floor which we hit in the northern part of that same area. In L24 we found what first appeared to be a pit (L30.) this locus was much softer than the surrounding soil. This pit butted up against Wall L23 and by taking it down we were exposing the south side of wall L23 which was needed because though the material felt like brick we could not find definite brick lines. There had also been an area of very fine and soft soil (L27) to the north of wall L23 which was fill up against the wall. L24 became L32 after we hit the pit. We also opened up L33 which was the remains of the second step from the original excavation. The purpose of taking this down was to even out the trench so we wouldn_Ñét have as many arbitrary breaks and steps. However before we could accomplish this we hit two areas of cobbled surface L41 and L47. There appeared to be part of the same floor though there were separated by over a meter of space. The sub floor of both of these loci was visible. The sub floor (L46) is large paving stones. There appears to be a line where the bricks stop near the eastern edge of L30. Through a succession of loci (32, 42, 45 and 48) the area south of L30 was brought down to the same level as that of L46. Because the floor was not contiguous we could not follow it. So we decided to follow the sub floor bricks (L46) to see if they would connect L14 to L17. L46 is connected to wall L23 and we found parts of floor L41 touching wall L14 At one point we had decided to remove wall L23 and as we were taking it out we found defined bricks. These bricks appear to be construction like that of L17 and L14. We were most likely looking at hard mudbrick slump on top of the wall. In the balk we can clearly see the triangular shape of the slump. It appears that L23 slumped on top pf L30. To follow the bricks we had to take out L16 and as we were doing that we hit L49 which was a cache of large pieces of broken pottery and one pedestal piece. We had been trying to follow the brick lines of L46 on the last day of excavation but we were prevented from doing so by finding L49 In the northwest corner of the trench another wall is visible as lines. This wall does not line up (either perpendicularly or parallel) with Wall L14 or 23. One part of this wall touches L14, it does not touch L23. L34 was on top of this so it is unlikely that this wall and its associated surfaces (L43 inside, L35 and 38 outside) are connected with L14 and its associates.    \tWith what we have currently excavated it looks like Walls 14, 17 and 23 all go together. They are connected by the sub floor L46. L30 which at one point appeared to be a pit is actually fill inside a room. L23 is the northern wall of this room. There are two more walls (east and south) which are currently visible only as lines. It is unclear if wall 34 and floor L9 which go with one another go with the rest of the currently visible architecture. At the beginning of next season the first thing that we should do is to thoroughly clean the entire stretch between the walls to make sure of their connection. The large pits that were created by the excavation of L16 and 49 will hamper this somewhat but it will still be possible. The most notable finds from this trench were several animal figurines. One which came out of L15 was found right up against the wall and still retains its head, and appears to be a cow or ram. There were also a large number of fishnet weights and in L16 two grinding stones. Overall there was not a lot of household items which may suggest that the majority of the trench is a non workspace, possible a street or area between buildings.

Baldi      We began the day by adding a tent over the trench to increase shade after which I explained to the workers that we needed to work faster. Following this we began by straightening the baulks with the hand picks and followed with the large picks by taking the trench down another 15 centimeters. Other than a slight color change I have not observed anything to warrant a locus change. Normally this would have been enough, but we want to quickly go under .50 meters before making the change. Pottery observed is still minimal. Once we reach the goal of .50 meters depth I will change locus and begin a general collection of relevant materials. Granted this transitional point we seek to identify may be arbitrary at this point but we want to get there as fast as possible. Too much time has already been taken in getting to the current depth.   After using picks, shovels and handpicks to cut the trench down another 10-15 centimeters we began to see more ceramic sherds which signals a good point to change to locus 2.    We came back to Kenan Tepe to work on various things. On my trench I placed Meki, Siddik, and Lokman to hack away at the surface with the large picks and working on the baulks. These guys are a good combination to move lot of dirt fast. We collected pottery, bone, and lithics, now coming in greater quantities. Somme structure began appearing near the southwest corner of the trench and was quickly identified as a wall. We may have cut some of it (5-10 cmts) on the northwest quadrant of the trench but will be unable to verify until we clean up a lot better tomorrow as we began to run out of day and light. Needless to say I stopped work on that side of the trench but continued excavating the east quadrants. The work was completed in about 2.5 hours and much was accomplished. As mentioned it got too dark for photos and measurements. This is partly the reason for the supplemental daily plan.         ,~: H-2-2005-05-011-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area H/Trench 2/Locus 1,"1096,2005-05-16," E-2-2005-05-16 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 41,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   May 16th, 2005   J.

We also cleared the topsoil off a 2.1 meter area from the southeastern baulk, enlarging the trench to 5 x 5.9 m. This will allow us to have a larger view into the lower levels of the trench. This locus (L41) was mixed topsoil created by erosion on the tepe, and because it lacked good context, we removed it quickly. Only a small animal figurine (KT 1) was kept from this locus, although a few sherds of EB pottery were identified.      In addition, we removed the pillar of dirt from the northern corner of the trench that had been left from the previous season. It contained layers of the layers of the 2nd millennium street, but otherwise obstructed our view of the baulk.       Tomorrow, we will begin to dig in the other loci, in an effort to eventually remove walls (L43, 42 and 46), which crisscross the trench.

Painter      Today was an extremely short workday due to the worker_Ñés \strike\ so, unfortunately, very little was accomplished.      Due to the baulk cleaning, new measurements of the entire trench were taken. The new trench dimensions are 9.3 meters north-south and 9.8 meters east-west.      Several loci from the 2004 season are still present including pits 7127 and 7103, fill 7131 and 7135. L7135 is ashy fill beneath L7121, a mud brick wall associated with a Late Chalcolithic date structure. Part of this wall remains on its eastern edge and will need to be removed as this locus was closed in 2004. Pits 7121 and 7103 also seem to have been closed in the previous season, as there is no indication that they continue.      A pebbled surface in the SE corner of the trench that was uncovered in 2004, but not given a locus number at that time, was assigned as L7138 and will be excavated tomorrow.      I also opened L7139 in the SW corner of the trench consisting of arbitrary boundaries 4.1 meters in length and 4.5 meters in width. Before the close of our short workday, elevations were taken in L7139 with the F1 datum that is located adjacent to the SE corner of trench F14. The datum elevation is 570.64 and the height of the level instrument today is 572.26. The F1 datum is the elevation I will be using for this season.      Lastly I noticed a possible feature_ÑÓtwo mud brick wall tops perpendicular to each other and possibly forming a right angle (90 degrees) corner. One wall is running east from L7134, a cobblestone feature uncovered in 2004. L7134 could be associated with this wall, though this remains to be explored. The second possible wall is running north-south along the east baulk and is 70 cm west of the east baulk.

Today we will continue removing soil, especially from the northern baulk area.      I want to explore the possible wall stub of locus 2 along the midline of the western baulk. The wall stub contains one ground stone door socket. Unsure if used for a door socket at this time or reused as a wall cobble. There is a small and rather poor pebble surface below the stub.      Well, there is a workmen_Ñés strike today. I am unsure how long work will last. There was almost a fight in my trench. The young men that came to work yelled back to the other man from Baris_Ñé trench from yesterday. Apparently he came to fight and my men wanted to take him on. Hopefully we can get some work done.      I exposed more of the locus 2 wall stub. I need to bring a towel to tear up to mark the extra stakes from my trench. We marked it out as a 10x10m so that we can expand if we want. I didn_Ñét feel comfortable starting with such a large trench so it_Ñés a smaller one for now.      We began to take locus 1 (the top soil locus) down from the north moving south. Succeeded for about the top quarter bringing it down the next 10cm.

Also, there is an exposed bone sticking out of the baulk in the lower part of the NE corner of the trench.      We began by taking 10cm off of L9023.

Henecke      There was no work yesterday due to trouble with the workmen, and today, I began by removing the large mudbrick wall (L42) crossing the trench from the southwestern to the northwestern baulk, which had been left from the 2004 season. While excavating the wall, we recovered many pottery sherds _ÑÐ identified from a variety of periods _ÑÐ and many good lithics. Beneath the wall was a floor surface with pebbles and flat lying sherds. The wall sealed the surface in its original context, and it is possible that the floor extended beyond this area but was blown out by later deposits. A large bowl fragment lay on top of the surface and when analyzed may indicate the date of the locus. Many of the sherds found associated with this new locus (L50) seem to be from the Ubaid period. It is possible that the Ubaid levels in this trench begin much earlier than expected, although they may have arrived in this position if older deposits were used to construct the floor.       While I prepared the floor for a HAP and soil sample, we began to excavate L44, and beneath a thin layer of soil, we discovered a second pebbled floor surface. It appears that this floor surface may be similar and related to L50, although the two are not directly connected except in the baulk. The link between the two may have been blownout in antiquity or during excavation. There appears to be on coarse of mudbrick beneath the southwestern end of the L44 floor surface, although its size and shape will be unclear until we remove the entire locus.       We also began to excavate the eastern side of L49, which is a continuation of disturbed fill soil. We uncovered a largely complete bowl within the fill. I excavated this half of the locus in order to determine how far L43 extends, and although there appear to be slight color distortions, it is impossible to definitely associate them with the wall at this point. It is noted that the outline wall L43 appears in the northwestern baulk to a height of about a meter above its current position.            ,~: E-2-2005-05-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 42,"1107,2005-05-18," G-9-2005-05-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9/Locus 1,","   Daily Trench    Area G   Trench 9   May 18, 2005       Today we will continue with the plan from yesterday that was interrupted from the strike.

Just below locus 3 in the southeast corner of the trench (and quite close to the surface) we came across two in situ complete vessels. They are early bronze, but amazingly undamaged for being so close to the surface. Bricky material is appearing close to it. Maybe there is something there this close to the surface? There is shattered pottery all around this area, but nothing appears to be a surface. Nothing is flat lying.      In the northeast corner of locus 3 is a human burial.

In the NE corner, there is a grinding stone right next to a medium sized broken pot.

Baldi      After some early consultations between Dr. Bradley Parker of the University of Utah, Dr. Bekir Gordil of UCLA and I about where to place the next trench (H-2) as I joined the excavation today, we decided on Area -H- situated Northeast of the main tepe mound. It was decided to excavate area H as it is an area which has not been excavated, with the exception of a small 1 by 1 meter deep sounding conducted in the 2001 season by Sibel Torpil of Bilkent University at Ankara. The almost 3 meter deep sounding was never re-opened and Sibel_Ñés notes indicate a small quantity of ceramic on the initial layers which are the same conditions I encountered today. Sibel also located human remains, but so far today we have not. The new trench was laid about 4 meters due Northeast of the H-1 sounding. Bradley helped in laying out the 5 by 5 meter square with a .50 meter baulk. With the two workers assigned to H-2 Mehmet Tahir Erkek (age 27) and Ridvan Bozcalli (age 17) we began cleaning and digging out the top layers of fill using the large pick and shovels. The work is slow and it is a hot day. We will see how much is accomplished at the end of the day. The plan was to take the trench down 50 centimeters today. I selected a location about 20 meters away where the hill drops off for our dirt dump.    The nearest altitude datum point is located in area -G- at 574.65 meters above sea level. The area within the trench is not at the same level and exhibits a difference of almost 40 centimeters between the SE and the NW corners. I hope to level the trench down to about one half meter today and decided not to collect anything on this overburden layer designated as Locus # 1. Our overall research question is for this area will be an attempt to ascertain its relationship to the main habitation areas already located on the main tepe, or perhaps even those of the nearby lower town known to us as area -F-. As the work has progressed throughout the day I have observed extremely low quantities of ceramics, which may be a characteristic of a premium area of cultivation.    A short while after breakfast a third worker was assigned to H-2 Tarik Ozturlu (age 16) and he was mostly used for wheelbarrow duty; needs a lot of training.

A ground stone (KT# 15) appearing in L.5206 does not look in horizontal position but it may indicate domestic activity, if not thrown away.      In L.5207, we may have an area with plaster surface, although I did not open it yet. In my opinion, we are excavating a dumping area in this locus that was filled mostly with mud-brick pieces and small number of artifacts. In addition, there is a small area with the mixture of gravels and coarse sand.      Work in L.5209 showed that there is significantly small number of artifact recovery and the soil consist of very clean mud as fine clay. The gravels in this locus are not laid horizontal implying the lack of a surface.       Overall, work in the trench was slow due to small number of workers and setting up the tent over the trench.                                                                                ,~: D-5-2005-05-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5206,"1116,2005-05-21," E-2-2005-05-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 43,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   May 21st, 2005   J. Henecke      Today we cleared more of L49 (fill level), and we were able to articulate more of mudbrick wall L43. There is a scattering of ash on the southwestern side and the remains of mudbrick slump on either side. The wall fades out on the extreme eastern end because of erosion from the upper part of the tepe. We discovered a few ceramic pieces from a tandor oven in the eastern half of L49, but there was not enough ash or pottery to clearly discern an oven (KT14). They are probably not in their original position, although it might have been nearby. In the western half of L49, pressed against wall L43, was a grouping of pots , apparently in primary position. They appear whole and seem to be both leaning on the wall and resting on a floor level that is not yet visible. They are just outside of the erosion line, although there is the chance for mixed content.       We also cleared the floor L44 _ÑÐ sifting all soil, although I did not keep a soil sample because of its similarity to L50. We need to remove the subsurface to determine if the mudbricks, which were found last week, continue underneath.      Beneath the L50 surface and L46 fill locus is the possible foundation of a wall (L53), composed of large stones and mudbrick slump. Lying in the gap between the L44 and 50 surfaces, this wall may either lie beneath the floor levels or be associated with these surfaces. In order to determine this relationship, we need to remove the L50 subsurface (L52).     ,~: E-2-2005-05-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 43,"1117,2005-05-21," D-8-2005-05-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 52,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   May 21, 2005      Today started with bringing the southern third of the trench, an area approx three meters by four meters starting at the south balk, down 10 cm. This is the first excavation of loci 52 which was assigned on Thursday (5-19-05). The excavation began with big picks. As it is being brought down we are also attempting to make the surface level. The inexperience of the workmen makes this somewhat difficult. The trench perpetually slops as it approaches the eastern balk where the soil is softer. Early in the morning we found the base of a pot, turned upside down and slightly slanted. We continued to excavate down another ten meters before we were able to pedestal the piece of pot and see the bottom edges. It is a very large base and is broken about 5 cm down from the bottom rim. This rim is potentially the bottom piece for the large pieces which were pulled out of loci 44 on the last day of last season. Approximately half a meter from the broken pot base was a grouping of sherds from the same pot. It does not look like there are enough present for it to be reconstructed. From preliminary examination it appears to be a dark burnished piece. After breakfast we took elevation and began to level out the center third of the trench. The raised areas around loci 30, the large pit, were considerably higher than the other areas of the trench. We had to make several passes throughout the day with the small picks to even it out. In the center area we pulled out several small finds. These were: a small loom weight; an animal figurine with no head; and a tiny shell bead. The day ended with trying to even out the east balk which is not at all a straight line.         ,~: D-8-2005-05-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 52,"1118,2005-05-21," G-9-2005-05-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9,","   Daily Trench    Area G   Trench 9   May 21, 2005      Well we are still removing locus 3, the subsoil below locus 1.      Locus 6, the top fill of the tannur, contains a good deal of tannur fragments so the top of the tannur must have collapsed in onto itself. The dirt is becoming softer and more ashy. The tannur fragments are continuing down 10cm within the tannur. Small rocks and pebbles are also in the fill. I will take a dirt sample for floral analysis about 15cm down. I have come down on cobbles and pottery sealing off the inside of the tannur. So I will start a new locus (8) for the cobbles and below.      The dirt of locus 8 (below 6) is highly compact in some areas and loose in others. Many of the stones coming from this locus are cracked, possibly from heat exposure. The inside of the tannur does not appear to be very burned. As I get lower down the dirt is becoming more ashy and black. Bradley thinks that perhaps the locus 6 fill was unintentional and the locus 8 fill was intentional on the part of the users of the tannur. I also took two floral samples from locus 8. Carbon samples were also taken. There were no diagnostic sherds within the tannur. But it was located below the fill that had EB pottery in it.      There are bricky patches in the northern area of the trench. Perhaps we are coming down on something.

Since the 2001 season, F9 has become extremely contaminated with outside material. This week was a pretty short week but a lot of dirt was moved.      There are two main features to discuss thus far however. One, L9030 appears to be the side of a large pit, which explains the heavy ash layer in the Northern baulk of L9027. Compare notes with F7 next week because if this accurate the pit should continue into that trench.      The second feature that I will be looking into in more depth is a possible wall in L9031. We at first thought it was clearly this feature but now believe that we may have misinterpreted it because the layer to the East of the wall appears to be similar coloring. I will pay more close attention next week and see what we can unearth.     ,~: F-9-2005-05-21-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9027,"1120,2005-05-21," G-7-2005-05-21 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 7/Locus 16,","   Daily    Area G, Trench 7   May 21, 2005   Baris UZEL          Today, we dug L24 area three times.

In L9027, we discovered a corner of wall with floor right where what we thought was a wall in L9031 would have ran. We have now realized that the coloring of the level in L9031 was due most likely to the wall falling over. I renamed the corner of wall in L9027 to L9033 and the floor to L9034. See pics 4 and 5 on camera V on this date.      I am now working on brining L9032 down 10cm at a time to see if we can find architecture. After going down 10cm, we found what could be part of a stone floor in the center of the locus. I noted this on my day plan and photographed it, but do not want to make it a separate Locus until I am sure.

Painter      Week 1      The primary concentration for this week was the removal, leveling, and renumbering of old loci from the 2004 season. Erosion from the past year was not heavy, still the baulks were cut back and new dimensions of the trench were taken. There are currently 9.3 x 9.8 meters.       Since all the loci were closed or removed last season and no distinguishing features became evident after our initial surface scrape, the trench was subdivided into four quadrants with L7139 (last season_Ñés L7129, 7128) occupying the southwest corner and L7142 (last season_Ñés L7131, 7121, 7135, 7132, 7123, 7125, 7124, 7123, 7117, 7115, 7127) occupying the northwest corner. It should be noted that both these loci, 7139 and 7142, are arbitrary locus dimensions. Since there was a great need to level elevations from the last season in the western half of the trench especially, I concentrated in this area to begin with, leaving further work in the eastern half for next week.      Other loci remaining from last year were still present and heavily eroded/damaged. They include a cobble stone feature L7141 (last season_Ñés 7134) and L7140 (formerly 7133), both of which were examined and subsequently removed this week. Pit L7143 (last season_Ñés 7137) was also excavated with no finds remaining inside. A heavily damaged pebble stone surface (L7138) that was uncovered in the 2004 season but never given a locus number was also recorded and removed.      Thus far the only defining features have been ashy deposits in the northeast corner of L7139 and what appears to be the beginning of an ash pit similar to that in trench F9 located along the south baulk of L7139. L7143 could also be considered an oven or at least a pit in which burning occurred. This coupled with heavily burnt pottery from pit L7144 suggests either pyrotechnic activity in this area or in the vicinity with purposeful deposits of the refuse as opposed to a large-scale conflagration.     ,~: F-7-2005-05-22-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,"1123,2005-05-22," E-2-2005-05-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 43,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   May 22nd, 2005   J. Henecke      Today I concentrated on clearing the pottery group (KT5-12, L55), which lies near mudbrick wall L43. I uncovered a mud floor beneath the pots (L60), which appears burnt in the western half. The fill above this surface was a mixture of ashy soil, collapsed mudbricks and carbon. There is a clear join between floor L60 and wall L43, and the pots rest on both loci. I collected the inner contents of all the whole pottery for further analysis. The pottery seems to extend into the southwestern baulk. At the same time, I removed L48, which was similar to the soil on the southeastern side of wall L42 and floor L50, although more ed. By doing this, L47 expanded into this area, and now covers most of the western half of the trench. Upon removal of L54, we discovered that the mudbrick wall only extends for 2 rows to the north (L59), and is most likely mudbrick slump from stone wall L53. Also, stone wall L53 passes beneath L50 and 44. Another grouping of large stones was found in the western corner, but it is as yet impossible to correlate the two. Finally, in L49, we discovered a pebbled surface in the northern corner (L56) and a feature with ash and mud besides it. This locus and feature lie close to the area where the oven pieces were discovered yesterday, and they may be a part of this installation. The floor covers such a small area that it provides little information, and we are not able to correlate it with any other loci in the trench.           ,~: E-2-2005-05-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 43,"1124,2005-05-22," F-9-2005-05-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9027,","   Daily Trench     Area F   Trench 9   May 22, 2005      Started in L9031, evening out the Locus. I wanted to explore L9036 (the possible rock floor) more, so I am scraping away the northern part of L9032 to see if it reveals anything.      A reddish coloring has appeared just to the north of L9036 abutting the locus. I am going to scrape the area down to reveal this reddish coloring more and I will reevaluate the loci numbering then.      I have also realized that there was a pit in the NW corner of L9032. But unfortunately, I did not recognize it in time to give it its own Locus. The findings are therefore mixed with the KT bags of L9032. There was however a much higher concentration of bone in this corner than anywhere else in this locus.      Next, I took the southern half of L9032 down to see if anything turned up. I found more of the rock floor of L9036, confirming that it was a surface. I spent the rest of the day working on this locus. It currently runs just to the west of the wall that is L9035 and I believe there might be a wall just on the other side of this rock floor, meaning that it could be a narrow passage way between architecture.           ,~: F-9-2005-05-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9/Locus 9027,"1125,2005-05-22," G-7-2005-05-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 7/Locus 16,","   Daily    Area G, Trench 7   May 22, 2005   Baris UZEL          We started to dig west part of the trench to reach the same level as the east part.

We found three irregular small rocks around the pot.   In the middle of the trench, the L27 wall keeps going under the L24 area. And we found very big pit(L32) under the L24.

A plaster surface was found to the NW of the pit L.5210. Its locus is L.5218. It has white plaster with deep cracks formed over time that makes it uneven. This surface preserved only about 1m2 area in a circular shape. As it was assumed for L.5216, this one may have been used for a very short time activity also. Since it is an artifact free feature, it is hard to extrapolate about the type of activity that possibly took place here. At the end of the day, this feature removed and its locus is closed.      There is a skull in L.5217 near the S section but it is not clear yet if it is associated with a skeleton or belong to a human. These questions will be answered in a few days.

The first piece of obsidian (a fragment from a blade) at this trench was recovered at the 573.50 meters mark. Materials on the western side of the wall were collected separately as Locus # 4. As the wall was being cleaned, a change became evident on the northwest quadrant which displayed a good quantity of smaller stone and very soft soil. Cleaning the area also showed us that the wall came to an end approximately 2.5 meters from the southwest baulk. All materials from this area (L 5) were collected as a pit and controlled separately from the wall to the south. Since we had not been collecting anything earlier it is very likely that no materials from this fill were collected under any other loci collections.

A corner is also visible in the southwestern baulk, and the pottery may lie within a room created by mudbrick wall L43. Beneath the floor surface was a thick subsurface (L61) of medium sized pebbles.

We took the elevations to get a better idea _ÑÐ the layer in F1 measured 267.93 while that in F9 in L9035 measured 568.37. This 40cm difference may just be due to the 10m or so between F9 and F1. There were two ash layers in the wall of L9035 which made it appear to us that it could actually be some type of mortar between the bricks.

While proceeding with this work it began to appear as if this wall was built on top of another or of a floor where fragments of mortar stones began appearing from either used in wall construction or discarded on a surface. I decided as this time to change the locus number and collect separately. Some of the pottery from within Locus 8 or from Locus 9 appears to be Early Bronze.    Following breakfast we were delighted to receive 3 distinct rain showers with the second one packing a good punch of rain, thunder, and lightning. Temperatures cooled down but the high winds began to rip the tents and they had to be taken down. We continued on two projects, one to level the wall down to what appeared to be either a new wall or foundation, and taking the rest of the trench (now on the same locus) deeper still.   So far this trench has not yielded much and we could be abandoning it in the next few days.

The other is mostly in the NE quadrant of the trench w/ orange color bricky soil.

We are continuing to bring down loci 59, the loci in the western half of the trench. In the western baulk I can see an ashy layer and a larger mud brick layer, possibly slump. We never found these layers in the fill loci, we must have missed them when we went through the area with picks or they were so broken up that we could not have seen them. The ubaid house was 1m 40cm below a ceramic and cobble surface which is visible in both my trench D8 and D5 which is next door and which had the ubaid house. Currently the highest locus is 68cm below that surface. The pit goes down even further, another 60cm. This means that the bottom of the pit should be on top of the ubaid layer. One troubling point about this is that there is nothing visible in the inside of the pit, no mud bricks, and no surfaces. This may mean that there is nothing for the nest 60cm.   Because the trench is getting fairly deep I decided to stop and straighten the baulks. Lokeman did this while the other guys scraped and brushed flat the lower surface of L59. As the North West area was being scraped we came across a wall and what appears to be a floor. When we further scraped I was able to positively ID the floor as touching the edge of the pit. The east side of the trench was almost 10cm higher because we had not brought down that part of L56. This allowed me to have 2 guys follow the floor, starting at L59 and moving eastwards towards the baulk. When they did this the found another floor surface which is cracked and broken and at a steep angle into the eastern baulk which is only 20cm above topsoil. There appears to be some burnt mud brick next to it. When Lynn came by the trench she pointed out how there were multiple burnt marks in contemporaneous surfaces in this trench.

After we had found L65 we found L74, a small grouping of three bricks against the west baulk. It looks like one of these bricks lines up with wall L65. There is a gap almost a meter wide between the edge of where we have L65 and the bricks. Pits blow out most of this area, which is one possible explanation. One of the bricks is oriented east west instead if north south like the bricks in wall L65 and the other brick next to it. One possible reason for this is that the wall is turning from running north to south to turning at a nearly 90 degree angle to the west into the baulk. The bricks that are visible in the baulk validate this theory.   Through a blessed act of god one day right after I had finished scraping and cleaning the trench is started raining. The tent was down and so the trench got a complete dosing. This was amazing because as soon as it stopped we were able to see lines of walls that we had not seen before and what was there was much clearer. I got into the trench barefoot and places nails in the corners of the walls that Bekir and Lynn could identify when standing on the baulk. Later Bekir came back and helped me try and work out which walls went with each other. We were able to positively connect the few free standing bricks (L.74) against he baulk with wall L56 because we can see the lines of one of the courses of bricks. It appears that wall L65 is not a four-course wall but possibly a wall with a building butting up against it. There is an almost complete square building with its west wall abutting L65. The northern wall of this building is blown out by pit L58. The brick area in the southern section now appears to be a building also. We are able to see three walls. Both the side walls (which run north south) disappear into the baulks and the southern wall is not visible in the trench at all.    One day of this week was spent simply straightening the baulks and evening up the lopsided eastern baulk of my trench. To do this Bekir and me completely restrung the eastern baulk and re cut it. This actually lengthened the width of the trench in the southern section by about 25cm.              ,~: D-8-2005-05-028-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8,"1156,2005-05-28," D-8-2005-05-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 56,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   May 28, 2005      This morning began by sweeping the North West corner of the trench with a large whisk broom and then spraying the area down with water. When we did this we could clearly see four courses of bricks (Wall L65). Bradley believes that this is the large wall which runs around the tepe. They saw this wall in the step trench and again in several other trenches including E2 which is close to my trench. To the east of L65 is an area which seems to be a multi layered floor (L66). Using a trowel Bekir was able to pop small section off and then in the flake we could see up to 5 layers. Whether the floor and the wall connect is still unclear. In the area to the east of that we thought that we saw several other walls but when we brought the area down 5cm we could no longer see it.   Wall L65 is cut as it goes into the western baulk by an ash pit. This pit, L60, when excavated contained only two pieces of pottery and no bone or lithic material. IN addition the pit shows up at a downward angle in the baulk. This makes me believe that this was not a garbage pit but a pit full or material which burned and then slumped. The area to the south and east of L60 appeared to be on its own loci of fill, distinct from the surrounding fill. It was full of sherds and small well rounded stones. I excavated this area as its own locus (L61). Once we reached a point where the part of large fill loci L56 was on level with the floor L66 where the two loci abut one another I decided to change the loci (New Loci L62) because L56 continued the entire length of the trench as so would not provide any good context for the floor.    L63 is another ashy pit just to the south of L60. It at first appeared to be related to the pit above it, L30, but when it was completely excavated we could see in the baulk that there had been a definite layer of non ashy fill between them though the dimensions are still the same. Against the east baulk sharply angled downwards towards the east is a small cracked surface area, L67. This area has some burnt mud brick next to it and appears to have been burn itself at some point.      ,~: D-8-2005-05-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 56,"1157,2005-05-28," D-5-2005-05-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5208,","   Kenantepe 2005Page 1   Datum: 587.95 (located to the NW of D.5)   Trench: D.5   Date: May 28, 2005         Work in L.5220 went on with big pick.

Ashy soil in the middle of the trench is probably coming from the W side of N section and continuing diagonally all the way down to the E side of the S section. It is hard to see the edge of this soil but it is separating the L.39 in the E side of the trench from the L. 38, which remains in the rest of the trench.

Henecke      I began the morning by straightening and cleaning the entire trench. I then closed out the largest two loci (L65 and 58), leaving the ashy pit L63, the sounding level L45 and the floor/subfloor L66/68. After cleaning the trench, we saw the outline of the top of a mudbrick wall in the southern corner. It appears to have two rows of reddish brown bricks with a single gray colored brick in the middle (L72). On either side of this wall (about .7 m thick), I created new loci. L73 is the sliver on the southern side, while L71 is the longer northern section. There seems to be little difference in these two fill loci besides physical separation. L71 is vaguely L shaped and may be further divided as we excavate. The soil in the eastern half _ÑÐ the square section beneath L45 _ÑÐ seems particularly different. It is softer and seems to have a more mixed content.       Yesterday a few large stones began to emerge just south of where the L53 stone wall had been. Today, the stones extended further and may form another wall. We uncovered a door post stone but there are few associated stones. North of this stone wall (L70) is an area of grayish soil (L69). It is not yet clear what produced this difference. Within this locus, ash pit L63 continues although it is difficult to tell how deep it extends.

Painter      Today began with a full sweep of the entire trench as the rain last night washed in outside dirt and debris. The primary concentration for excavation today was better defining the various walls and floor/surface loci that are currently open. As I was short two workmen today, things tended to move more slowly.      The remaining 15 cm left unexcavated in fill 7151 were removed and the section profiles cleaned. It appears that I am moving into darker fill in this area and no surfaces or other features are present. Thus 7151 will be closed and a new locus opened to account for this change in soil color.      The articulation of pebble surface 7166 continued in a northern and western direction, however it appears that this surface does not continue in this direction or was not preserved. Therefore it can be stated that this surface is not connected with the south face of wall 7160. What was found instead was a hardened filly layer (7156) overlaying a softer, ashy deposit. Fill 7156 has still to be explored and removed in the southwest, southeast and northeast corners of the locus at which time the full extend of surface 7166 will be evaluated and can then be excavated.           ,~: F-7-2005-05-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7139,"1161,2005-05-28," G-9-2005-05-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9,","   Daily Trench    Area G   Trench 9   May 28, 2005      Today we are continuing down in loci 14 (North) and 15 (South). So far not much different than the arbitrary loci that were above. There was, however, some bricky material coming up just south of the step in locus 15. I am starting with a thorough trench cleaning with brushes. Then I will take overview photos and then scrape around to see where to start. I will probably have them start with L14 taking it down approximately 5cm while I scrape in L15.      Locus 14 continued with bricky patches and soft dark earth. We will take it down another level. All together today, Locus 14 was taken down approximately 50cm. Yikes! There are no longer any bricky patches and the color is no longer dark. It is rather homogenous loose sand. Since the locus was brought down so far, I will probably change the locus number to another arbitrary subsoil locus.      Tomorrow I will focus attention on Locus 15 to begin bringing it down to the same level.      Erdol was just walking by with his huge putty knife wanting to excavate in someone_Ñés trench.

Henecke      I reassigned loci yesterday, and after cleaning, we once again examined the situation. I divided what was the eastern square of L71 into a northwestern half (L75) and a southeastern half (L77). This division was made to avoid contamination based on the assumption that L77 still rests within the topsoil zone. Although the mudbricks of L72 extend in situ into this area, and this suggests that the context is good. The rest of L71, to the northwest of wall L72 became L76.      A pit (L74) now appears in the eastern corner of L77, which we excavated entirely today. It was approximately 40 cm deep and contained a mixture of bones, pottery and lithics with interspersed ashy inclusions. To the direct left of this was the remains of an animal jaw, and at the bottom were a few small stones.       The southeastern wall of L45 showed the possibility of a burnt surface a few cm below the current elevation of L75. We removed the surprasurface soil and found a square surface with the remains of one mudbrick at this point it is difficult to tell whether this is a wall or a floor. It ends before reaching L74 and is blownout in the southwestern half of L75.       After cleaning off about 5 cm of soil we uncovered a pebbled surface across L76. There appear to be Chalco sherds impressed into this surface. It is possible that wall L70, 72 and the surface under L76 are a street.       At the end of the day, we cleared off L70, which seems to extend deeper into the ground. We also leveled of L69, which has a distinct ashy gray soil. It is still unclear whether this soil covers the entire locus or what caused the difference with the light brown soil in the southeastern half of the trench (L76, 75, 77).

Baldi      On May 26th 2005 after discussing the East baulk of trench F 4, some questions had surfaced having to do with the brick wall collapse and the ash layer evident in the above mentioned baulk section. A secondary question dealt with the extend of the area of habitation or use on this part of the tepe, while another was a an inquiry into the cobble surfaces evident in the South baulk of trench F 1. It has been a couple of years since either of these two trenches have been excavated and their condition has deteriorated somewhat. In addition to exploring the questions posed above, we wanted to see the relationships between all of these trenches. Following these discussions we asked Cengiz to gather a few good workers to remove top soil and overburden layers from a large area East of F 4.    When we returned to work on May 28th about 70 centimeters were removed from an area about 6 by 6 meters. For control I laid a 4 by 3 meter trench within that space, and while about 10 centimeters were left between this trench and F 4, as we excavate F 19 those 10 centimeters will be removed.    Our aims for the week were to reach the cobble surface which was labeled as Locus # 2, its one course of stone was photographed, and removed with hand picks. Some materials from this surface were collected as were those from below it as Locus # 3, a soil sample was also taken. On the 29th we unearthed a skull and a few other human bones near the southwest corner and these were collected as Locus # 4 KT # 1, additional bones found the following day were also collected as the same KT #. The area of the burial pit was dug out and sifted. I believe it cut through Locus # 2 but I am unsure of this. Additionally we have what appear to be bricks, a wall, and an area with some burned oven remains beginning to articulate and will continue to work on this over the folowing week. Work on the trench moved slowly over the last couple of days due to the opening of other nearby trenches and  conditions which included heavy rains.      ,~: F-19-2005-05-29-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19,"1167,2005-05-29," G-9-2005-05-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9/Locus 14,","   Daily Trench    Area G   Trench 9   May 29, 2005      Today I am working on the southern half of the trench (L15) to bring it down to the same level as the northern half (L14). There had been some bricky patches in the southeastern side of L15 by the step. There had also been some large cobbles.      Well, I also decided to take down the northern half of the step to make it easier to get out as we get deeper. In the process we came across a burial (L17). It is poorly preserved and the worse for wear due to being discovered by a pick. It is just below the surface. The head faces to the south with the body some how tightly flexed. There might also be a hand in front of the face. The body was too poorly preserved to note anything else.      While dealing with the burial I wasn_Ñét watching what was going on and let a worker plow through a pebble surface, or at least part of one. The surface is now L16. The surface appears to be deep as it still continues after the pick episode. There are also possible bricky patches that may be walls coming up. Ramazan was brought in to help and I assigned Tekdar as his apprentice.      We also took down some of L14 (about 10 cm) and still there is nothing. Rats!

Baldi      Having removed the cobble surface, we collected one bag of subsoil sample (L # 3 KT # 2) and changed locus number to keep the separation of those items recovered below the surface. We then continued excavating through a much lighter fill which appears to be about 20 to 25 centimeters thick. Following this level we will get to the red soil and the brick. As we were doing this a human burial became apparent near the southwest corner and was clearly announced by the well defined shape of the human skull. This find was designated as Locus # 4. The skull does not appear to be in the best of shapes and has a well pronounced hole on the upper cranial bones. We will clean it up well but quickly, and photograph it as we articulate it. The rest of the skeleton is also not very well preserved or intact, rather we found pieces scatter around it. We collected in addition to a partial skull a few finger bones, some teeth, and several small fragments (L # 4 KT # 1). The burial pit contents were sifted through fine (2 mm) mesh and collected. It is clear that not all parts will be found, at least not at this time. Our efforts for the rest of the day were concentrated on lowering the trench to the red brick below.

Bradley and I investiated the floor L66 and decided that there was not enoguh to take a HAP sample.

The mudbrick appeared to be burnt.   Besides wall L65 there are now no other active feature loci in the the trench. We took down L64, the southern most 4 meters, 15 cm.      ,~: D-8-2005-05-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 61,"1173,2005-05-29," G-7-2005-05-29 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 7/Locus 16,","   Daily    Area G, Trench 7   May 29, 2005   Baris UZEL          We started to dig L40 and L37_Ñés North sides to do same level with other parts.

Henecke      It seems very likely now that the group of the L70 stone wall, L72 mudbrick wall and L78 pebbled surface are a street context, and as a result, we had to stop work until we could take an aerial photograph of the architecture. After breakfast we took the photographs, but upon review, they did not come out well enough for our purposes. We will have to retake them tomorrow, and I am unable to do any work in the western half of the trench until they have been taken.       We found a small mudbrick wall, which lies on a slightly different angle to the L70 wall, between L75 and 77. After the rain several courses of mudbrick became evident, and this wall seems to extend beneath the L78 surface.       To the north of the mudbrick wall L79 there is an area of gray soil with a distinct color and texture (L80), which we uncovered yesterday. It had appeared in the baulk of L45 as a black line, which we originally thought signaled a surface. At this point, it is very difficult to determine how to classify this locus. Once we removed the soil from above this black line, apart from a few flat lying pottery sherds, it did not appear to be a floor. L80 contains a mixture of bones, lithics and pottery, and it is harder than the surrounding soil. It is possible that this locus is a pit or fill bounded by a pit to the west (L75). To the southwest of L80 is an area of loose fill (L75), which may also be a pit, although it is cut off by L79 as if it were regular fill. Between L75 and 80 and within L80 are a few mudbricks, which are most likely mudbrick slump from L79.       We also continued to excavate in L77, which is mostly fill and possibly contaminated by erosion.       L69 continues to be a grayish fill clearly distinct from L78, but without any distinctive features.       We also cleared off stone wall L70, and after I remove L78, I will excavate on both sides to determine how deep it reaches.      ,~: E-2-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,"1175,2005-05-30," D-9-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9/Locus 39,","   Kenantepe 2005Page 1   Datum: 587.95   Trench: D.9   Date: May 30, 2005         We excavated the entire trench w/ small pick and after cleaned it carefully with a trowel and small brush. This work showed that the pinkish area in the NW portion of the trench is still there but it is shrunk a little but getting longer towards S corner of the trench. The ash soil area is in the NW, middle and SE corner of the trench. It possible that it consists of not too wide line but we dispersed the soft ashy soil into larger space while sweeping. This should be checked with more careful sweeping and study of the sections.      In the mid-west part of the trench there is a circular line visible in the early morning.

Ramazon is still here to help. I had problems with elevations earlier, the transit was too high, but we lowered it and hopefully things will be easier to do now.      Bradley suggested that we take a HAP sample from L16. Unfortunately an unknown percentage of the whole surface was removed yesterday by a workman. The sample collected will never be 100% but it will be the best we can do. The sample contains pottery from the surface. The opening elevation is 2.98 (with IH at .83 and datum 579.75) and therefore is at 577.42. The HAP sample removed equals 27 liters. Further liter volume of the locus removed today (there will be more tomorrow) equals 12 buckets at 9 liters each equaling 108 liters. All of the buckets were screened and some interesting sherds were found including one with incised design in a floral pattern as well as one that appeared to be mold pressed with raised domed bumps all over the exterior.      Locus 18 is the hard, bricky corner abutting L16 and moving into the southwest corner of the trench.      Locus 14 is still going down. We removed approximately 20cm today and still there is nothing special, but the fill is obviously cultural with pottery and other remains. The dirt continues to be patchy with some hard and compact and others being loose and soft. There is no special color to the dirt at this time.     ,~: G-9-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9/Locus 14,"1177,2005-05-30," D-5-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5210,","   Kenantepe 2005Page 1   Datum: 587.95 (located to the NW of D.5)   Trench: D.5   Date: May 30, 2005         We excavated in L.5220 w/ big pick today.

In 2001, F6 was dug as a test trench. A few days ago, Bradley had the workmen expand the old trench to the east, north, and west. (The trench is at the southern edge of the tell and couldn_Ñét be expanded in that direction without going down.) The trench now measures roughly 5 x 5 meters. After the workmen finished, a pebble floor was clearly visible towards the bottom of the east baulk.    Bradley and I decided to initially divide the trench into four loci. These numbers are the next in the sequence used by the original trench. Locus 6024 was assigned to the matrix east of the original test trench, locus 6026 to the west, and 6027 to the north. Locus 6025 was assigned to the material that had slumped into the old trench. For this reason, no artifacts were saved from this locus.    We excavated most of 6025 today. We wanted to excavate down to virgin soil. Some sherds are still being found in the southern most part of the trench which was the deepest part of the sounding. Towards the end of the day, I started excavating 6027 in the northeast corner of that locus. I found what appears to be the stub of a rock wall with a surface associated to the east. The surface is ashy and can be traced in the unexcavated baulk section above 6024.      ,~: F-6-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 6/Locus 6024,"1179,2005-05-30," F-20-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 20/Locus 1,","   Daily Trench    Area F, Trench 20   May 30, 2005   M. Baldi      This trench was opened just west of F 4 and the same inquiries posted for F 19 apply to this trench and I will import some of it into this  entry with a few changes:      ! The concerns and questions we desire to answer by opening this trench have much to do with the thick layer of burnt material that can best be observed on the West and East baulks of F 4. This ash layer is especially pronounced on the West baulk of F 4 and one of our questions deals with how far west it extends. Of course there are several layers of interest that need to be documented for better context and to complement that which was found and collected as F 4 was excavated.   The trench was \haphazardly\ laid as a 5.5 meter long by 4.75 meter wide of excavation area; baulks are not counted as part of the trench. The two trenches (F 4 and F 20) are adjoining and we have no separation between them; we will remove the area between the two trenches joining them together as we go. Having the baulks of F 4 to work from is very helpful and will allow us to speed things up. After the trench was marked at the end of May 29th we had asked some of the workers to return that afternoon but they were unable to, so we began clearing the area today and started work with big picks in hopes to get past the cobble surface already documented in F 19. We have been interested on the extent of the lower town at Kenan Tepe and its relationship to the main mound perhaps as an outlaying commercial or production area. We also have questions about the possible causes for the thick burnt ashy layer and its extent on this side of the lower area. Was this a production plant that burned down, or was it perhaps a single burned house. Of interest also is finding the reasons for the apparently extensive conflagration; was it an accident? or was it intentionally burned down by an invading group. Being this close to the river, this area would have been one of the first areas to suffer invasion and destruction.                     ,~: F-20-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 20/Locus 1,"1180,2005-05-30," D-8-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 62,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   May 30, 2005         This morning we began by bringing down L62. With this finished the entire trench was at the same level except for L65, L66 and pit L58 which is still present. I began to articulate wall L65 after we removed the fill which was under floor L66, we had left a 5cm barrier of fill against the edge of wall L65. The wall was very hard to articulate because there is almost no difference in the soil. I am able to do it by pushing a trowel horizontally into the fill which we left next to the wall and popping it. The soil will break at the brick line as the non-wall fill pops away.    After breakfast we brought down L64 10cm with a large pick. As we were doing this we were able to see the edges of a pit. The area where the pit, L68, was had had ash coming up through the soil before. L68 is .9 by .86m and roughly circular. It had a clear bottom of packed soil which was cracked and pitted and seemed almost brick like. There was no bone but quite a few pieces of pottery. When Bradley and Bekir looked at the pottery from this pit and from the surrounding loci there were quite a few ubaid sherds. As we were taking down L64, which the pit is within, and we took out the pit several bricks came up at the edge of the pit. I took one as a soil sample for the pit locus 68 but I could go with the surrounding fill locus L64.      ,~: D-8-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 62,"1181,2005-05-30," G-7-2005-05-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 7/Locus 16,","   Daily    Area G, Trench 7   May 30, 2005   Baris UZEL          Today, we continued to dig L45 (SE corner of the trench) pit area.

The top of this surface shows great similarity with the floor surface of L 7. The elevations (L 7: NW 573.31 and SE 573.13 versus L 10: C 573.13) allow us to suggest that both surfaces are associated. In L 7 today was found a spin whirl (KT#) and a few obsidian flacks (KT#10).

The locus still continues down. It seems to work in waves, extending up against L15 the bricky locus in the southwestern corner of the trench. These different waves could be different levels of the surface, but there are no other indicators of breaks within the pebble fill.       L14 took a great deal of time to try to get flat today.

In some areas it looks like there might be bricks but it is not really clear so it had to be cleaned. When it had been cleaned one it was still not really clear so I had one workman go over it with a trowel. When this was done there were clear brick lines. These brick lines appear to cover the entire southern third of the trench. Tomorrow we need to sweep again and look more critically at what is going on before I assign loci.    In addition to the discovery of the new bricks we brought down L62 in the northern section of the trench down to the level of L64. There was very little pottery in these 10 cm of fill.    There is a small grouping of three bricks against the west baulk. It looks like one of these bricks lines up with wall L65. There is a gap almost a meter wide between the edge of where we have L65 and the bricks. Pits blow out most of this area, which is one possible explanation. One of the bricks is oriented east west instead if north south like the bricks in wall L65 and the other brick next to it. One possible reason for this is that the wall is turning from running north to south to turning at a nearly 90 degree angle to the west into the baulk. The bricks that are visible in the baulk validate this theory.

For this reason, I reassigned locus 6027 to the material I_Ñéd already excavated. The surface is now locus 6028 and the stones, 6029. The remainder of what originally was 6027 I reassigned to locus 6030. I began by taking top elevations and then articulated the rocks in 6029 to see if it was really a wall. The rocks ranged in size between 4-6 cm but were only a single layer. After I removed them, it was apparent that they were lying on top of 6028. The surface does not extend west beyond the stones. Bekir suggested that surface 6028 might be part of the pebble floor found in the eastern baulk. With additional help since the stadia rod had to be held in mid air, we took the elevation of the pebble surface in the eastern baulk in two places. The southern end had an elevation of 569.43 meters and the northern end had an elevation of 560.47 meters. The top of locus 6028 has an elevation of 569.43 meters so we concluded it is all part of the same surface.    The workmen completed the excavation of 6025.

This is already about 10 cm below so called kiln, which means long term of use of one and same type of pot stands. L 10 turned out to be not very smooth surface.

The trench is E of F7 and N of F8. It is a 4.25 by 4.25 trench that was last excavated in 2001. Several days ago the protective plastic was cleared and the baulks cleaned back. Because several days have passed since, I decided to have the guys clear about 5 cm of soil from across the trench to make sure that only good context is available in the next pass. This clearing locus is L2024. After that it might be possible to locate some of the many loci left at the end of 2001.      As they are digging I_Ñém noticing some of the different loci from 2001. The rocky area in the NE (L2018), the cracky soil of L2017. It_Ñés too messy right now to trace the wall (L2019). The rocky area was not very thick so it was removed with L2024. The rests of the loci couldn_Ñét be identified or defined. After cleaning and sweeping, little was visible except a darker ashy area in the S. This was somewhat artibitrarily defined as L2026, and the N part L2025.      As L2025 is being removed, the ashy area is spreading northwards.      After a quick sweep we noted a few things including a defined brick along the W baulk near the SW corner and patches of poorly defined bricky material in the N half of the trench.      A huge rainstorm stopped work, after which I had the guys small pick again across the entire area of L2025 to swee if we could clear things up. New KT bags were started because of the rain, but they also match the two passes taken in L2025.      Some well-defined mudbricks are appearing in the NW corner but their form is yet unclear. Elsewhere particles of brick are interspersed with ash and loose soil.        ,~: F-2-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2024,"1195,2005-06-01," F-7-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7139,","   Daily Trench    Area F, Trench 7   June 1, 2005   C. Painter      Today began by excavating the rest of surface 7166 located in the southeast corner of the trench. The Household Archaeology Protocol (HAP) was used with the HAP sample already taken on May 29, 2005. The ratio of sieving was at 100% on a _ inch screen. Apart from pottery, bone, and lithic KT_Ñés, a soil sample for floatation was also collected (KT5). This was a very thin surface (&lt;5cm), but wide, with a total measurement of sixty liters being collected.      Subsurface fill 7172 was also opened below 7159. This pinkish gray (7.5 YR 7/2) medium to coarse tightly packed clay yielded little in the way of artifacts. Fill 7157 was also simultaneously excavated completely. In this fill, only a rounded pebble scatter served as a feature of interest. It was initially thought to be an additional surface but upon further articulation it was found not to be the case.      Fill 7155 was also excavated with small hand picks for 10 cm bringing the entire locus level with 7139. At this point it was decided to close both L7139 and L7155 and open the entire area as a single locus since no features are present at this time and the soil compositions and colors are relatively similar. This new locus is 7173, a brown (10 YR 5/3) medium to fine textured silty clay with &lt;1 cm rounded clumps and a medium level of sorting.       Lastly the rest of pit L7162 was excavated which included the smaller \pit\ or subdivision within the larger pit. This smaller pit did not include much in the way of pottery or bone and was relatively shallow (&lt; 50 cm). A closing elevation was taken in this central area of the pit and L7162 was closed.     ,~: F-7-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7139,"1196,2005-06-01," D-8-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 62,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   June 1, 2005   E.o.      Today our main concern was to figure out what was going on with the brick area in the southern section. To so this we scraped it for the second time, paying special attention to areas where any identification was problematic. Almost the entire day was taken up with scraping sections of the trench flat. When Bekir came by he also pointed out that there were sections of the baulk that were not straight and that it could be very problematic to draw the baulk, plus it was just sloppy archaeology. To remedy this we discussed several areas, which I could have the guys work on if I were waiting for him to come up and help me.   Through a blessed act of god right after I had finished scraping and cleaning the trench is started raining. The tent was down and so the trench got a complete dosing. This was amazing because as soon as it stopped we were able to see lines of walls that we had not seen before and what was there was much more clear. I got into the trench barefoot and places nails in the corners of the walls that Bekir and Lynn could identify when standing on the baulk. Later Bekir came back and helped me try and work out which walls went with each other. We were able to positively connect the few free standing bricks against he baulk with wall L56 because we can see the lines of one of the courses of bricks. It appears that wall L65 is not a four-course wall but possibly a wall with a building butting up against it. There is an almost complete square building with its west wall abutting L65. The northern wall of this building is blown out by pit L58. The brick area in the southern section now appears to be a building also. We are able to see three walls. Both the side walls (which run north south) disappear into the baulks and the southern wall is not visible in the trench at all.      ,~: D-8-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 62,"1197,2005-06-01," E-2-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   June 1st, 2005   J. Henecke      We continue to find many small features, which have not yet joined together to create a whole picture.       In the northern section of the trench, above L45, I sampled floor L81 and removed it entirely. I also cleared soil from L69, and we redivided the locus into L84 and 87. Either of these loci may be wall features, and they are divided by a clear line in the soil. L87 rests in the corner of the baulk and is a reddish color, while L84 is a gray tone similar to L69. L86 continues to be dominated by mixed fill with ashy inclusions, and is distinct from L84 because the soil is much looser.      After successfully taking the aerial photographs in the morning, I began to remove L78, sifting all soil. The floor is large, and the work will extend into the next day.       I finished clearing L80, and created L85 when flat lying pot sherds, lithics and bone began to appear. The sherds are too scattered classify the locus as a floor.       I had initially thought that L77 was entirely mixed and contaminated fill, but today, we began to find pseudomorphic organic remains against wall L79, and two stone artifacts (KT 4 and 5), which seemed to be resting next to each other in an upright position. I attribute the pseudomorphs to mudbrick slump from wall L79.       Tomorrow, I hope to make more progress in removing some of the small elements to determine how they are related.     ,~: E-2-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,"1198,2005-06-01," G-7-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 7/Locus 16,","   Daily    Area G, Trench 7   June 1, 2005   Baris UZEL          Today, we started to clean area L 49 with trowel in order to understand the area.

First of all, we got some cultural matterial in the locus, but we didn_Ñét get any sherd or cultural matterial after some level. I believe, we almost got all of the virgin soil area in the trench. But I wanna be sure about that tomorrow.    Then I excavated L53 pithos burial. But all of the bones in the pithos weren_Ñét very good condition. I got some head bones in the pithos. I think, the pithos has more than one head or burial. I tried to clean the bones and I took some pictures during excavating the burial. And I finished to excavated the pithos.

Baldi      As worked ended yesterday and I took my elevations I noticed quite a bit of unevenness between the East and West halves of the trench. Desiring to remedy this I placed the workers on the job of leveling it throughout. As we started this we began to see yet more cobblestones near the northeast corner and also adjacent to the south baulk. Going against my previous plan I decide to slow the work down and concentrate on detailing these cobbles to better connect them to the earlier cobblestone surface if attached to it, or documented as a new surface. More cobbles appeared and work turned to slow trowel work, additionally a pit appeared near the northeast wall which I labeled Locus # 4 and began a methodical collection of material, but decided not to collect soil samples this time. It is noteworthy to mention that the cobbles appearing also appear to be composed of two courses and my initial estimation is that they are part of the earlier cobbles already removed. There is also a collection of larger rocks near the southwest corner which need some work, at this point I am quite unsure as to their purpose or association to the other features.                    ,~: F-20-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 20/Locus 2,"1200,2005-06-01," F-22-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 22/Locus 1,","   Daily Trench    Area F, Trench 22   June 1, 2005   M. Baldi      We took the trench down to about 60 centimeters below top level. As mentioned we are not collecting as yet but we have located the cobblestone surface and have begun detail work on the cobbles. We want to get the trench to about the same level as that of F 20 and I think that by the end of the day we were fairly close to that!. I will have to check the elevations taken today to see where we are. It seemed from the earlier excavation of    F 1 and F 4 that the surface continues through this trench and that it takes a pronounced dip by the time it comes out on F 4, additionally, on F 4 the surface appears composed of several courses of stone laid on top of each other. One of the things I am wondering now is the reason for this elevation and thickness differences, Bradley hypothesize that erosion would have brought the stone down to rest there, I on the other hand believe that this being the end of the tepe would have had additional reinforcement at the end as if to signify the end of the road, perhaps as a safety wall for small children, or as part of a defensive wall. We could also be looking at two different surfaces at this point and excavating slower will yield the answers to these inquiries.            ,~: F-22-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 22/Locus 1,"1201,2005-06-01," G-10-2005-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 10/Locus 7,","   Daily Trench    Area: G   Trench: 10   June 1, 2005    Diana Backus      Today we removed everything left from L 7 and we closed this locus. Also we cleaned completely L 10 and L 11, which means that we removed all visible fragments of the cobbled floor surface. After that it was really difficult to take decision hoe to proceed. Finally we decided to track out the difference in the soil texture, which was noticed before. That is why we divided the trench in three parts and they became our new loci.

Our goal was to reach virgin soil. We wanted to know if there was any cultural material below the pebble floor in the east baulk. Virgin soil was reached relatively quickly in both loci.    I subdivided 6030 into four separate loci for the following reasons. In the north profile of 6025, we saw what looked like a pit profile. Most likely it was the filled in after the original north edge of the test trench caved in. This matrix was definitely softer than the surrounding loci. 6031 is an extension of 6026 and the east-west line dividing them, I feel is arbitrary. 6032 on the other hand was defined because it is a layer of stones with visible horizontal potsherds. Locus 6033 is the remnant. Again, the east-west division between 6033 and 6030 is somewhat arbitrary.    We swept 6032 with a stiff broom and concluded it was a good enough surface and just barely big enough to do a HAP sample. We took a 100% sample of the floor in the 50 cm by 50 cm area. The small triangular area to the east only yielded one additional shard. We did not have enough material left over to do a soil sample.    Note on stratigraphy: The very center of the trench along the north baulk is problematic. In the redesignation of loci, it got \left behind\. 6028 definitely did not extend any further west than shown on the plan. 6032 was shaped as shown on the day plan of June 4.

Thus, trench D.10 is set as 5x3.5m size and the excavations started at the end of the working hours on June 4th.      In June 5th, in the late afternoon, we continued removing the surface soil, which is locus 1.      Today, (June 06), we excavated until the depth of 587.72m. In the N half of the trench, soil color and texture began to change into harder, pinkish with crumbly texture. Because of this, work will begin with a new locus number with the goal to reach to the same Ubaid architecture level as in trench D.8.      In the S half of the trench, there are two large pits (L.4 and L.5). Pit L.4 covers the entire mid-west portion of the trench and it does not have a regular round shape for a pit. Pit L.5 is in the SW corner that occupies about 1m2 space. Both of these pits go into the W section. I will excavate both of them to clean and reach their bottom.      The eastern edge of the trench is much lower than the Ubaid architecture found in trench D.8 because of the natural slope of the mound here. This area has also has been used as the wheelbarrow path this year to remove the dirt from D.8. Thus, this lowermost area of the trench will be touched later in the coming days, but probably, there may not be any distinct cultural deposit preserved.                                                           ,~: D-10-2005-06-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 10/Locus 1,"1213,2005-06-04," G-9-2005-06-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9/Locus 16,","   Daily Trench    Area G   Trench 9   June 4, 2005      While we were gone in Diyarbakir someone got into the trench and dug around where the vessel and beads had been. I photographed the disturbance and they spoke to Arif about it.      Locus 20 has been the arbitrarily chosen northern locus for removal of cultural fill. A pit (Locus 21) became visible oriented northwest/southeast near the western baulk. We took it down approximately 10cm. With discussion with Bradley decided to take all locus 20 down including area with remains of pit since still no good loci are appearing. After taking L20 down farther it appears that there might be more pebbly surface coming up in the western middle area. Will investigate this more tomorrow.      Locus 15 is still working towards the east with the in situ pot smash along the eastern baulk. Savash is taking this area down.      In locus 16 we are removing the last vestiges of the pebble surface(s). We were not able to establish the parameters of this locus.      With locus 18 we took it down to the level of the base of locus 16. It had been very hard and compact soil with some bricky coloring and patchiness. At the level of locus 16 there was a color change to a much more yellowish tone as well as becoming significantly more loose and soft.

Additionally, its line in the W was also visible too. We carefully excavated the inside of it by leaving the edge (perhaps 0.5 cm line) as much as untouched. However, our test excavations today showed that the soil is not different from the immediate outside of it, leaving us with a question mark about the nature of this feature.

Today we began by cleaning all the walls. It was Bradley_Ñés first day back on the Tepe since he want to a conference and so I wanted him to be able to see all the walls and then make a decision about what he wanted dug next. It was decided that the first order of business would be to bring down the areas that we were uncertain of. To do this I opened locus 78 which is a T shaped locus which encompasses some area against the eastern baulk and a section of the middle of the trench up to the brick feature L74. We brought this area down 5cm and though we didn_Ñét see any other walls we started to see several other things including a small area of rocks. I decided that the next best course of action was to bring down the area inside walls L75, 76,and 77. This inside surface abuts the southern baulk and is locus 79.    Locus 79 was brought down almost 15cm. So far we have not found a surface and very little pottery. Towards the end we found several bricks in the center of this area, up against the baulk.

Baldi      After a light sweeping of the trench and in the early morning light the top bricks of the collapsed wall began appearing. Our belief is that a wall collapsed south to north from the area of F 4 and we are beginning to very clearly see these bricks. Some of them are made out of a light clayish material that was collected in all probability higher up the mound, where most of the bricks found appear to be made of this material; while others are made out of a reddish loam material likely mined from an area closer to the river. There is also between some of them a light band of mortar which in some instances is quite thick. The locus number for these brick as one entity is 6, a convention likely to remain for some time as we continue to excavate. After photographing and obtaining elevations the excavation was continued and we began removing the brick. Our idea is to come down about 25 centimeters before looking at it again and then proceed to the next row of bricks. On Bradley_Ñés suggestion the trench was extended to meet the north baulk of F 4, which by the way is not in very good shape. The new dimensions of the trench are: 5.80 meters north to south, and 3 meters east to west.           ,~: F-19-2005-06-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19/Locus 4,"1217,2005-06-04," G-10-2005-06-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 10/Locus 12,","   Daily Trench    Area: G   Trench: 10   June 4, 2005    Diana Backus      We were unable to dig in G 10 on June 2, 2005.

The ceramic material shows up that we still are going through EB layer. At the same time the ceramics are much less than couple of days ago, although we found almost fully saved very coarse big bowl at the very north balk of the trench. My hopes that we could reach a floor surface in L 12 were unsuccessful. Although there is visible difference in the soil texture in L 13, on one hand, and in L 14, on the other hand. Because of lack of more considerable suggestions, we decided to close all three loci.

The matrix around the previously excavated test trench was removed with pick axes to the north, east, and west of the original trench. This was done before I arrived. I began the excavation by dividing the trench into 4 arbitrary loci. The area to the east of the test trench became 6024, the old test trench 6025, the area to the west 6026, and the northern strip 6027. We removed the material eroded into the old trench 6025 with big picks and shovels. We did not save any artifacts from this locus. We took it down to virgin soil in all but the southernmost part of the trench. In the northeast corner of 6027, we found a piece of a floor 6028.

Vidar      I worked on pit L9045 during the first part of this week. The important thing to note here is that I went to far on the western side of this pit. The actual bottom would have been more in line with that of L7146 in F7 _ÑÐ the other half of the pit.       The vast majority of the week however was spent working with the L9049 surface and the associated features. Primarily the L9052 wall, the threshold / door socket in the middle north section of L9046, and the Plaster surface L9051. Here is my interpretation of what was going on here:      L9049 was an organic material storage facility bordered on the western side by L9052 _ÑÐ a wall constructed of half pisÕó© and half mud brick. The first row (closest L9049) was of PisÕó© construction and the white pseudomorph of L9049 can actually be seen fused to the side of this row. This was followed by a row of mud bricks which were separated by a thin (1 cm) line of green material. This second row might have been followed by a third row also of mud brick construction but it was not very clear. In the Northern part of the center of L9046 was a threshold entrance to this storage area. I believe this because the ground just to the west of the door socket was harder packed and a raised surface compared to the surrounding area and it had the organic material rising up on it. Just south of the threshold were fragments of a plaster surface which I believe was the outside surface associated with this storage room. While it is poorly preserved and sloping down at a large angle, this might be attributed to another possible pit below it. The sinking of the center of the L9049 surface turned out to be caused by just such a pit (L9055). The L9049 surface itself was actually a packed mud surface with the white pseudomorph impressed onto it. The pseudomorph was also several layers thick at some points possibly showing that this area was used for this at different times or maybe overall several harvest seasons. One last thing to note was that L9049 was cut by the L9045 pit _ÑÐ however, it appeared as though the L9049 surface had its own burned edge right at the edge of the larger, later pit. Perhaps this could mean that the pit L9045 was built on a smaller earlier pit that was associated with L9049.      I took a HAP sample of L9049 and L9051. The L9051 surface was to small for a proper sample however so I removed the whole .75 by .5 surface.     ,~: F-9-2005-06-05-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9,"1226,2005-06-05," F-6-2005-06-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 6/Locus 6031,","   Daily Trench    Area F    Trench 6   June 5, 2005   Jeanne Nijhowne         This was a short excavation day as we got rained out this morning. Several of us came out to the field around 2 PM. The trench had suffered some erosion because of the rain and the flat surfaces had crusted over. I began by taking bottom levels for 6030 and top levels for 6033. We troweled off the crust to see if this still appeared to all be one locus. It did so our goal became to level it out down to 6030 and make sure we were in virgin soil. Another workman completed taking down 6031 down to that same elevation. There was a very large carbon sample against and somewhat in the north baulk of 6031. It was removed by trowel and collected in aluminum foil without touching it.    We came on virgin soil fairly quickly in 6033 and found very few artifacts although we did find our first small find, a broken spindle whorl. At the end of the day, everything was completed except the very western part of 6033. I hit rocks, lots of rocks. It was a foundation wall cut whose base was cut into virgin soil. One pot sherd stood vertically against the wall. Andy Creekmore mentioned they had found similar foundations/walls in the original test trench. The foundation became locus 6034.

Multiple new loci were assigned to these features.   The best-defined feature is a mudbrick wall that runs approx. N-S for 2.45 m before turning W for 1.25m. The angle of this corner is few degrees less than 90. The width of this wall (L2034) is 0.25 cm. Perpendicular to this wall near the corner is another wall that juts SE for 0.75m (width 20 cm) before becoming a roughly square brick patch for another 0.75m by 0.70m. This second wall is L2033. Finally the two red mudbricks previously observed in L2027 have a larger yellow mudbrick at the N end; pairing this with the 2 in the baulk at the same spot, there may be some type of wall feature or installation with 2 brick types. This is now L2029. The rest of the trench has been divided into 3 fill areas according to the associated walls. For the large NW area, L2031. There are still ashy bricky parts here (debris). In the Ne of L2034/2033, L2030 _ÑÐ this surrounds pit L2028. To the S of walls L2034/2033, L2032.      I started removing L2027 to make sense of the bricks in L2029. The soil is very ashy. The sides of the bricks are very hard and well-defined, red in color.      L2026 was also removed, so now the trench is entirely level. Beneath L2026, no new features were found so I joined this area and the former L2027 into L2032.      After trowlling around in L2028, I have determined that it is not a pit but rather a concentration of ash. I have closed the locus and made it equal to L2030, which surrounds it.

Yesterday (June 5) it was too rainy and wet to come out in the morning to excavate however I was able to come out in the evening. The circumstances, a slightly wet trench along with good late afternoon light, allowed us to see several walls that we had not previously seen. Today it was time to excavate the newly discovered areas. When I came out this morning some things were still too wet to really be able to see them clearly including L83. Because of this we spend some time shuffling back and forth between the different fill loci L78 and L69. Both loci were brought down several different times that amount to about 7cm each. Coming down in L78 helped to define the rocks of L83. It is a round rock area, possibly a cooking area or fireplace though there is no ash.    After breakfast L 79 had dried out enough to allow me to be bale to start bringing it down. We began this process with trowling and almost immediately we found layers of substance. There appear to be at least three layers on top of a pebble sub floor. There is at least one ash layer, and two white organic remains layers. The surface is very broken and pitted. It is also very hard to follow and so I am only able to catch it in patches. Part of this locus is still muddy from the rain so there is a possibility that even if the surface did touch all the walls (75, 76 and 77) we will not be able to find it.         ,~: D-8-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 69,"1232,2005-06-06," E-2-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   June 6th, 2005   J. Henecke      I was finally able to remove L79 and 72 today, which opens the trench up considerably. We dug about 5 cm into L79 and I noticed that the bricks were no longer clearly visible. It is possible that this locus was not a true wall but rather mudbrick debris or a very poorly preserved wall. There was also no sign of the surface I discovered while excavating L91. I excavated the soil beneath this as L95, and it was generic fill. There is a dark line running in the north wall of L79/96, and this may be related to L90 and an oven feature found last year.       I also removed L72. Part of the street level remained attached to the wall and did not extend beneath this. In the southwestern baulk, the wall is a single course, while it seems much higher _ÑÐ possibly 3 courses _ÑÐ in the southeastern baulk.      At the same time, I took a HAP sample (L97) from the floor L94 and sifted all soil. I also took a 3 L soil sample. The floor is small (18L), but it has the potential as an important Ubaid context. Beneath the eastern corner, I noticed a gray soil with grain imprints and carbon flecks, although this did not extend beneath the entire floor and I don_Ñét believe it is the subfloor. With Bradley_Ñés help, I removed L84, which was marked by a line of grain imprints, darker soil and the gray carbon flecked soil. This may be a degraded surface or the remnants of some other activity. It was partial and once removed I began a new locus (L98), which follows the same demarcations as L84.      Finally, we continued to excavate L93 and 86, in an attempt to reach the sounding level and to find the bottom of L70 stone wall.     ,~: E-2-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,"1233,2005-06-06," D-5-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5210,","   Kenantepe 2005Page 1   Datum: 587.95   Trench: D.5   Date: June 6, 2005         The artifacts found near the hearth surfaces (L.5225 and L.5227) indicate that this area had a specific function related to food production, such as food preparation and cooking. The artifacts near the hearth may have been used for grinding cereals. I have taken a soil sample with the hope that there may be some seeds fallen while food was prepared. On the other hand, the lack of observing the actual surface that these artifacts should be sitting on makes the soil sample collection a little unsafe. Since there is only this outdoor but domestic activity could have been recorded in this trench, then perhaps, it is not unreasonable to think that there is a building nearby it or buildings surrounding it. Such buildings may be located in the S or W sections of the trench within the range of 856.00-585.80 m.                                                                                                ,~: D-5-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5/Locus 5210,"1234,2005-06-06," F-22-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 22/Locus 3,","   Daily Trench    Area F, Trench 22   June 6, 2005   M. Baldi      Very little work was done on this trench today as the workers were employed mostly in F 19 and F 20. This much expanded trench did need a little bit of work on straightening the baulks which was done. Of course there are only 2 walls and this work did not take long. Nevertheless, a little bit of work continued on removing the fill under the cobble surface. As more cobble are noted on the East baulk, the idea is to lower the trench to what as of now, appears to be a new surface, made up of several courses of cobble. A preliminary idea proposes that the commonality between all of the lower trenches lies with the upper layers of cobble surfaces we have been removing. Having said that, it seems that this new cobble layer may constitute a new and separate surface, made up, as stated above, of several courses of stone. Our plan is to carefully remove the fill of Locus # 3 down to this new level of cobble and see, first, how it relates, if at all, to the surfaces already removed. Second, what relationships, if any, can be established between all of the trenches based on the new layer. It should be noted that the new cobble surface is composed of larger cobblestones than those encountered as part of Locus 2.   On the northeast corner of the southeast quadrant a large pit was located. It seems, at least at this early point, that it cuts through the cobble surface, but the relationship between the two is unclear at this point. The pit was given Locus # 4 and we began emptying it. As we get to the cobble surface tomorrow we will have a better idea of how to proceed.           ,~: F-22-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 22/Locus 3,"1235,2005-06-06," G-9-2005-06-06 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9/Locus 22,","   Daily Trench    Area G Trench 9   Area C Trench 1   June 6, 2005      Today was frenetic. We are working on opening up C1 where I worked three years ago as well as running a sounding in G9. In G9 the sounding (L22) was placed in the southwest corner of locus 20 so the western border of the sounding was the western baulk and the southern border was the raised portion of locus 15 in the southern section of the trench. The goal was to see how deep the cultural levels extend, especially since in a similar depth Barish in G7 has hit virgin soil. We began going down in 25cm increments with new loci beginning at each interval. Locus 22, the first level, was relatively uneventful. The ground was very, very hard and compact and it took longer to accomplish than was anticipated. Some pottery was found, but not a great deal. Locus 23 was a bit more interesting. Within that locus there was thick band of burnt soil and ash. In the middle of the sounding there was found a broken vessel base filled with ash. This was recovered and will hopefully be tested for residues. The third level of the sounding (L24) contained a great deal of pebbly material, similar to L16 of the southern half of the trench. Possibly this is another pebble dump or layers of pebble surface accumulating over time. We will continue the sounding tomorrow as well. Barish will possibly be running the sounding while I continue to work on C1 cleaning.      The C1 cleaning is also going a bit slower than hoped.

This is located in the central and the northern part of the trench. At the end of the working day we could see clearly the inside of the room, L 16 (SE wall with length 3.70 m). Close to its south corner we found the fireplace. The ceramic material was not much but enough to identify Chalcolithic Period. The wall (L 15) was made by the mud, sand, pebbles and some cobbles. After all, I thing that in L 12 (which was closed) we were going through the upper part of the destruction of this same wall. Outside of the wall (L 17) we again found not big amount of ceramics and, which was similar with that from inside of the room. Also we found some animal bones in the areas of both sides.

Towards the southern end of the trench, a potter base was visible. Since I didn_Ñét want it broken by someone walking on it, we excavated it separately before beginning pickaxing the matrix. Much to our surprise, it was a whole bowl. When we turned it over, there was another bowl inside the first. I gave the bowls separate KT numbers but left them together so they could be taken to the lab safely. The larger pot is KT3 and the smaller is KT4.

The baulks and floor were straightened; additionally detail work was done on the fireplace or oven discard and was removed as part of Locus 3. Also the rocks near the South baulk on the southeast quadrant were cleaned photographed and then removed. I had thought that maybe this were place there as a way to cover or mark a burial, but after removing some centimeters from under them, nothing was found. But, this is still a possibility. One of the rocks was interesting, as it was constituted of a fine sand, perhaps from the Dicle, but very hard, and rounded on one end. This is a kind of gray sandstone and its provenance is unknown.

Since the suggestion that this locus is a living surface associated with the hearth surfaces L.5225 and L.5227 is not unreasonable and the level we are right now is below this context, I closed this locus and gave a new locus number 5233 to the entire 4x4 area. The soil in this locus seems to be soft and ashy in the S half while the N half is much harder, a little crumbly and orange-buff color. Perhaps, we are reaching to another surface layer during which the activities were related to firing caused to have ashy soil texture.      Work in SW sounding went on with L.5233 for about 25cm.

Nijhowne      We began the day by continuing the excavation of locus 3. We are excavating by arbitrary loci of 25 cm each using big picks as there has been no evidence of surfaces or other features besides the conglomerate wall-locus 1. The fill is hard and compact. My intention is to level off the trench at an elevation of 569.80 meters. The reason is that the pebble surface in the east profile of F6 lies at 569.43. I want to start excavating in thinner arbitrary loci as we get closer to the surface so we don_Ñét accidentally chop through it. We found a half of a fish net weight in the matrix, KT4.   As we excavated down along the wall, locus 1, it appeared that the wall stopped after 2 to 3 courses. The big conglomerate rocks seemed to be resting on fill. As we reached the bottom of our arbitrary locus 3, we found a stony surface just east of the wall, locus 1. It looks like a floor but it is not in good condition. I designated this as the base of locus 3 and the surface as locus 4. There is no way at this point to know if the surface locus 4 is associated with the wall locus 1 or possibly runs underneath it. For that reason, I completed excavating locus 3 and then decided to remove the wall. We removed the first layer of conglomerates only to find that there were more stones beneath. I think now that the large conglomerate on the plan view of June 8 partially slid off the wall which is the reason it was resting on fill. We removed the matrix between the stones at the top of the wall with trowels and then lifted the stones off. At the end of the day, we still hadn_Ñét finished removing all the matrix between the stones.      ,~: F-21-2005-06-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21/Locus 1,"1247,2005-06-07," D-8-2005-06-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 69,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   June 7, 2005   E.O.      Today we removed half of the eastern baulk expanding the northern section of the trench 1.3 meters in an area 6.2 meters long. This means that when you are looking at the trench while standing on the southern baulk there is a shallow protrusion on the right side on most of the northern side of the trench. This expansion could not have been extended to the whole trench because of the slope of the Tepe. Once this area was done and cleaned we were able to follow walls L70 and L71 eastward until they connected with a north-south wall creating a small (1.4m x 1.02m) interior space. I kept this section of the wall and an extension of L71 because the corner where the new wall met with L71 was the most clear. This means that L71 is not an _ÑÉL_Ñé shaped locus which runs east-west beginning near the west baulk touching L73, continues west for approx 2.5 meters and then turns north before meeting with L70. The enclosed space made by these three walls plus L72 is L83. Due to the problems I had finding surfaces in the other interior spaces (L79 above surface L85 and L80 above surface L82) I plan to go very very slowly in this locus. In addition to working on expanding the trench and bringing down L83 3cm I was able to continue to articulate surface L85.   The part of L77 that runs into the southern baulk showed up in D10 the new trench immediately to the south. It looks like L76 (which runs north south) might also be present in D10.

Baldi      Extensive work was conducted in three areas of the trench. One aim was to lower the trench to a leveled surface. Work was also continued on the pit (Locus 4) until its bottom was reached. Materials were recovered visually, and large soil samples were taken from two different levels, one from the middle part of the pit, while the other from the area near the bottom of the pit. One out of every 5 buckets of fill from the pit was sifted and materials were collected accordingly. A considerable amount of carbon was carefully collected and bagged in aluminium foil. The pit was measured, photographed, and made ready for its removal. On the eastern half of the trench and near the southeast quadrant, work was undertaken to detail and articulate the cobble surface. It should be noted that the cobble does not continue into the western half of the trench. On the northeast quadrant the cobble was cut by the pit L 4. Near the southeast corner, (and by looking at the southwest corner of F 4) the cobble surface appears to have been made of several courses of stone. This is I suppose, unusual for a simple floor surface, or even for a road. The laborious placing and arrangement of the various courses must have been a time consuming job done by a worker with a very specific purpose. This purpose is at this time unclear but it is hoped that as the excavation progresses we will get a better understanding of the cobble surfaces, and the usage and/or habitation of this area.        ,~: F-22-2005-06-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 22/Locus 3,"1249,2005-06-07," E-2-2005-06-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   June 7th, 2005   J.

We covered the line with a tarp, hoping that the moisture might make things more visible tomorrow.     ,~: F-8-2005-06-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8029,"1255,2005-06-07," F-20-2005-06-07 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 20/Locus 3,","   Daily Trench    Area F, Trench 20   June 7, 2005   M.

Then we decided to divide the L13 into two equal squares. The North portion is being excavated so far for 30 cm but nothing is showing up yet. We_Ñéll try to go down at this site which is now L14 at least another 50 cm more. But I have to check the my levels and I have to ask Andy Creekmore what the datum is, because my points do not fit the points of Marco Baldi.

Nijhowne         I began the day by completing a more detailed plan view of the wall locus 1. Then we photographed the wall as we still weren_Ñét sure where the base of the wall was located. We proceeded with removing the remainder of the matrix between the large stones with trowels. Between two large conglomerate rocks at an elevation of 569.97 meters, we found a layer of pebbles. The spot is marked on Plan A, June 8, 2005. The pebbles are clearly part of the wall construction. We decided to remove the remainder of the large stones in the wall as we still didn_Ñét know exactly where its base was. We removed all the large stones in the wall (except the one in the baulk which we had to pedestal). Underneath the large stones we found some metal which may possibly be slag KT10.    Underneath we found a layer of very compact clay. But in the eastern section, the pebble layer continued (see Plan B). We removed the clay and pebbles/coarse gravel down to the level of surface locus 4 with small picks and trowels. But the pebbles/coarse gravel kept going below the level of the floor. It is clear that the floor locus 4 is associated with the wall locus 1. It most definitely does not go under the wall. I didn_Ñét want to dig a hole trying to remove all the pebbles so I stopped excavating the base of the wall, locus 1 and removed locus 4 with small picks and trowels. Very few artifacts were found in the floor. Then we finished removing the pebble/gravel layer. It ended approximately 3 cm below the floor locus 4.    After the removal of the floor and wall, we were back to a level trench with no discernible features. We ended the day with another large pick pass which removed part of locus 5.

Thereafter we scraped the whole area.      Bradley took a look at wall 2034 and observed that we had the lowest part of a course and another beneath it as of how.      We are continuing to dig 2031 and 2032 with a hand pick. The soil is still ashy in the corner of 2031 and pottery is frequent in 2032.      I took control of the surface in 2030 and was able to find another patch of pebble surface alongside 2034 wall as well as scattered, flat-lying sherds, buit they are not all connected clearly, nor do they seem to be at the same elevation as the first pebble patch in the corner, which is higher. Until I figure out what_Ñés going on for sure, I am tentatively assigning L2035 to this surface.

Today we were able to follow several pre-existing walls after we took down locus 86, which is the fill/cleaning locus for the newly opened part of the trench.    Once we had traced all these walls I was able to assign new loci. The new walls were two sections of wall that extended into the new eastern baulk. I made the paralleling pieces of wall extensions of the pre-existing walls L70 and L71. L70 is the northern most wall while L71 is below it to the south.    For the new section of L71 we only found one row of brick though in other area of wall L71 there are two and three rows. Once these walls were completely articulated I assigned three new loci to the new areas created by the walls in the northeast corner. The area enclosed by wall L70 and the baulks became L88. South of that was another small enclosed _ÑÉroom_Ñé which appears to line up with the other two small rooms. This area became L87. To the south of that we have L89, which does not have borders of walls but instead is partially bordered in the west by the circle of rocks L81.

Henecke      All the loci to the north of L45 have been combined into L101 and L104, which are different because the soil in L104 is much harder and compact than L101, which is primarily ashy fill. The depth of this distinct gray ashy soil is considerable, and it is possible that this represents a continuous interior space.       Within L103, I found the beginnings of an ash pit, which currently has a kidney bean shape. The ash is very loose and easy to excavate. It contained a few bones and burnt ceramics. I was finally able to remove all of L70, and there are faint outlines of mudbricks at the bottom.      I was able to do very little work in L90 or 92, and I am hoping to remove both these features tomorrow. I was able to flatten L100 off, and I will continue excavation here when the entire trench reaches the sounding level.     ,~: E-2-2005-06-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,"1261,2005-06-08," G-7-2005-06-08 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 7/Locus 16,","   Daily    Area G, Trench 7   June 8, 2005   Baris UZEL          When we dug L58 yesterday, we found virgin pebbles area.

It turns out that this feature was NOT a wall but a pit filled with cobbles and a mass of sherds. Some of the sherds were broken when they were thrown here and the pottery collected from this feature may well be restored as a few pots and large vessels. The bottom of the pit L.3 was at 587.40 m. The brick pile also turns out to be a large pit damaging the room L.7 severely. The pit has given the locus number 11. First, it was made into room L.7 as a circular shaped pit and some ash was dumped inside. Later, the bricks were thrown inside again probably with some ash, because after 587.50m, any space in between the bricks were surrounded with ash. The pit also damaged the almost the entire W wall L.10. We stopped excavating the pit L.11 at 587.06 m, because the bricks and ash were removed. For the moment it is not clear, if we reached to the bottom of this pit, but loose, orange color soil mixed w/ small pebbles were beginning to appear. Thus, the goal for next working day is to find out if this loose soil is part of the pit or it is an earlier layer under the pit.      We excavated about 8-10 cm inside the room L.7 to articulate the E wall L.9 and find out how much of the white plaster is preserved.

Today we continued to bring down all the fill loci. These include 78, 89, 87, 88 and 83. In locus 83 we had hit a skull on June 8th. Today we worked on articulating this brial to bring it out. We at first thought that the skull, which was the highest point of the burial and the first bones that we found, was positioned with the face down. The uppermost bones were very broken and so to articulate the skull we first went down inside and then around the outside of the skull. When we went down inside we found ridges inside the skull which indicated that it was the back of the head. This meant that the face had been up but was so broken that we were unable to identify it. The skull was found only 15 cm below topsoil which might explain why it is in such bad condition. We did find a portion of the jaw with teeth intact. It had full adult molars but the skull size was relatively small, certainly not the size of that of an adult human so i believe that the individual was approx 12 when they died We did not find a full skeleton, instead the only other bones we found were some long bones approx 10cm to the east of the skull. These bones extended into the brick of wall L70. We decided to carve out part of the brick they were stuck into to extract them. The bones extended several centimeters into the brick. The skull and a few long bones were all that we found.      Yesterday when we were bringing down locus 69 we found other bricks which changed the size of the locus. Along with a change in size the soil density changed to become more hard. These two facts made me decide to change loci. The area which was previously 69 is now 91.      When we were cleaning L88 we found another wall which runs parallel to and abuts the east baulk. i decided to make this wall a part of L70 since the walls are bonded. This means that L88 is surrounded on the west, east, and south by wall L70 with the northern baulk making the fourth side.     ,~: D-8-2005-06-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 69,"1270,2005-06-09," G-9-2005-06-09-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 2   Area G   Trench 9   June 9, 2005      This was the closing week for Trench G9. We did not dig the entire trench down to virgin soil, but sunk a sounding (L) in the southwest corner of the northern section of the trench and went down to what we think must be virgin deposit in that area. The last meter of the sounding was filled with pebble fill, that had little to no cultural material in it. Perhaps this part of the tepe was simply a pebble dump or perhaps this was the natural geological configuration of this area during occupation.      There were three main points of interest during this last week of excavation for G9: continuing excavation of L16 pebble surface, working towards the in situ pot smash in L15 and in the G9 sounding especially with L23. The pebble surface had originally been partially picked through before I realized what was happening. We later HAP_Ñéd the surface and began its removal. In horizontal excavation there was no evidence of a break between levels of pebble dump, but there might have been vertical evidence. The pebbles seemed to almost move up the trench in a wavelike pattern building upon the mudbricky area in the southwestern corner of the trench. This may have been the organic buildup of a surface or of some sort of pebble dump. There was a good deal of cultural material here, though, so it was not the same as the virgin pebble layer we found in the G9 sounding. In the end we were not able to completely remove the pebble fill and screen it all. Partially this was abandoned because of our not being sure of it actually being a surface in the first place.      The in situ pot smash of L15 was also interesting. Two relatively complete vessels were recovered. The larger pot was removed in two separate KTs. Originally it was thought that the vessel was standing upright, but upon complete removal of the vessel, it had been upside down. Soil samples were also taken from the vessel interior.      Finally there was the G9 sounding with locus 23. The majority of the sounding was uneventful. Locus 23, however, was a thick layer of burnt earth and ash. In the sounding was a partial vessel filled with ash. The ash inside the vessel was taken as well. Everything was photographed and recorded. The rest of the sounding was filled with what we believe to be a sterile pebble fill extending down over a meter. The trench was stopped at this point and I was relocated to C1 on the west side of the tepe.     ,~: G-9-2005-06-09-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 9,"1271,2005-06-09," F-2-2005-06-09-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2,","   Weekly Summary   Area F, Trench 2   Week 4, ending June 9, 2005   Melissa Eppihimer      During this week a number of features emerged in F2. The first was the corner of a mudbrick platform/installation in the SW area of the trench (2029). The bricks on the outside of this feature were hard and burnt red/orange. Later in the week, the other end of this feature was uncovered in neighboring trench F7, which showed that the shape of the feature is a rectangle. The function or full extent of the feature remains unclear.      Second, after a day of heavy rain when we did not work on the site, I arrived to find visible on the surface a series of walls. Although the walls were all connected, I divided them into two parts because I suspected that they may not be a single construction. The longest wall runs N-S and then at a corner turns W (2034). Extending E from this wall, close to but not at the edge of the corner, is 2033. After approximately one meter, this thin wall becomes a wide square mudbrick block.       I divided the soil around these walls into three sections. The _ÑÉinterior_Ñé of the structure, that is the area to the E of 2034 and N of 2033 is 2030. To the west of 2033 is 2031. To the S of the structure is 2032.       We hand picked each of the three soil areas several times throughout the week. In 2030, we found a surface (2035). Initially, this surface was identified as a pebbly cluster in the SW corner close the junction of the walls. Unfortunately, the worker did not trace the surface but cut through it. Elsewhere, we came across the surface, but it was less pebbly and better identified by the flat-lying pot-sherds. This surface was removed as a HAP sample.       In 2031, the area closest to the corner was very ashy and full of mudbrick debris.      In 2032, nothing was unusual beyond the relatively large quantity of pottery that was coming out.      At the end of the week, it seems that we have not yet reached the bottom of any of the walls or features.      ,~: F-2-2005-06-09-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2,"1272,2005-06-09," F-21-2005-06-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21/Locus 5,","   Daily Trench    Area F   Trench 21   June 9, 2005   J. Nijhowne         We began the day by taking levels for locus 5. We are part way through the locus. We did a second large pick pass, took levels again and photographed the bottom of locus 5. At this point, one of the workers pointed out a spot in the middle of the trench that seemed to be filled with sand. It was much softer and looser than the surrounding matrix. We outlined the area of softness and it seemed to be a large round pit. Its diameter is approximately 1.10 meters. I designated it locus 6. We defined the edge by troweling from the harder matrix towards the soft center. The edges were quite well defined.    We removed the first 10 cm or so with trowels. Even small picks weren_Ñét necessary. Then we took our first soil sample KT 5. We also screened 1 bucket of dirt through the large meshed screen to see if we were missing anything. We weren_Ñét. At this point we started coming down on some very large sherds that all appeared to be part of the same vessel. A large rim sherd lay vertically against the east profile of the pit. We removed the sherds as we went down. We set these sherds to be cataloged as a separate KT which is now KT6. As we went down, we had to excavate by lying on our stomachs and reaching into the pit so we didn_Ñét crush anything.    As the pit narrowed towards the bottom, we started coming across bone fragments. As a pot burial was a possibility, we were on the look out for them. Still, some of the very first bone fragments were added to the animal bag bone. This bag, KT2, was set aside with the human bone because it likely contains a few fragments of the skeleton. At this point, we quit throwing out the matrix. Because it was the very end of the day, we collected what bones we could including one tooth and wrapped them in foil. We covered the matrix with sacks so we could bring out the fine screens after the weekend.      ,~: F-21-2005-06-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21/Locus 5,"1273,2005-06-09," F-8-2005-06-09-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8,","   Weekly Summary   Area F, Trench 8   Week 4, ending June 9, 2005   Melissa Eppihimer      I opened this trench on June 4th, 2005. The trench, a 9 by 4 m trench, was last dug in 2001. At that time the trench was one entire locus of fill (8026), so we started with a big pick pass across the entire trench to clear it of any contamination from erosion or recent activity in the area. The SE corner of the trench was still very close to top soil, so this was separated in L8028 and the rest designated 8028. After this was completed, nothing was visible in the trench so I designated it L8029, a fill locus. After three big-pick passes, several soil differentiations were visible. Two strips of bricky soil ran SW to NE across the trench. These and the three areas of soil that surrounded them were labeled locus 8030 to 8034. However, because the soil dried out before we got to dig these (because of delays with workers), we could not retrace some of these lines. Therefore, we had the workers scrape where we thought the \walls\ would be, but could only identify the SW corner of \wall\ 8033. In the area to the west of 8033, we decided to take a small pick pass across using the old locus 8029, rather than make an arbitrary differentiation at this point. Again, the divide was difficult to see because the soil was drying so quickly. We kept the area in the SE as 8030 and small-picked once through here. At the end of the week, little was certain in the trench. We are unsure whether we have walls or sloping layers that have been cut flat to resemble walls.

We closed loci 1105 and 1104. The ground is very wet due to the rain and the plastic. In the southeast of the trench it appears to have some scattered mud bricks. We are scraping off the top 2-3cm to get a better look. The mudbrick is difficult to distinguish because it is too wet. There seems to be three flat lying mud bricks, but not in any order. This is directly below what we thought was a collapsed mudbrick wall.      The rest was all cleaning. We found a hard backed mudbrick or some other form of nonpottery ceramics. No other loci have become visible yet.      There is one small area of L1102 left by the stair.      We will start now cleaning loci one for east and one for the west. The eastern locus will be 1107.     ,~: C-1-2005-06-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1102,"1275,2005-06-09," G-10-2005-06-09 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 10/Locus 15,","   Daily Trench    Area: G   Trench: 10   June 9, 2005       Diana Backus      As we decided yesterday, we started to develop the mud bricks in two walls 9L 15 and L 19). It was tougher than we thought. It was deposited already very dry film over the walls, which almost totally obstructed our work. Nevertheless we could pick out some mud bricks. After removing partly the northern part of the wall _ÑÐ L 15, we were able to see the mud bricks_Ñé outlines. During of the removing of L 15 we did not receive any artifacts and the consistence of the soil showed up mud brick material. Hence, I can_Ñét see why L 15 shouldn_Ñét be a wall. The small extension after SW corner of L 15 turned out to be just a chunk of derbies _ÑÐ pebbles, shards and mud brick material, obviously deposited after destruction. After removing the other wall _ÑÐ L 19 we came across of different situation. Actually the mud bricks here were recognizable just to the outlined northern corner, after what we hit wvery hart, felt strongly resembling pize.

Many of the sections removed were part of what we believe is a collapsed brick wall that could have fallen from south to north during and following a large conflagration which also deposited large amounts of ash on the floor of what we believe was a structure that suffered this fate. It is noteworthy to mention that some of the bricks were burned and hardened by the fire. Another possibility is that some of these bricks were part of a fireplace wall but this is difficult to support at this time.    With most of L8 removed and with just a few centimeters of it left, we began popping the left-over brick material resting on the surface.

While a majority of the excavation this season is focused on _ÑÉUbaid and Late Chalcolithic periods, this side of the tepe has not been extensively investigated in the last two seasons. This is mainly due to the fact that these trenches seem to be firmly entrenched in the 2nd and 3rd millennia BC. Bradley decided, however, that it would be a good idea to also investigate what was happening on this side of the tepe since there is a gap in our understanding of life here between Late Chalcolithic and the 2nd millennium BC. So here I am! and I love it.      This opening week (actually half a week for this trench) was focused mainly on cleaning and establishing where the old loci were and beginning to move down to clean loci.

And this year by setting up this 1x1m sounding our aim was to reveal it out if in case the area might be hiding any architectural features. Besides this we will be also able to observe if this part of the main mound will be coming up with any Late Chalcolithic or Ubaid period settlements up.       When we started to excavate the sounding the elevation was 587. 18 and we closed it up with 584. 40. The excavation of this sounding took three days. The only thing that we faced was that the area was covered just with fills. In each 25 cm we were able to observe that the sounding was just coming up with new fill layers. But when we reached to 585. 52 (Locus 6) we have faced a pit, which was mostly placed in the south baulk. We were only able to observe like 10% of it but we were able to take the ash out of it ( 585.37 is the elevation for the ash sample). On the other hand, we also have faced a surface which was located in the north baulk. But it was very loose that it was too late for us to recognize it.

Trench 5.      Introduction      D 5 is a continuation of the 10 x 5m trench last excavated in the 2002 season on the eastern slope of Kenan Tepe. At the end of the 2002 season the trench was divided along north-south lines with excavated features of Ubaid domestic architecture (including L5139, L5140, L5149) and an oven (L5126, L5127) in the southern section. However, there were a limited number of features in the northern section, except for a human burial (L5137) in a later pit in a slip trench in the northwestern area. At the beginning of the 2004 season there was an expectation that these Ubaid features might overlie an earlier phase of habitation in the form of a separate house and that the northern section of the trench might also provide additional Ubaid contexts with further excavation. To further investigate these possibilities a new parallel 6 x 4m trench, D9, was also opened to the east of D5 aiming to capture any continuation of the Ubaid contexts.      Summary of the excavations      The primary method of excavation was by the use of small picks to strip 3-5cm increments of material from tightly designated areas with troweling employed during the fine excavation of surfaces and features. Where possible each surface was also sampled following guidelines set out in the Kenan Tepe Household Archaeology Protocol.      On average, during the 2004 season the level of the trench was lowered to 586.13m in the northern section of the trench and 586.52m in the southern section from average starting levels of 586.8m and 587.15. However, in the last three days of the season a 1 x 1m sounding (5202, 5203, 5204) was excavated in the southwestern corner of D5 with a final level of 585.31.       As a guide the northern and eastern baulk sections provided an idea of the orientation of the paleo-landscape of the eastern side of the Tepe - pronounced ashy layers in the northern baulk and a layer of gravel in the eastern section that makes a sharp dip downward at approximately the 2m mark from the northern baulk. The ancient slope of the hill ran in a generally southwest to the northeast direction.      As a result of this it will probably be more useful to summarize the excavations in D5 by dividing the trench into a southern, a central and a northern section. The main reason for this is that the ashy layers in the northern baulk section showed as a blackish line running northwest-southeast across the trench. As the excavation continued from south to north we were therefore progressing \downhill\ in stages.                The southern section of D5      This section was characterized by thick layers of fill (5164, 5167, 5190) between the 2002 contexts and significant features especially in the southwestern section of the trench. During troweling it was possible to distinguish boundaries in this fill through consistency and compactness of material leading to the hypothesis that this area had been artificially leveled in advance of the construction of the 2002 Ubaid house. These fill levels were contained by wall 5170 that followed the orientation of the 2002 west-east wall although this feature had only a thin horizontal slice remaining and was not connected by any mud brick courses to the wall above.      Although the Ubaid domestic context had been divided into interior and exterior areas in the 2002 season the 2004 excavation revealed a number of floor surfaces (5169, 5185, 5194) that were initially considered to be interconnected. These were different from the compacted silt surfaces of the 2002 season in that they were readily visible as compacted silt and pebble layers and the overlying fill could be slowly levered off with a trowel. Although floor 5169 in the southwestern section was relatively level in terms of the orientation of the trench both 5194 and 5185 sloped from west to east into the baulk shared with D9. During excavation it was also noted that 5185 bonded with wall 5170 but that this wall overlaid 5169.      In the southeastern corner of the trench the Ubaid contexts were cut both by the edge of the oven found in trench D9 and by a mud brick lined pit (5180) both of which were later period.      There was therefore no clear evidence of an earlier Ubaid structure, although the surfaces, pits, layers of fill and wall suggested the 2002 house had gone through a number of construction phases.      With the lack of evidence for a separate house it was decided to test the hypothesis that the 2002 house was resting on virgin soil and a sounding (5202, 5203 and 5204) was dug in the southwestern corner of the trench to a depth of 1.3m below the final locus level (5197). However, as well as continued pottery finds, in the eastern section of the sounding pieces of mud brick showed through between 75 and 80cm below the level of 5197 and two pieces of corrugated tile (KT2, 5204) were recovered from the lowest level.      The central section of D5      The preliminary dominant feature in this area was the oven excavated in 2002 as a tripartite structure _ÑÐ a central core (5156), a surround of fill (5155) and a hemispherical section of mud outer-walling (5157). Although the oven had been proxy dated to the Ubaid from a spatially adjacent feature_Ñés carbon sample a surface scrape of the central core immediately showed two potsherds that implied that the oven might be later. The central core was therefore excavated as a series of layers (5171, 5173, 5178) that were derived from a section cut from the front of the feature (5172) and pottery and carbon samples collected for analysis.       Although 5157 contained mud brick debris the oven structure in trench D9 provided an outline of how a later oven might be preserved in section with a thick beehive of ashy material and distinct mud brick layers for the surrounding containing wall. The eastern baulk section for the D5 feature showed that the central core was the active element of the tripartite structure and it was not clear whether there was a surrounding ashy fill that had been contained within a constructed outer shell. The excavation of the fill surrounding the core suggested that this material was similar in color and consistency to fill encountered in other areas of the trench and not primarily ashy. Having excavated all the features of the oven a circular indentation was noted that identified locus 5191 as a pit. The hypothesis was therefore that the oven was actually the central core area alone and had been built onto or into an earlier pit.      In the western section there were a number of indicators that this area had been used as an activity area in the Ubaid period (5174, 5198). Firstly, it underlay the chaff-covered surface from the 2002 season and abutted wall 5181. Secondly, as the excavation proceeded it followed a south-north slope identified by flat-lying sherds and a complete decorated cooking vessel (KT40, 5174) and a smoothed stone (KT8, 5199) under which grain impressions were preserved.      As more concrete proof a thick layer of rocks, 1.5 x 1.1m in area, embedded in compacted silty material was excavated and HAP sampled. This contrasted sharply with the floors in the southern section of the trench in area and description of material within the silt.      The northern section of the trench      The aim in the this area of the trench was to excavate beneath the thick ashy layer noted in the northern baulk section and to assess whether this layer provided a useful stratigraphic indicator of the boundary between the Ubaid and later periods.      Two walls, one below and one resting on the ashy layer were noted toward the end of the season. 5183 rested on the ashy layer and was associated with Chalcolithic pottery (KT9, 5199). 5201 was only visible in plan except in the half-section of pit 5201 where mud brick outlines were recorded beneath the ashy layer.      A notable find in the northeastern corner of the trench was an inscribed cylinder seal or bead (KT10, 5182) inscribed in a zigzag pattern in two registers.      Interpretation of the results of the season      Although there are limited opportunities to discuss dating a general summary of hypotheses could be put forward. The southern section of the trench revealed interior features that were part of an earlier phase (or phases) of the 2002 house that were then covered with fill to provide a level base for later occupation.   Associated with this is the hypothesis that the activity area in the central section of the trench, exterior to the house, was also used before the chaff-covered surface of the 2002. However, it seems unlikely that the cooking vessel and the smooth stone grinding surface would be abandoned, although any ritual explanation would be hard to argue.      The later pits and the oven along the eastern side of the trench imply that this area is associated with trench D9 rather than with the Ubaid and again it is worth considering the slope of the ancient hill which may have moved further eastwards over time. Therefore during the Ubaid the side of the hill may have been more flush with the 2002 house and then, having been filled in over time, employed in a more \industrial\ capacity in later periods.      Another possibility connected with the slope of the hill is that wall 5201 in the northern section of the trench may act as a retaining wall rather than in any domestic context and, if Ubaid in date, be associated with the exterior activity area to the north of the 2002 house.      The results of the excavation in D5 in the 2004 season have therefore been determined by the transformation of the shape of the hill in requiring the leveling of areas in earlier periods and the shaping of the Tepe by human occupation that allowed new areas to be exploited.        ,~dc-terms:title: D-5-2005-06-010-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"1284,2005-06-10," D-5-2005-06-010-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,","D-5-2005   Kenantepe 2005Page 1   Datum: 587.95   Trench: D.5   Date: June 10, 2005      TRENCH D.5 SUMMARY FOR 2005 SEASON      Trench D.5 was reopened for the season 2005 on May 16th and work was stopped on June 8th. There were a few goals for working in this trench. One of them was to continue horizontal excavations in order to see whether there was any earlier Ubaid architecture below the Ubaid house found during 2002 season. If there was any, we hoped to expose preserved building remains and record them as much as possible and compare them with the later one. Along with the comparisons of the artifacts, we hoped to distinguish any temporal change in spatial arrangements, architectural style and function of the meaningfully established spaces. The second goal was to document the change in settlement size in this part of the mound as we go deep. The last goal was to see how deep the Ubaid occupation layers continue and at which level the virgin soil could be reached in this part of the mound. With these questions in mind, we also reopened the trench D.9 in the E of D.5.      Unfortunately, the first goal was not achieved this year. Excavations showed that below the Ubaid house, there was not any architecture built in this part of the mound until we stopped the excavations at about 585.69 m. This indicates that during the earlier phases, the Ubaid occupations were elsewhere and the area where the trench D.5 was probably used as the open-air activities. I was able to detect some surfaces (L.5216 and L.5218) that were preserved only in small areas less than 1m2. The concentration of very hard, fine clay mixed with pebbles and large size chert flakes (L.5209) in the western part of the trench and the pile of very coarse sand mixed with small pebbles (L.5219) to the NW of the trench indicated to me that, perhaps, there were multiple activities. They may have been different types but consecutive related to one major task, such as preparing mud-bricks for wall constructions. The other possibility is that the activities may have been different and for short duration. Maybe that is why the surfaces L.5216 and L.5218 were very small. After completion of one short-term activity, the surface might have been left for good and the next activity might have been taking place nearby. It is important to note here that the nature of the outdoor activities are unknown, although we seem to have been documenting the remnants of them this year. It seems that human activities were intense and this area was repeatedly in use allowing for the accumulation of more than one meter thickness of fill.      The most significant discovery of the outside activities is the food preparation and possibly baking and cooking found in the S of the trench. Number of grinding stones, stone balls, and some hammers and pestles found near to each other in L. 5226 and L.5228 and their association with the hearth, which had two heavily burned plaster surfaces built on top of each other, implicated that firing activity was distinct. Additionally, ashy soil texture visible in the W section with more than 10cm thickness confirms that the hearth was used for a long time and hearth was rebuilt and the plaster    Page 2      was regularly renewed. It seemed to me that the heart was built higher than the living surface around it. The finds associated with it were begun appearing at similar level but more and more of them were recovered in the following 15cm as the excavations went on. Some of those finds were turned up side down implying that they were not in situ and moved. I suggest that this might be related with the natural slope of the mound that may have moved the artifacts and the living surface around the heart was adjusting itself with the downward form of the mound over the course of time. Thus, the slope was probably causing the actual surface disappear and disturbing the location of the finds.      In relation with the slope of the mound, the wall L.5212 deserves a note. It was initially found in earlier seasons and it was clear that the wall was continuing further down. At the end of the excavations in this trench, it was not clear if we had reached its bottom. A test I made on its n side showed that it may not be continuing further down and its bottom might be at the depth of 585.91 meter. If this is true the height of the wall becomes almost a meter. It has only one row of bricks but the size of the bricks is not obvious. The brick near the W section seems to be 70x22x5-6cm. This wall might have been built to draw the edge of the site and protect the area just S of it against erosion.      We excavated about one meter in this trench and there was no significant change observable in the size of the Ubaid settlement. However, I believe that the edge of the settlement in the NE got 40 cm shorter. It, thus, seems that the settlement was probably not enlarging so distinctively but the debris from ongoing activities was accumulating over time. If we can excavate in this trench next year, we may have better understanding about whether the site was smaller or not in the earlier phases.      In order to find out the depth of the Ubaid mound and locate the depth of the virgin soil, we continued digging in the SW sounding. We started at the depth of 585.31m with L.5214 and by changing the locus number every 25 cm, we reached to the depth of 583.48 m with L.5234. It is certain that the virgin soil has not been reached yet and the artifacts continued appearing with varying amounts in every locus assigned to the sounding. We found two distinct features in the sounding. Topmost one is L.5222 burned plaster surface found at the level 585.04-585.00 m. It is SE quadrant was found in the sounding but its structure was very similar to the hearth surfaces L.5225 and L.5227 found in the S of the trench. It was free of artifacts and a few sherds collected with its locus number may or may not be associated. The pottery from this sounding has not been studied yet and it is impossible to talk about the differences in the use of pottery that may imply change in style and more.       Due to not achieving the most important goal, recovering more earlier date architectural remains, this trench may not be excavated in the coming years. However, the SW sounding may be excavated further so that the sampling of more artifacts and reaching to the sterile soil may become possible.        ,~: D-5-2005-06-010-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 5,"1285,2005-06-10," D-9-2005-06-010-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,","D-9-2005   Kenantepe 2005Page 1   Datum: 587.95   Trench: D.9   Date: June 10, 2005      TRENCH SUMMARY FOR 2005 SEASON      With the hope to find architectural remains in D.5 and see their possible extensions in further E within the trench D.10, we reopened D.10 on May 19th. Unfortunately, architecture in this trench was lacking as in D.5 and more than the E half of the trench was representing the heavily accumulated fill over the Ubaid settlement. The line separating the Ubaid settlement form the later fill was already discovered in the last season. This line continued in NW-SE direction this year and the east side of it was always consisted of ash fill and orange color bricky soil (L.39).      There was only one feature (L.41) in this trench that its identity and nature was not understood. It was discovered towards end of last year_Ñés work as a circle. It reappeared after cleaning and drying the trench, but our tests showed no distinction between inside the circle area and the outside of it. Only the circle line was clearly visible. We left this feature a little lower than the outside (585.80m) before we stopped working in this trench on June 4th at the depth of 585.84 meter.     ,~: D-9-2005-06-010-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 9,"1286,2005-06-11," C-1-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1102,","   Daily Trench    Area C   Trench 1   11 June 2005      Today we are continuing with cleaning and looking for good contexts. There was a small bit of L1102 (cleaning locus) left by the stair in the southwest corner of the trench. That is being cleaned up and removed. Also we are removing the short wall in the northeast of the trench (L1106) since it was floating. Then we will continue taking down the eastern section as cleaning locus 1107.      In the removal of L1102 we found a nice profile sherd with a small rim and carination as well as incised decoration resembling a simple straight line topped by a wavy line. Andy says this looks like a typical 2nd/3rd millennium cooking pot and the design looks like a lot of pottery found in the Urfa/Syria region. So the pottery seems to be consistent with the carbon date from the 2003 season.      We removed the short wall (L1106) in the northeast baulk of the trench, since it appeared to be floating. While it does not appear to continue down vertically, it does appear to continue back into the baulk to at least one more course. Two large cobbles removed from this short wall were reused door sockets.      In the removal of the arbitrary cleaning locus (L1107) a circular pit (?) covered with pottery stone and a white plaster was uncovered. There appears to be a surface leading away from it. There are also some random mud bricks. Below what was thought to have been a mud brick foundation to a stone wall (L1069) now appears to be a possible two-course wall cutting through the southeast corner of the trench. A good part of this was removed as L1105, but it continues at least in part of the locus. Tomorrow I will see if I can trace the wall on the east side, to see if it is separate from the \platform\ earlier hypothesized.     ,~: C-1-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1/Locus 1102,"1287,2005-06-11," D-10-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 10/Locus 1,","   Kenantepe 2005Page 1   Trench: D.10   Date: June 11, 2005         We worked with two workers and we paid attention to find the bottom of the pit L.11. It became clear that this pit was partially cut into pit/wall L.3 in the NW. Bottom of the pit L.11 has not been found today and the dumped bricks are still found inside at 586.93 meter. Tomorrow, we will continue excavating this pit until the bottom of it is reached. In the SW corner of the pit there is a group of pebbles going into the W section. According to this section, those rocks continue towards N and maybe meeting with pit L.3.      Today, we also began removing the N baulk to find the N wall of the room L.7. Some mud-bricks began appearing in the W side of the baulk, but they disappear in the E side. Hopefully, those bricks will continue further E and make the N wall of the room. The plaster line found at the bottom of the baulk seems to confirm this idea. The pit L.3 may be earlier, since the mud-bricks in the baulk are on top of it. If the room L.7 really associated with these brick in the N baulk, then the room becomes later than the pit. For the moment this explanation is not convincing because the L.3 seem to be cutting into the W wall L.10 of the room. Perhaps, what we have in the baulk is not really belong to room L.7 and it may belong to some other architecture that was later than the room L.7. Pit L.3 may also be dated to the II. Millennium layers that was cut into Ubaid in a diagonal way towards E adjusting the possible slope of the mound. The painted sherd we found inside of the pit may be accidental and the pottery bags from this pit have not been studied yet. The major problem with these assumptions is the limited exposures of the features and the weak quality of preservation. Probably, trench D.6 will provide secure answers to the stratigraphic issues and the position of the pit L.3, room L.7 and the N wall of the room.     ,~: D-10-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 10/Locus 1,"1288,2005-06-11," F-21-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21/Locus 6,","   Daily Trench    Area F   Trench 21   June 11, 2005   J. Nijhowne         We began the day by finishing the excavation of the child burial. We carefully screened the matrix around the bones using small meshed round screens. By doing this we recovered many teeth as well as other bone fragments. We also took another soil sample, KT10. We screened the sample onto large sacks so we could remove bone fragments but not contaminate the matrix. This matrix appeared to have a lot of ash mixed into it. No artifacts of any kind were found. There was a flat sherd right at the base of the pit and a flat piece of bone was sitting directly on it. It may have been part of the skull. We cleaned the pit for photos and took elevations. The pit had been cut through cultural levels and into virgin soil.   Since the purpose of this trench was to uncover the surface in the east baulk of F6, it was disappointing to have a huge pit cut right through it. Since no clear surface could be discerned in the pit profile, I decided to mark out a 1x1 meter square in the area most likely to contain the floor. I did this by having my workers stand in F6 at the north and south end of the surface. That way I could easily see where the surface was most likely to extend into F21, see plan view. We marked out a 1x1 meter square with nails and string and I called this locus 8 and the remainder of the trench locus 7. We started excavating locus 8 carefully with hand picks. All we found was dirt with some gravel, small stones, and cobbles but nothing that remotely looked like a living surface. The stones did not form a continuous surface and looked like they were spread randomly across the square. We paid close attention to elevations but still couldn_Ñét find it.     ,~: F-21-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21/Locus 6,"1289,2005-06-11," F-19-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19/Locus 9,","   Daily Trench    Area F, Trench 19   June 11, 2005   M. Baldi      Our big project today involved dealing with the collapsed brick. These collapses, possibly from at least two different walls, one falling north to south, the other from the opposite direction, were jumbled up and difficult to read. We knew they were there, especially on the southern half of the trench where the western baulk showed them clearly. We will try to better identify the extend of the burn and large ash layer located on the nearby trenches. The wall we located on the south end of the surface is about .50 meters off of the south baulk, this needs to be defined better, but I assigned to it Locus # 10.    Most of the brick on the southern half of the trench were popped up but little pottery and/or bone were collected off of the surface. A small piece of carbonized wood was collected under a layer of plaster of an up side down brick (L 9 KT # 9) at 568 meters elevation.   High winds and dust made cleaning for photos difficult. The north half of the trench requires more work in properly identifying and/or locating features on that side. As we have excavated we came upon this mass of bricks, which correspondingly points to walls that collapsed for some unknown reason. The brick was obviously decorated with a plaster material somewhat yellowish in color but was possibly white at some earlier time and has decayed by fire action and time to the current color. As we continue to work on this tomorrow I will add to these notes at that time.      ,~: F-19-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19/Locus 9,"1290,2005-06-11," F-21-2005-06-11-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Week 4   Area F   Trench 21   June 11, 2005   J. Nijhowne      We returned to work on this trench on Monday June 6. since there was no apparent features other than the wall locus 1, we decided to take the trench down in 25 cm arbitrary loci. Our goal was to quickly remove the overlying matrix to within 50 cm of the floor found in the eastern baulk of F6. The first arbitrary locus was locus 2. This matrix is hard and compact. Visible on the surface at this point was an intact base sherd. We excavated it first so we wouldn_Ñét break it by walking on it. As we worked around it, it became apparent it was a whole vessel and when we turned it over, another whole vessel was inside it. We proceeded to excavate locus 2 with big picks, leveled the trench and then took off the next arbitrary locus, locus 3. Again this was done with picks. At the bottom of locus 3 we found a surface, locus 4. It was not clear whether it was associated with the wall, locus 1. We removed the wall and it was clear that the floor did not go underneath the wall but was associated with the wall.    After we removed the floor we did two more large pick passes to remove the next arbitrary locus, locus 5. We discovered a large, sandy area in the middle of the trench which turned out to be a circular pit, locus 6. In the pit which we excavated with trowels, we found a large broken pot lying on its side. At the base of it was a skeleton probably of a small child. We covered the matrix so it could be fine screened at the beginning of next week.      ,~: F-21-2005-06-11-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21,"1291,2005-06-11," E-2-2005-06-11 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   June 11th, 2005   J. Henecke      Today we brought the entire trench down to the level of the initial sounding (L45). We finished removing L104, and determined that the color differences were elements within fill, rather than a wall or pit. We also removed L90, which seems to also have been merely fill of gray clay with carbon and white chalk inclusions. The cluster of medium and small stones and lithics (L106) beneath this locus was confined to a very small area but abutted the small L92 stone wall. After removing this wall, it became clear that the remains of mudbrick _ÑÐ possibly mudbrick slump _ÑÐ rested beneath. Tomorrow, after cleaning this area, I hope to find out whether the mudbrciks in the eastern corner appear here. We finished excavating L101, which was filled with decorated Ubaid sherds and the mudbricks to the south are now more clearly visible. Upon initial inspection, there seemed to be a mudbrick wall spanning the trench from east to west, and that the bricks in each half are in fact from the same structure. We aslo levelled L103, mixed fill, which produced few ceramics at this elevation. The ash pit L105, is now circular in shap and extends into the southeastern baulk.

Vidar      Trench F9 is located in Area F adjoining the 10x10 - Trench F7. The size of F9 itself was 4.35 x 4.65. This trench had been previously excavated, however it had not been touched since the 2001 season. The opening elevation for this season was between 569.01 and 567.98 taking into account the previously dug sounding in the eastern portion of the trench. The closing elevation for the trench was 567.7 and 566.35 _ÑÐ again taking into account both the main portion of trench and a deeper sounding.      I began with Loci L9023 _ÑÐ L9027 which were assigned to separate the previous levels of the trench into their own loci. When I felt like I got past the level of fill that had been redeposited in the trench since 2001, I renamed L9023 to L9029. L9028 was a locus in which I cut back the side of the 2001 sounding to see what we could tell about the next half a meter of the trench. Once I brought L9025 down to the level of 9026, I renamed the locus L9031. L9029 was temporarily divided into two loci but later merged back into one _ÑÐ L9032. L9033 and 9034 can both be disregarded, as I later realized that L9027 had not been brought down to the levels of 2001 and the former loci were just redeposited soil.      L9030 is the first important locus. It was the corner of a pit located in L9029/9032. I later realized, after taking L9029 down to the proper level, that the pit continued at this level. I later took L9030 down and renamed the whole pit L9045. This pit coincides with the pit in F7 on the other side of the baulk. It should also be noted that I took this pit down a little too low on the W side and the actual stopping point would have been more in line with the other side of the pit in F7.      L9035 was a wall that wrapped around L9032 and L9039 (a later locus # for the same L9032 region). The fill at the end of the wall in the SW corner eventually became L9040 and L9041 as I defined the wall with Bradley. The only associated surface might have been the pebble surface L9036 but the majority of this surface was blown through and I_Ñém not positive if it went all the way to this wall. I took a HAP sample of this surface and renamed the actual 50cm x 50cm sample L9037. The only thing the surface really revealed was a bronze needle.      On the western edge of F9 we found an ashy region _ÑÐ L9038. I actually thin this might have been some type of moving fireplace, as the thin ash layer can be seen jumping around within close proximity in the baulk.      I then went through a period of relatively nothing in the trench and renamed _ of the trench L9043. The L9027 locus was renamed L9044 once I had determined that I was past the backfill of the 2001 season. Once I had brought the whole trench down to one level, I renamed the majority of the trench into on locus _ÑÐ L9047.      L9042 was a burial in the SW corner of the trench but it was very poorly preserved and not much remains of it but photographs. It was an adult body _ÑÐ face down. The skull was smashed and half of the body was in the baulk so I only was able to get what I could.      From this point, my trench began to get interesting. L9046 developed in a locus containing a plaster surface (L9051) and a doorpost and threshold entrance to a large room with a packed mud surface. The supra surface fill L9048 was filled with layers of white pseudo morph imprints from what appeared to be grass and reeds. The L9049 surface itself turned out to be packed mud but was also covered by a layer of the white pseudo morph material. The subsurface was L9053. This room was surrounded on the visible sides by the wall L9052 _ÑÐ a wall of pisÕó© and mud brick construction. The pisÕó© row was closest to the L9049 surface with portions of the surface fused to it. The type of construction is why I originally had difficulty defining it and hence left it all a part of the L9050 Locus. This whole room was cut by the previously mention L9045 pit. However, at the level of the surface, there was a burn line that appeared as though it might have been an earlier, smaller pit actually associated with the L9049 surface. Whoever continues in F7 should watch for this as they are going down. Under the L9049 surface, there turned out to be a large pit over a meter deep (L9055). This explains why the part of the L9049 surface directly above was sinking as much as it was.      After digging the L9055 pit, we decided to turn the sides into a square and push down until we hit virgin soil. This would give us an idea of what to expect in the trench via the 4 sections, as well as how long it would be until we hit the bottom. The sections ended up not revealing much of anything and as a result we closed the trench.       The sections of the baulk don_Ñét show much more than layer after layer of ash and fill. The North section shows in great detail the effect of the L9045 pit on the later layers above it. All the layers sink into this large pit.      For the most part, we believed that F9 was centered on a courtyard or other outside area throughout most of the levels. This is supported by the pebble surface L9036 and the nonexistent architecture in the sections of L9056. The structure that consisted of the white pseudo morph most likely was used as organic material storage, and we believe that it could have been part of a barn area. This is also supported by greenish material surrounding the structure, which might be a sign of animal pens.      The presence of multiple large pits could contribute to the idea that the area was primarily used as a work area.      This Trench has no exposed features that are waiting to be excavated. If anyone takes over the trench in the future, I would suggest that they just focus on pushing down to see if anything is revealed that does not appear in the sections of L9056     ,~: F-9-2005-06-12-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 9,"1297,2005-06-12," E-2-2005-06-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,","   Daily    Area E, Trench 2   June 12th, 2005   J. Henecke      Today I closed all loci expect 82, 105 and 45. The trench is now level with the sounding, and I began by cleaning, using the sprayer and assigning new loci. We were able to discern two sections of mudbrick wall (L116 and 114), which may be part of the same structure. Between these walls are a series of pits (L113 and 115). Within L115, there are mudbricks, which may belong to the L116/114 group. It is unclear whether the bricks lie within or above the pit. To the north of these walls, the soil has a gray color and may be the interior of the structure (L107, 111).       I removed L45, which was a few centimeters of ed soil, and once removed L108 is a locus (L108) or fresh soil. Beneath the soil, we began to uncover a white plaster floor with a few pottery gragments and pebbles (L118) near the mudbrick wall (L116). I articulated wall L116, removing the fill surrounding it (L90).      It is difficult to tell whether L113 is a true pit. We chipped off the soil and discovered what appears to be a surface, but it only extends to the southwest for a short distance, and it is slated at a steep angle into the soil. There is a clear line _ÑÐ greenish in color _ÑÐ where this possible surface lies, but it is very difficult to trace its shape beyond this. To the wouthwest the loci becomes more likely a pit, with softer soil and organi pseudomorph. In general, the soil in this locus is unusually hard for a pit. In L110, 112 and 107, I levelled the surface and am preparing to dig down to reveal existing features. We also found a stone wall emerging from pit L105.     ,~: E-2-2005-06-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 45,"1298,2005-06-12," F-19-2005-06-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19/Locus 9,","   Daily Trench    Area F, Trench 19   June 12, 2005   M. Baldi      Today we will define the wall area on the south end of the trench (L 10) giving special attention with any relationship with the burned surface or thick ash layer. This is slow trowel work but it will help us answer questions relating to the relationship these brick may have had with the surface. Contemporaneity, extend, and usage will give us clues to the standing questions regarding the area F trenches situated in the lower town. By the floor and wall signatures it can be advanced that the floor will cover most of the trench. Admittedly the walls themselves are not as of yet completely defined, and the mess of collapsed bricks is difficult to clarify. We have followed the area of bricks with burned plaster as a way to tell where the bricks have fallen. These collapsed bricks are found at different levels and on top of each other, especially in the middle area of the trench were if as I thought earlier they may have fallen against each other from two different directions. This plaster as mentioned before is about .01 meter in thickness and may have been applied to the wall after several layers of plain mud. The plastered side of the brick faces down against either a surface or against other bricks. The yellowed wafer thin material reads at 10 YR 7/2. The reverse side of the brick has a layer of some burned material, and is black in color. My guess by looking at it is that it is the same plaster material, but found on those bricks which faced the intense fire as they fell. The problem with this theory is that the black burned material is fairly uniform throughout the trench, and with some exceptions at a fairly leveled surface. I will need to better identify the extend of these items and establish better relationships between them.      ,~: F-19-2005-06-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19/Locus 9,"1299,2005-06-12," F-7-2005-06-12-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Area F, Trench 7   C. Painter      Week 4         This week_Ñés major work was confined to the recording and excavation of several surfaces in the northwest corner of the trench as well as the uncovering of a large mud brick structure. First several surfaces, specifically L7168, 7174, 7179, 7182, 7185, 7189 were excavated from either side of walls 7163 and 7154.

Each HAP sample for each surface was taken from the same spot so that there will be continuity. In each case, it was noted both in the baulk sections, the sections from walls 7163 and 7154, and in the sections of pieces from the actual surfaces themselves that each locus contained multiple superimposed layers that were on average 2-3mm in thickness and spaced by no more than 1cm.       Also this week walls 7158 and 7160 were finally removed. It was found that below these walls and subwall fill, which was not very deep, was an additional series of walls that eventually gave way to an entire \structure\ that was composed of 4-5 mud brick walls interconnected by right angle corners to form two small \magazine-type\ interior spaces.

We plan to do so the because we can see bricks in the baulk which disappear at an angle into the baulk. Another idea is to finish removing the eastern baulk and make the trench rectanglulas once again. One reason for doing this is to help articulate the outside edge of wall L76.    We also are continuing to bring down the fill areas. This includes L91, L88 and L78. At the end of the day we found some flat lying pot sherds in L78 which indicated the prescence of a floor. The floor is most likely soil with pottery in it and so will be very hard to trace. Also when we were bringing down L78 we found an odd _ÑÉS_Ñé- shape configuration of stones. They are lined up single file and make a squished S shape. Some of the stones disappear under L81 which means that they are not contemporanious. These rocks are up against wall L75 and appear to be placed against the wall. We will not know more about this until L81 is removed.    In L91 we pulled out a complete shell bead as we took the fill down 5cm.      ,~: D-8-2005-06-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 70,"1302,2005-06-12," D-6-2005-06-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 58,","   Daily    Area D, Trench 6   June 12, 2005   Baris UZEL          First of all, we found the mudbrick wall L60, the big rocks wall L61, other the mudbrick wall L62 and the fill area L63 final of the yesterday.

It had last been excavated in August 2002 before being opened again on June 7, 2005. The first locus for this year 2163 was dug by Marie Marlee. I took over today in locus 2164. I only had one workman. The first thing I did was to measure the bottom of the 1 x 1. In reality, it was closer to 80 x 80 cm. We straightened the baulks and took an opening elevation, 595.64. It coincided with the elevation Marie ended with. We_Ñére digging down in 25 cm arbitrary levels. To make save time taking elevations mid level, I had the workmen push a nail into the baulk at the top of the locus. That was it was possible to take approximate vertical levels as we went down off the nail without constantly going back to the transit. The system worked very well.    The matrix is quite moist and sticks to the tools. This is probably due to the recent rains. Part way through 2164, we came on a mud brick wall. Some sherds were lying at the same level. I drew a top plan of the wall, took an elevation, and some photographs before continuing down. Locus 2165 is similar to 2164. It is very damp and contains lots of ash. There is an approximately 10 cm wide band of ash along the northern baulk. There is not a lot of pottery or bone.    *Note: I was assigned this trench in the field so could not check the next locus number in the sequence. Since Marie had already dug one locus in the 1x1 this season, I gave my locus the arbitrary number of 2 which equals 2164. 2165 is actually locus 3. I had planned to change the tags on the bags but they got sorted before I had the chance.

The red bricky material extends through most of this wall with a light color section (perhaps signifying a wall) on the very southeast corner. I think I have noted elsewhere that this is being left over for now to be looked at as we take the trench down. I have given this area Locus # 6.   There are 2 possible walls on the center and south half of the trench and as I have not worked on these I have not given them a locus number yet.   There is a small area between these 2 possible walls that contain about 7 bricks that appear to be standing on their side, at this point they don_Ñét appear to be associated with anything.   To the west of the westernmost wall like feature, is an area of small pebble as of yet undetermined as to what it is. I would guess that rain runoff carried this material to rest against the wall.   On the east end of the trench we will down to the ash layer and look at the section from there. The original plan was to big pick a small area off of the east end but by the end of the day we managed to lower this over a greater area than planned.

Vidar      I started D10 in the afternoon on the 13 after Bakir left. I began by having one guy take down the L14 wall to try and get down to L17. While he was doing that, I began looking around the walls of pit L11. What we originally thought was the NE corner of Room L7 actually turned out to be another mud brick row. When I looked on the south side of the pit, I scraped the side back until I found the edge of the wall L10. Abutting the wall on the E side is a clear line of red mud brick going about 7 cm down followed by 1 cm of black ash/mortar. This line of red mud brick slopes up wrapping around a quarter of the pit until the slope itself takes it out and hence making it invisible on the east edge. The NE corner however is higher than where the sloping line ends on the east side of the pit and I therefore believe that the mud brick we found in this corner is all part of one surface. The L7 room might actually be more of a mud brick platform associated with the L10 wall.      Lower down in the pit, another sloping black layer can be seen following the same slope as the higher one. This other layer is about 22cm below the mud brick layer. It appears to be in line with the L15 surface, which makes me believe that the thin layer of white directly above the black might be the continuation of this plaster.      Also, this second layer is in line with where the wall L10 appears to bottom out. This is about 26cm down from the top of the pit on the S side.     ,~: D-10-2005-06-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 10/Locus 7,"1309,2005-06-13," F-2-2005-06-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2029,","   Daily    Area F, Trench 2   June 13, 2005   Melissa Eppihimer      After redrawing the fill under wall 2034 (L2039) on the new trench plan size, the workers removed it.

We decided to take down the E half of the trench 20 cm. This is L2040. When this was scraped at the end of the day, some new features were defined. Running N-S parallel in orientation to wall 2034 is a 1 cm thick line of plaster layers. Immediately to its E is a 3-4 cm segment of gray soil and then the rest is red/orange bricky material. A large amorphous ashy pit with brick debris inside cuts this and another red/orange brick area, itself including a more gray section. In the S, linear borders are hard to observe, unlike the N.

Baldi      Continuing with the notes from yesterday we will remove the layer of burned material about 10 centimeters to look for the wall context and a possible surface where all of these bricks may be laying on. I tried to show with the first 3 photos taken today a good visual of the thin burned material and its color.   After some discussion with Andy and Bradley, we opted to cut back the baulks of of F 1 to help us identify the brick and or wall more easily. Once this was completed we were better able to see once again the collapsed brick. Following this project, our intention and start was towards working on the brick to identify the next area of context. A surface began appearing near the southwest area of the trench littered with lots of pottery, and with excellent diagnostics probabilities. For better material control this surface was designated Locus 12 and we began collecting only those sherds displaced during the excavating, everything else was left in-situ.

Today I am trying to understand a bit of what is happening in my trench. So when cleaning up the back, raised, mud brick portion, the center ended up being soft and forming a sort of oven shape, but there wasn_Ñét much if any ash. So I took a photo of the shape and removed it. That leaves us with the two mud brick stubs and the surface between them. The mud brick stubs are directly below the stone walls removed during the 2002 and 2003 field seasons. Bradley, Andy and I think that the mud brick walls were the pre-existing architectural features. Then later the stone walls were added to preexisting architecture. The surface seems to fit nicely between them. So tomorrow I will take an HAP sample of the surface.

Andy observed bricks/bricky spread in the N edge of 8032, but this is not yet defined. Perhaps associated with it is a layer of pebbles, perhaps a deposit rather than a surface.

Baldi      The surface located yesterday was continued today, and we began preparing it for photos and for a later sampling using the Household Archaeology Protocol. It is clear that this surface is much larger than we previously thought. In our search for its extend we continue removing areas of collapsed brick; among them was the collapsed brick on the north end of the trench next to the northwest corner. After finding and articulating this brick I revised my earlier idea of tow walls falling against each other. The almost orderly way in which these brick in the northwest quadrant fell is reminiscent of waves. I am going to propose that the brick nearer the bottom of a surface would normally fall close by and in succession, those bricks higher up would then to compress the lower bricks against their original point of origin. If this holds up then the new theory is that a wall near the southern edge of the trench fell towards the north and by its force caused a second wall there to topple also in a northerly direction. In any case, we did not find the current surface (Locus 12) under these bricks adding some validity that here stood a separate wall which also fell. But it is unclear if the walls fell consecutively or if they are from different periods.    Our work on the southern end of the trench helped us in better identifying and confirming a wall about .3 meters off of the current south end of the trench. This work will help us in better identifying the direction of the wall and how it fell. The smaller areas of surface uncovered were small and towards the eastern edge of the trench and appeared to closely follow similar contours as those of the brick collapse.   Loci will need to be better defined, and described before we can move any further.      ,~: F-19-2005-06-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19/Locus 10,"1316,2005-06-14," F-22-2005-06-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 22/Locus 5,","   Kenan Tepe   Area F    Trench 22   Andy Creekmore   Tuesday June 14 2005      NOTE: THERE IS A SECOND, _ÑÉB_Ñé DAY PLAN FOR THIS DAY, CONTAINING A SKETCH OF THE BURIAL L6.       Today I reopened F22 where Marco left off a few weeks ago. I cleaned the trench, cut the north section and worked on a burial, L6, found lodged in the north section (the south section of old trench F1). I attempted to articulate the partially exposed bones and define the area of the pit. The pit seems to stretch for several meters along the F22 north baulk. I removed several bones from two concentrations, one to the west and another to the east. It appears to be the remains of two people that have been disturbed. Several leg bones appear about 50cm east of a concentration of upper body bones and a maxilla. A bronze (?) pin was found near the leg bones but is likely dislocated from its original position, which must have been near the shoulders of the original burial. During its recovery we bent the tip of the pin (L6, KT1). It has a ball head, is pierced below the head, and has a considerable weight. Many more bones remain in the ground to be extracted in coming days.

This locus was cut on the south side by a pit removed in 2003 (L1100 and 1086).      The _ m2 HAP sample area was removed resulting in the collection of 2.5 buckets at 9 liters each totaling 22.5 liters.      The floor volume of the sample was an additional 16.5 buckets at 9 liters each totaling 148.5 liters.      So the idea is that L1111/1089 and L1110/1083 were mud brick walls with the associated surface L1109 (plastered surface). It is unclear if this was the original surface or not. The mud brick may or may not continue down below this. The mud brick walls probably extended up approximately 30-35cm (after reuse) and was then reused as a foundation for the stone walls. About 15-20cm above the current level in the 2003 field season there was a small secondary wall (L1092) and an associated fire installation (L1098?). There was also an in situ pot smash (KT?) lying against the wall (L1089). So the walls were reused over time through multiple phases.

Baldi      Today I subdivided the trench into several loci to better account for materials and to define as well as to divide work in the various areas. The area enclosed by the rounded wall and the wall itself at the nortwest corner was assigned Locus # 13, this wall may actually be part of a well_Ñés lining and the corner fill may be counted as part of the contents of that pit. We have little of this feature inside the area of the trench to be able to define this at this time. The open fill area next to this wall was labeled Locus # 10, while the open fill area on the opposite side (south end) of the pit (L 8) was labeled Locus # 9. These two may be very well the same, we may find later that they are separated by features. The pit already excavated is Locus # 8. The ash layer on the east end is Locus # 13. In order of East to West the large semi wall feature next to the south baulk and that I have not worked on much is Locus # 6. This definitely needs to be consolidated as such or removed. East of the ash layer is a wide wall with a nice burnt brick signature on the north baulk which I have called Locus # 11. Closer to the west end is another wall numbered as Locus # 12. There is also the possibility of yet anotehr wall btween the two walls L 11 and L 12. Additionally there are some bricks just barely showing up on the surface between the walls just mentioned.

Vidar      As we began going down in the l14 wall, the progression of construction began to become clearer. Our running theory right now is a three phase construction. The first phase included the wall L10 which was part of a cell plan room associated with the surface L. 15 which we can see at the base of the wall in the pit L11 and continuing on the outside of L9. The wall L12 was also there at this time. The second phase was the sealing in of the cell block room with mud brick at the higher level (L7). On the west side of L10, the L16 surface was also added at this time and appears to continue to the base of L3. L3 was then actually a piling of rocks in a third phase on the continuation of the L16 surface and leaning up against the L10 wall. The L14 wall was most likely added during the second phase as the cell block room was filled in. We know that this was not just a later building all together because of the use of the shared walls _ÑÐ L10, L12, and L9.       Support for the idea that L3 was not a pit, but actually a pile of rocks and sherds against a wall can be seen on Bakir_Ñés day plans from June 7th and 8th, in which he details the original rocks abutting flat against mud brick.     ,~: D-10-2005-06-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 10/Locus 7,"1320,2005-06-14," F-8-2005-06-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 8/Locus 8030,","   Daily Summary   Area F, Trench 8   June 14, 2005   M.

The bricky area in the N is still difficult to articulate in plan but in section it is a clearly sloping line downhill from the E to W. It is densely bricky, but courses are not clear so its status remains unclear.       The plan is to go down on either side of 8034 far enough to find its bottom (which is now clear in some spots on the W side), remove the fill in the doorway, and then take out the wall. That way the N end may become clearer in 8036.      The bottom of the wall 8034 was found on the side of 8031, so we went ahead and removed the soil in the doorway. It was full of large potsherds and stones up to 15 cm, but no surfaces.

Nijhowne      Introduction   Trench F21 is located on the southern edge of the tepe approximately half way between the upper tell and the river. It lies approximately 60 cm east of F6. F21 expanded south as we excavated. Its final dimensions were 2.64 m x 4.25 m. We laid out this trench for the sole purpose of coming down on the surface seen in the east baulk of F6. This surface is composed of rocks and gravel but was cut through when the original test trench F6 was expanded. Our intention was to big pick our way through the matrix to within 50 cm or so of the surface and then start excavating. For this reason, opening elevations were not taken.       Excavation Summary   After the workman opened the trench using large picks, they came across a wall comprised of conglomerate stones. We changed our original plans and decided to level the trench and start recording our finds. I designated the wall locus 1. Its highest point is 570.46 m. The matrix around the wall contained no discernible features so it became locus 2, highest point 570.40. Because of the lack of features, we chose to excavate in arbitrary levels of 25 cm each. Before beginning the first large pick pass for locus 2, we removed what we thought was going to be a well-preserved base sherd at the southern end of the trench. It turned out to be a whole pot with another whole pot inside, KT3 (larger pot) and KT4 (smaller pot). We excavated locus 2 and 3 with large picks. Both abutted the wall locus 1. In locus 3 we found half a fish net weight.   As we completed locus 3, we found a surface, locus 4, which lay just east of the wall locus 1. At this point, we could not determine whether the surface and the wall were associated or not. For that reason, we decided to disassemble the wall. It appeared that the wall ended somewhere above the floor because the lowest stones had been pedestaled to keep them in place. We removed the matrix between the upper stones with trowels and the first course of stones. More stones lay underneath. These had been hidden by the matrix left as pedestals. Apparently the pedestaled stones were ones that had slipped off the wall. The stones continued down to within 15 cm of the floor. There we found a base of very compact earth on the west side of the wall and a mix of small stones and gravel on the east side. We leveled this but the stones and gravel layer went deeper than the floor. We stopped, removed the floor with small picks and trowels, and then finished locus 1. The small stones ended 3 cm below the floor.   With wall locus 1 and the floor locus 4 removed, we again had a featureless trench which became locus 5. We did two big pick passes to complete the arbitrary level. In this locus we found a broken spindle whorl, part of grinding stone and part of a fish net weight. When we finished, we discovered an area of very soft sand in the center of the trench. We defined the boundaries of this pit locus 6 with trowels. We took a soil sample KT 5 from the top and screened 1 bucket of matrix in the big screen to see if we were missing anything. We weren_Ñét. Soon we came across large pieces of pottery that obviously belonged to the same pot. We set these aside to be bagged separately. The sherds are KT6 and KT7 as we collected them over two days. Towards the bottom, we came across pieces of bones. As we suspected this might be a burial, we were on the look out for them. We started putting the matrix through fine meshed screens. As a result, we collected a quantity of human bone including many teeth. They appear to be the bones of a young child. Right at the bottom of the pit, a flat piece of bone lay directly on a large sherd. We collected an additional soil sample KT10 as it appeared ashy at the bottom of the pit but we screened it first to remove any human bone. There were no artifacts associated with the burial and we excavated the pit as a single unit. The top of the pit was at an elevation of 569.60 and the bottom 569.04. The bottom was cut into virgin soil.   No apparent surface or floor was visible in the pit profile. Since the whole raison d_Ñéetre for this trench was to excavate the floor with the aim of taking a HAP sample, I decided to lay out a 1x1 m square in F21 that had the best chance of having a preserved surface. To do this, I had two workmen stand in F6 next to its eastern baulk at the north and south ends of the surface in profile that was most easily seen. I laid out the 1x1 against F21_Ñés western baulk starting at 2 meters south of the north baulk and ending 3 meters south of the north baulk. I named the 1x1 locus 8 and the remainder of the trench locus 7. Again, these are arbitrary loci. In locus 8, I started at 569.65 and ended at 569.48. According to the elevations, we should have been on top of the surface but couldn_Ñét find anything definite. We decided to take the entire trench down to 569.48 which we did with a big pick pass. For this reason, I combined locus 7 and locus 8 on the locus sheets. We reset the 1x1 in its original spot and tried again. This is locus 9. The intention was to find a surface we could follow beyond the 1x1. We took locus 9 down to 569.41 which means we should have been through the floor. We did find stones and some gravel but absolutely nothing appeared that remotely made a convincing living surface. We decided to expand locus 9 out the way we had with locus 8. As the workman small picked their way north, they hit virgin soil so we stopped. We set the original 1x1 up again and named it locus 10. We took it down to virgin soil at 569.31. No surface was found so we abandoned the trench.       Interpretation   The conglomerate wall locus 1 and the floor locus 4 are definitely associated. The floor did not continue under the wall since the rock/gravel foundation went below the level of the floor. The child pot burial locus 6 appears to be earlier than the wall and floor since the top of the pit lies approximately 20 cm below the floor.. The top of the pit was so soft, it is unlikely that we cut through it without noticing. But the whole purpose of the trench was to come down on the surface seen in the east profile of F6. In F6, the surface appeared substantial but when we came down on top of it, no continuous surface of any kind was apparent. Yes, we did find rocks and gravel so I am quite sure the layer does extend into F21 from F6 and does not end in the baulk. But I am not convinced that it is a cultural layer. We did not find flattened sherds or bones that could have been stomped into a living surface. It lies directly on virgin soil and could be the result of natural geological processes.         ,~: F-21-2005-06-15-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 21,"1325,2005-06-15," E-2-2005-06-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 105,","   Daily     Area E, Trench 2   June 15th, 2005      The trench is currently dominated by two areas. L116, 120 and 119 form a possible street feature, while L118 is an associated floor surface on the northern side of L116/114. Secondly, the southern half of the trench is dominated by pit infested pested mixed fill.       I excavated pit L124, which cuts L114 and L116, and at the bottom of this pit is a section of wall, similar to as at the bottom of L115. This pit was filled with ashy soil with burnt pottery and bones. There was also a thin white line of pseudomorph residue, possibly a remnant of grain storage.       I closed L110, and opened L129 as the fill locus next to the L122 pebbled surface. I discovered a small pit, extending into the southwestern baulk, that cuts across both L122 and 129. It contained little cultural material. I took a 9 L HAP sample (L125) from the L122 surface and plan on removing the entire surface tomorrow. I believe that I have reached the bottom of the L119 stone wall, and I hope to remove it tomorrow in order to determine whether there is any connection with a possible street surface in L120.       I excavated another 10 cm in L120 in an attempt to find the end of L116. I was unsuccessful at both finding the bottom of this wall and at discovering any concrete evidence for a surface. It is possible that the street between these two walls was more of a packed interface, and we did find a more dense accumulation of pebbles along L116. At the same time, I excavated in L112, but the locus continues to be mixed fill without correlating contexts.       Near the end of the day, there was a sandstorm on the tepe, and I was only able to take a 9 L HAP sample from L118 instead of excavating the whole surface. I did clean the surface throughout the day, and tomorrow I will be prepared for its removal.     ,~: E-2-2005-06-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 105,"1326,2005-06-15," D-8-2005-06-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 70,","   Daily trench Summary   Area D   Trench 8   June 15, 2005   E.O.      This big project for today was to remove part of the western baulk to see if we can trace wall L65/L73 into the baulk until it meets L77. To do this we took out a section of the western baulk 1.5m wide and 60 cm deep. They started by taking down the top have of the baulk the full 60 cm deep. As we did this we were able to see a large rock surface that Barish up in D6 will probably find. I simply took out this fill as topsoil and did not save or bag anything from it. Once we were within 20 cm of where I could see the bricks starting I started fill locus 96 for all the fill around the wall and we stopped digging with big pick and switched to the small picks. Once we hit the top of a brick we stopped digging down from the top and started digging from the side (from the east headed into the west baulk). I had them dig this in at and angle which is drew in based on what I new about the trajectory of the wall. I went slightly inside where I thought it should go simply because I wanted to actually catch the edges of the bricks.    While two guys were working on this I kept going down in question areas. One of these was L91. One reason why this needed to come down was so that we could articulate the outer edge of wall 70 which we found there. This section of wall L70 is particularly important because it connects the main set of walls (L70, 71, and 72) to the bricks of L84.   This workday was cut short by the gale force winds that rocketed the trench. The original hand written day plan was also lost to the wind. As of the end of this day we had not finished articulating the wall in the baulk, which is now L97.        ,~: D-8-2005-06-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 70,"1327,2005-06-15," F-2-2005-06-15 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2029,","   Daily Summary   Area F, Trench 2   June 15, 2005   Melissa Eppihimer      One worker started by taking down 2046 in the NW of the trench (the soil under the bricky layer 2038) to the level of 2043 in the rest of the trench.      Another continued in the pit, but the soil quickly shifted from a mottled soil to a more black soft ash. In this ash was found a number of child bones (toes and ankles). It is not yet clear if these bones are a disturbed burial, a burial poking through from outside the pit context, or another context completely. I_Ñéve stopped work until I can figure out what is going on.       After sweeping and spraying the whole trench, the different areas of orange, gray, and white soil were nearly impossible to convincingly define, so we decided to cut out 2 sections (65 by 20 cm and 50 by 20 cm) into the pit 2042 walls to try to catch the walls and any stratigraphy that can give us a window into the area.      In both of the sections the plaster line is very clear and runs down about one half meter until the soil changes in the pit section. At this lower level there is a plaster floor/surface (?). To the E of the plaster line in both sections is the red brick wall (2044). To the W is mottled fill (2043).

Also more carbon. The walls seem to continue down at least 5 cm. A few more mud bricks along L1110. Also a few in the center, but nothing too clear. The dirt in the fill seems to be pretty normal, not too hard or soft. Not too much pottery either. There was some sort of white chaffy material coming up in the dirt, partially flat lying, but it never flaked off nicely and Bradley thought there might be more in the matrix as opposed to some sort of old grain stash. We will see if that continues. We are trying to go down another 10-15cm to see about the extent of the walls.

There may be color differentiation towards the N between an ashy area and an orange area.      Next came the removal of wall 8034. The first course came off easily with 8 to 9 cm chunks. The second course was also clear, but more difficult because it is drier. The size of the bricks is an estimate and a guess because the wall was in such bad shape, pitted by animal holes and gaps, and because it was exposed so long that to scrape it would make it all fall apart. My estimate is 8 by 22 by 45 cm. They seemed to be staggered on top of each other.

Eppihimer      This morning we began by finishing yesterday_Ñés work in 2043. While the workers did this, I removed 2029, the mudbrick platform. The construction constisted of 3 rows and 3 courses of bricks. In the top course there were 2 burnt orange bricks. The rest were yellow and included chunks of white green and yellow clay. The bricks were 6 to 7 cm by 32 to 33 cm. The third dimension is unknown because the bricks are in the baulk. The pedestal of soil underneath is a mixed locus, L2047. This was removed.

I am having a worker dig down to the depth of this green line to see if it is a plaster floor, the pot of the wall, or something else. The northern edge of 2044 has been redefined because I spotted a vertical green plaster line in the E section of the pit 2042. This line is now the N border of 2044 so I_Ñém having the workers stop there.      After clearing 2044 some new interesting features emerged. In the SE corner there is a pebble surface (2049). Immediately abutting it to he W is a mudbrick wall that runs NE-SW and then turns at a corner to the W (2050). Along its western edge and including the W spur_Ñés N wall is a plaster line.

With the sandstorm yesterday this locus (2141) was not completed. So will finish it today and then move on to a new locus.      While finishing L2141 we came across a single course stone wall or demarcation of some sort. The wall runs on a roughly north-south axis through the center of the sounding. While scraping the dirt on either side of the wall (L2174) two green bricks were found. After studying the sections of the sounding, it looks like the low stone wall marked the boundary of a mud brick wall that survived to a height of approximately 80+cm. Alternating green, red and brown bricks. This appears to be similar in construction to one found in Ellie_Ñés trench (I), but no reeds were found between the courses. The stones were aligned in such a way as to form a relatively straight line to the west where they abutted the wall and are more jagged on the eastern side. Some of the cobbles were broken, perhaps to facilitate the construction or were chosen for this use because of their shape. There was also a bricky red dirt covering the cobbles. Perhaps in place to hold the smaller pebbles in place. We will bring down the fill on the eastern side and the bricks on the west to test the extent of the wall.

We used L8029 in the W part of the trench to go down further and succeeded in finding the wall again. The wall 8034 ran diagonally SW to NE across the trench. It had a doorway that was 1.1 m. wide near the center. The wall was preserved up to 2 courses high. The individual brick sizes were difficult to determine because it took the entire week before we could remove the wall so the material became dry and brittle. Also, the wall was pitted with animal holes. The fill in the doorway had pottery and rocks in it.      On either side of the wall was fill. To the W was 8032 and 8035, the latter containing a concentration of brick debris. As we came down in 8032 a concentration of pebbles increased so we changed the loci to 8036.

After three non work seasons at the trench, It needed a lot of cleaning. First of all, we were cleaning the trench and baulks. Then we took opening elevations and pictures. We started to excavate with new locus number 57.    During the second week of excavation, we focused pebble surfaces and places at the trench. In sequence, we found L58, L64 and L72 pebbles surface during the week. I believe they were street and people replaced the street couple time in 2nd millennium with pebble. We took HAP sample from L58 and L64 in the week. The surface L58 was from 2002 excavation season. We found the other pebble surface L64 under surface L58.   On the other hand, we found some structures east of L64 surface (street) area. L66 and L68 could be room and we found a door way (L67) with in situ door socket between these two rooms (L66-L68).

On the other hand we also revealed the sub-fill L21, by this way we have observed that a platform was beneath it. During the revealing process in L 19 (to the north- west portion of the locus) we observed slight grain impressions which were getting along with a broken piece of grinding stone. These make me think that we are revealing a storage room.      Besides that we also have removed L3 (the rocks which run through the west baulk) has been removed. After removing the rocks it turned out to be clear to me that the wall of L19 somehow goes together with L9 and it might get a turn to the west and then it may get along with L16. If this is true it can be said that the structure is a big cell planed structure and which has only one coarse of mud-brick wall which is marking its exterior side.       After we finished articulating L3, L19 and L21 Dr. Bradley Parker decided that we should take some overshoots so, that we will be able to observe the entire context in once before it will be gone.

Since the area required cleaning we decided to look at the area on the southeast side of the trench to better identify the end of the sub-floor. I decide to remove some of the dirt that was serving as sort of a baulk, something Bradley and I had discussed doing a few days ago to see what were the relationships of this area to the surfaces and walls. This work was catalogued as Locus 17 to maintain material separation, but I decided not to collect it until after reaching the original surface matrix. We did find that the surface did not continued east of the already marked location. We did collect a few sherds from the locus surface (one a nicely decorated sherd) equaling Locus 14 sitting by itself and not in any relation to L 14. Locus 17 looks at this time like it may be a wall. Of course it would make sense that if this is a wall (about 35 centimeters in width), that it would be a terminating wall and that it would abut the surface of L 14, but as mentioned, the potsherd and stone littered surface was not observed here.

Henecke      I began the day by excavating pit L127 in the north corner of the trench. It is a shallow ashy pit, and differences in soil coloration at the bottom may signal the presence of a feature at this level. I also extended pit L115 after finding a clear line on the southeastern side. The pit is now roughly oval, and there is evidence for more mudbricks -- possibly wall features _ÑÐ at the bottom. The excation of these pits suggests that mudbrick wall L114/116 extends deeper into the surface, and that there are features possibly associated with the wall at this level.      After removing L118, there seemed to be evidence for a second floor under the subsurface soil. I excavated several centimeters from the subsurface locus (L130), and beneath this sealed fill were flat lying pot sherds _ÑÐ Ubaid _ÑÐ and medium sized stones. Tomorrow, I will open a new locus for the surface and attempt to correlate it with the wall.       On June 15th, we seemed to have reached a pebbled surface in the the possible street locus (L120), but upon inspection, it seems as if this surface is either nonexistant or very poorly preserved. I closed locus L120 and opened L132 _ÑÐ taking a 3 L soil sample _ÑÐ in case we had in face found a surface at this level. After removing the locus, I sprayed the surface, and the lines of mudbrick walls were clearly visible. Tomorrow, I will assign new loci in this area, and attempt to figure out the orientation and relationships of these walls.       I combined the L119 and L122 subsurface into a single loci (L131), because the soil under both these features seemed very similar.

Baldi      After the good results while working on the east side of the trench, I decide to extend the trench further north in that area and we removed a couple of meters of fill from this area. Much of this dirt was out of context as it had been leveled there during the earlier cleanup phases. Our efforts were quickly rewarded as we continued locating what now appears as a much wider wall which in a small area still has bricks in place and with plaster still attached to them. This is I believe the first time that this well preserved bricks and plaster still in situ have been observed at the lower town areas of Kenan Tepe. This of course constitutes a puzzle as one would think that the floor of Locus 14 would be abutting this wall designated as Locus 18. But the lack of a continuing surface makes it unlikely. It should be noted that the surface abutting L 18 does appear to be plastered, but it was clean of materials. This riddle may be one that needs to be resolved next year. We needed to do the HAP on the sub-floor (Locus 15) a task that yielded 24.5 buckets of soil, equaling 220.5 liters of sieved soil. My next project was to reach and identify the nature of the large cobble stones observed at the south end of the trench just under the soil. The fill below Locus 15 was designated Locus 19 and collected accordingly, of course removing this fill required the removal of part of Locus , with the fill labeled as Locus 19 while the stones themselves were designated as Locus 20. The stones which appeared at first as a surface, were determined to more likely be the foundation to the wall above them. Here is another project to be continued next year.

In other words the context of the L16 changed now it is labeled as 24.      On the other hand we articulated L9 and L15 and after taking some photos, we decided to take off the walls L9 and L15. After this process we have traced and articulated the trench down to the same level of the neighbour trench D8.      We were almost at the same level of trench D8, and for this reason we were scraping L25 when we faced that an ashy pit started to came up (the locus number is 26). L26 act to be round in shape but while we were tracing and articulating it the entire exterior edge of the pit changed. The soil was very loose and soft that the entire soil got just apart and the shape turned out to be square.

Today we will start by cleaning that up, taking photos and elevations and then moving on to a new locus.      L2178 was created to encompass the fill below stone foundation 2176. In the process of removing this fill (2178) another single course stone wall (2179) was uncovered. We now believe that the first single course stone wall (2174) was not a wall at all, but perhaps a boundary for the mud brick wall (2173). The stones were aligned in such a way as a smooth line was created facing the wall and a rough outline facing away from the wall. For more information on this see the locus sheet for L2173 and the associated photographs. The new single course stone wall/boundary (2179) lines up exactly below the original stone boundary (2174), but has a possible brick layer, a definite stone foundation, and possibly more fill between the two loci. This stone boundary (L2179) also aligns with the third (from the west) course of the stone foundation (2176).      Two other large cobbles were also found in the northeast and northwest corners of the sounding respectively. This could represent some sort of passage between walls, etc. that is contained within trench C2, but that is not a part of this sounding. But that is purely hypothesis since only the two cobbles and the space between are in the sounding.      We dug down below the row of cobbles (2179) to see if they continued, but they did not. We did, however, come across a hard baked brick cross-section in the southwestern corner of the sounding. After the two corner cobbles were removed and we continued farther down, the matrix changed in consistency and there was a large amount of very small pebbles in the dirt. This did not appear to be a pebble surface, but with larger excavation of that locus in the trench itself, it might be possible to explore this further.     ,~: C-2-2005-06-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2/Locus 2178,"1353,2005-06-19," F-7-2005-06-19-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Area F, Trench 7   C.

On the other hand we also took L23 down to the same level with L25 .      In addition to these all we tried to catch the lines of the mud-brick wall just beneath L9, since the size of the mud- bricks became larger I gave a new locus number it, now the locus number is 26. While I was trying to articulate L26 my workers Hakan Kilic and Nejat Simsek strated to take down L8 for 2 cm. Aat L8 our aim was to figure out if the mud- bricks of L26 were going on or not. But, when we kept on coming down on L8 we observed that the lines of the mud-brick disappeared and a plasterde surface came up (L28), we had be very careful while we were revealing the plastered surface, because the plaster is very easy to popout.       After all, our aim for tommorow is to figure out the relationship of L28 with L 26 and the rest of the trench. Besides, I also have to mention that on L27 I was able to observe lines of 2 more little pits. This happened just after I took the closing elevations for today.

Possibly, people replaced these surfaces many times in the 2nd millennium.    After that we excavated the door way L75. Under the door way, we found pebble surface materials and some cobbles. It looks like another door way. The two free areas (L77 and L80) are around the door way.   I checked L79 to understand that.

We began by excavating one of the cell rooms (L.100) in order to discover the rooms contents and to possibly find the floor surface associated with wall L.99. After removing 4-5cm we discovered that the entire area was covered w/ mudbricks. I believe that these bricks either used as the rooms floor or used as fill to bolster the structures foundation. This locus is now very similar in composition to L106.       We also cleaned all of L.106 and the entire area is filled with mudbricks packed with mud. The bricks are aligned regularly but do not form a wall feature. By clearing this locus we were able to articulate the bricks in order to than area photograph later in the day. We then began to remove the bricks to find the bottom of walls L.99. In the process of this work we found organic pseudomorphic material between brick courses. This residue is the remains of grain and a sample was taken. Beneath the mudbricks we uncovered a plaster surface.      In the southeastern half of the trench we encountered L.107 and L.108_ÑÓcurrently fill loci. On the surface of L.105 were scattering of sherds and lithics which we initially though were an indication of a floor surface.

The one that is to the southeast of L13 is small and it is regular in shape. But on the other hand L32 is more strange. Besides it has also collapsed mud- bricks in , and because of this it is not easy for us to excavate it.

Baldi      After some discussion as to where to place the next trench on the tepe, it was decided to open a new trench in area F close to two previously excavated trenches. One of these, F 1 was excavated last time in 2002 and a number of interesting features and information were obtained, that trench was dug clear to virgin soil. Likewise trench F 4 was excavated in 2000 and at the time there were questions concerning the edge of the tepe and the possible use of this area by earlier inhabitants of this picturesque location on a bend of the Tigris River. Features of interest of those trenches such as the thick layer of ash, the provenience of collapsed walls, cobble stone layers (roads or floors?) posed a number of questions and contextual possibilities that it was decided to excavate F 19 contiguously East of F 1, and South of F 4. Additionally, a major research question for this area of the Kenan Tepe deals with documenting the extent of the lower town and the relationship to the main mound. Was this a habitational area, or an outlaying production center? Perhaps a center of both commercial and production uses. After examining the thick layers of ash, indicative of a large-scale conflagration one may additionally inquire as to the reasons for its location, and causes; was the area burned down intentionally? Perhaps these were houses that burned? Was this caused by accident, or did an attacking force intentionally burn it down. Being this close to the river, this area would have been one of the first areas to suffer invasion and destruction. By excavating F 19 we seek to answer these and many other questions.      Because of its precarious location, F 19 was originally marked as a 4 meter (N-S) by 3 meter (E-W), but was enlarged on 3 separate occasions to the current 5.80 meters (N-S) by 3.90 meters (E-W) at their widest points. It is not a perfect rectangle by any means. Additionally a small division was left between F 19 and F 1 but these were quickly added to the area of F 19, causing the two trenches to meet at the Western end of F 19, also the Southern edge was also expanded to meet the Northwestern edge of F 4. While it was very useful to have these \open\ baulks to loot at during excavation, the fact that 3 of the walls are non existent decreased the possibilities for a particularly drawable section, which in fact occurred as the North wall is not a very indicative baulk.       Originally we had workers clear the area and remove several top layers. All of these layers were designated as Locus 1. Systematic excavation began at about 0.75 meters below the original surface at its highest level. Obviously collection of cultural indicators was not begun until Locus 2 a surface made out of small (most 5x3 centimeters in dimension) river cobbles. Since we had decided earlier that this surface was not a main area of interest we quickly removed it using the small picks. Nevertheless, this cobble surface appeared to have been constructed of only one row of stone with very little pottery used as construction material. As we removed the surface, the locus was changed to Locus 3 and a bag of subsoil was collected for possible analysis (Locus 3 KT # 2). This light fill was found to be about 0.20 to 0.25 meters in depth. As Locus 3 was being excavated we unearthed a burial pit near the Southwest corner of the trench and next to an area where we thought a wall would appear as excavation continued which in fact it did later (Locus 10). I now believe that the burial cut through not only Locus 3 but also Locus 2 and possibly some of the upper layers. The first bones to appear were the skull bones which were noted to be in particularly bad condition. We would come to realize that much of the skeleton was not there, and that it appeared to have been a secondary burial. The bones were collected as one KT (L 4 KT # 1). The contents of the pit were completely sifted using a fine 2-millimeter mesh and additional fragment of bone were located by this method. A small metal ring was located towards the bottom of the burial pit, and consequently labeled as a small find (L 4 KT # 3). It is unclear what metal was used in its manufacture but it may be copper.       One of the things we knew about this trench before excavation was begun, was that there would be a lot of collapsed bricks. Earlier excavations in both F 1 and particularly in F 4 (refer to notes for these trenches) had shown these as certain possibilities, and so we were expecting them. One of the early proposed ideas was that a massive wall had come down from the South side of F 19 or from inside the area of F 4, we were looking for indicators of where that wall fell from, what were its markers, direction, thickness, and relationships to the other nearby trenches. By the end of this season_Ñés excavations we can say that the wall foundation (Locus 20), was the original foundation to this wall and that its plastered bricks did definitely fall towards the north, possibly hitting another wall running East to West and bouncing back towards what ended up being roughly the middle area of F 19. Additionally, it_Ñés apparent from its signature that the wall proceeded in a North _ÑÐ Northwesterly direction. I am unclear at this juncture as to how far into F 1 or beyond it would have laid.      There were days due to worker issues, or while I was excavating other nearby trenches, or even while enlarging the physical space that work on this trench did not proceed as smoothly and as coordinated as it could have been.       As bricks began appearing we began articulating them, it was clear from the start that they were in quite a jumble as if they had fallen from different directions, or possible a second floor could be considered. A later addition to these notes should include mention of a short section of a wall 0.50 meters thick coming off of the North baulk and heading South for about 1.25 meters before turning East for about 0.78 meters. The jumbled mess of the earlier days led me to believe initially that this was not a wall but collapsed bricks. It is a lot clearer now, and it makes sense to believe that this was definitely a wall, or that at least we should keep track of it and make mention of it in these notes, for it may coordinate with another section of architecture at a later excavating time. I will assign to this wall an interim number as Locus 21-B. Nevertheless it was noted that many of the bricks are made of a light clayish material while others are made from loam soil. An idea proposed for this is that bricks made from lighter clay were manufactured higher up the mound where it was plentiful, while the more coarse bricks, often containing pottery and rock, were manufacture using river mud, or sedimentary layers found closer to the Tigris. I made a decision to ascribe to the jumble of bricks one locus number (Locus 6) as I had expected them to continue for quite some time. This turned out to not be the case. The material of the bricks perhaps became redder, their wall signature on the last portion of the remaining East wall of F 1 indicated a large quantity of the red bricky stuff, with the apparent change, which it may turn out to not be so consequential, I change the Locus to # 8. Looking back at the excavation, I would propose that Loci 6-9 might be considered as one locus as I had originally expected it to be. There were variations that prompted these nomenclatures, but hopefully further investigation may confirm this one way or another. I may also add that some of the markers created plenty of differential characteristics. It must be mentioned that Locus 9 took us to the level just above the burned surface. Upon reaching this level we popped the burned brick and collected lots of material. Some of these materials may enlarge our base of knowledge concerning the manufacture and plastering of bricks. While a more notable mention may relate to the characteristics of the fire, its cause, and direction; and answers about the habitational markers at the time of the blaze. It was noted that as the brick was removed, its white plaster faced down, and so it was protected from the burn by their falling. I believe that the brick were plastered and they fell on to a plastered floor. Very likely that the white-yellowish (Munsell: 10 YR 7/2 Light Gray) plaster material used is the same. Here began the thick ash layer, much of it was collected for floating and sampling when those are more available to us. These and other testing may supply better connections for the contemporaneity of the surface (Locus 14) and the mass of bricks on top of it. It also provided a nice sealing to those materials that laid on the surface (L 14 KT #_Ñés 1-18). Additionally the very top of the surface (Locus 12) yielded a lot of pottery some of them with good diagnostics probabilities. From and on site read at the site many are characteristic of Second Millennium EB, Chalcolithic, and possibly even a painted Chalcolithic, or Ubaid sherd was picked up right off the strewn surface. The already mentioned surface below all of these materials (Locus 14) and the subsequent subfloor (Locus 15) were completely removed using the Household Archaeology Protocol, all of the contents of a 0.50 by 0.50 meter square were removed for HAP sampling, 2 litters from the middle were removed prior to sifting for HAP float, while the remaining contents of the surface were sifted, this accounted for a full day_Ñés work and 756 litters of sifted materials, collection was done from the sifted soil. The subfloor yielded an additional 220.5 liters, and the same protocol was employed throughout. In an effort to see if the surface extended East I opened Locus 17, while the plastered surface seemed to continue, the potsherd, stone, and bone material was not found on top of it. This leads me to believe that there was a physical separation between the two surfaces. One piece of pottery we did find on L 17 was very nicely decorated and indented Chalcolithic sherd. ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_ë_      The good results on the East side of the trench prompted the continuing excavating of the area which showed us a wall (Locus 18) which was followed North but not terminated due to time constraints. Next season_Ñés work should endeavor to terminate this wall (L 18) and to possibly establish a connection to Locus 5b, the wall Locus 10, or the stone foundation (to Locus 10) known now as Locus 20. The fill above, rather the bricky material above the stone foundation (Locus 20) was assigned Locus 19. One interesting characteristic of L 20, is that the stones appear to have a Northwesterly direction with a section of 6 stones appearing to jut out in a Northerly direction; it is unclear as this point if they continued below the current surface (L 15) or if they were only used as a way to buttress up the wall. This also can be looked up next season. Better definition of L 10 and L 5b is desirable in order to establish better relationships with other architecture and features within the trench, and to help us in connecting the trenches in a systematic and purposeful manner. Interestingly, other than the burial pit (L 4) only one other pit was located in the Northeast quadrant and assigned (Locus 16), this pit, which contained one small subdivision towards the West, did not contain a lot of good pottery. It was notice that a small area on the bottom of the shallow pit was full of very small pebble, I believed by looking at the pit_Ñés wall that it was deposited there along with some ash from the upper ashy level by the erosional forces of water.      It can be said that F 19 was an exciting and interesting trench to dig. As usual I wish I had done a lot of things differently and better. Despite this, a lot of good information was obtained which help us to better look at the usage and habitational patters of the lower town of Kenan Tepe.       It can be surmised from the excavation that most of F 19 laid within and enclosure with a plastered floor and flanked by plastered walls on the East, the South, and the Northwest quadrant area. Additionally there was a wall running East _ÑÐ West (L 5b) which may be intercepted by the East wall running South _ÑÐ North. The continuation of walls, especially those going West help us make some assertions about their relationship with those trenches dug nearby, mainly F 1, but also F 4, F 22, F 20, F 8, and F 9. It is clear that many levels of habitation through time can be documented; additionally we can establish a contemporaneous existence at the time of the large fire. Hopefully a more extensive and close read of the pottery and the HAP material will help give us better clues as to causes, and usage.               ,~dc-terms:title: F-19-2005-06-22-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 19,"1369,2005-06-22," E-2-2005-06-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 114,","   Daily     Area E, Trench 2   June 22nd, 2005   J.

In this fill, we also recovered two small white beads (KT 3) and a ceramic animal head (KT 7). As with L134, we recovered a lot of ceramics and lithics from this locus. In removing this locus we are better able to see L114, and in the interest of time, I did not excavate the eastern section of this locus. I also brought L136 down further, and we uncovered a bone deposit in the center of the locus.      I cut away a section of the L105 pit, but was unable to find any evidence for mudbricks. Finally, after scrapping L142, I found the outlines of pit cutting the locus (L147). There are several mudbrick within the pit, which may have originally been a part of mudbrick walls in the L142 area. I excavated the entire pit, which was fairly large and extended into L140. The pit was a mixture of mudbrick debris, tan sandy soil and ashy deposits. It is the final in a series of pits that have mixed the context of this area. By bringing down L147, we are better able to see the section of L114 that ran through the bottom of L115 and 124 (pits). It is now very clear that L114 runs diagnally across the trench.       Our final effort today was to clear out L137 in order to eventually remove L146. We brought down the interior fill, and found a thin line of white organic residue near the level of the rim of the pot (L146). This may have been the original surface level of this room. At the moment, I am unsure how deep these walls extend into the ground. L146 is clearly a pot burial, and this size of the pot suggests that it is an adult. The pot is cut into a section of L114, and I will remove it entirely tomorrow.     ,~: E-2-2005-06-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 114,"1370,2005-06-22," D-10-2005-06-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 10/Locus 30,","   Area D Trench 10    June 22, 2005    S. Torpil         Our day started by taking elevations for the entire trench. Then we began to articulate L32, which was thought to be pit yesterday, but today after articulating it turned out to be clear that L32 is a chewed up wall. Most parts of the wall are sitting in trench D8, but I am going to mark it in my dayplan. Besides articulating and revealing L32 we have taken the entire trench for 10 cm down (the entire trench except for the pits L5, L31, and the chewed up wall L32).       After breakfast we began to sweep the trench, than we were planning to close up the trench for this season. But during our sweeping process just to the south of L13 I was able to observe the line of another pit. But when I articulated it, I was able to observe that it was just a series of animal holes.       But all in all, when I was trying to sweep and to clean the trench I have observed lines of a possible mud-brick wall running from the northwest to the south east corner of the trench. To make sure if the lines are continuing in trench D8 I have checked it out with Emily Ogle who was excavating D8. According to her the lines are coming up to her trench, but for me it is too early to say that, because D8 is not down at the same level with D10 yet. When Dr. Bradley Parker came to check the trenches, we asked what is idea would be, and he said that he was not able to see the lines in trench D8 yet.      All in all, this means that D10 will be closed tomorrow, because first I need to make clear where the lines of the mud-brick wall L33 is ending. Today the closing elevations were taken from D6, and the datum for D6 is 590.01 and the instrument height was 1.22.        ,~: D-10-2005-06-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 10/Locus 30,"1371,2005-06-22," D-8-2005-06-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 76,","   Daily Trench Summary   Area D   Trench 8   June 22, 2005   E.O.      Today is my first day back in the field after being ill in the dig house for the past two days. Yesterday Barish Uzel excavated my trench on Bradley_Ñés orders and so I spent the morning going over all the information, locus sheet, day plan etc from yesterday. One thing worth mentioning is that what I had thought was a floor abutting L.102 apparently was not. This area (now divided into three loci: 105, 107, 107) was taken down 10cm. Today we went down inside the cell rooms. This included loci 109, 110 and 111. All of these loci were taken down at least 5cm.      L. 109 was only a few cm deep. Almost immediately we began finding a white floor (L. 113) made of pseudo morphic organic remains. Two workmen were able to trace the floor up to the wall. This floor is very uneven, differing in elevation in some places by 20cm. Clearly this space was filled in by organic material rather than a surface that was constructed. It is therefore possibly that this is not a living space but a storage space. We were not able to articulate the entire area today. It is proving very hard to trace because the surface is so uneven. In places there is so much soil on top that the workmen are having to use small picks to get it off before they can go back to using trowels to trace it.      We found a few brick lines in L.112. It does not look as regular and even as the brick lines that were in L.100 yesterday. I took several photos of it but I do not think it was a surface or feature the way that the bricks in L.100 were. For now I am keeping this as fill and we will see what happens as we get further down in this locus.      ,~: D-8-2005-06-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 76,"1372,2005-06-22," D-6-2005-06-22 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 72,","   Daily    Area G, Trench 7   June 22, 2005   Baris UZEL          Today, we started to excavate all surface L72, because we will finish to excavation at the trench today.

Eppihimer      INTRODUCTION      This season_Ñés work in trench F2 marked the continuation of a trench opened in 2000 and excavated in 2001 most recently. The trench is located in Area F to the east of F7 and to the north of F8 near the edge just before the drop-off down to the Tigris. At the beginning of the season the trench was believed to be 4.25 by 4.25 m, but remeasuring later in the season showed that (at its working level) it measured 4.35 (E-W) by 4.45 m (N-S). The trench was open from June 1st to June 23rd, 2005.       The opening elevations for the season ranged from 568.62 to 568.71 m, and the trench was roughly level across its entirety. The closing elevations at the end of the season ranged from 567.31 to 568.05 m, and numerous walls, features, and pits remained in the uneven trench. In general, throughout the season about one meter of soil was removed.      STRATIGRAPHY and LOCI      To start, a general cleaning locus across the whole trench (2024) was removed to clear away any contamination from the days between the removal of the off-season protective fill and the start of actual excavation on June 1st. Thereafter, I tried to coordinate any visible soils and features with those from the end of the 2001 season. Only the rocky area in the northeast (2018) could be identified and was removed in 2024. The wall 2019 was not visible, nor could the other soil-defined loci be distinguished. The only distinction present was between an ashy area in the south (2026, 2027) and the rest of the trench (2025).      The first feature to emerge was a line of orange, burnt mudbricks in the SW corner. This turned out to be a mudbrick feature (2029), initially thought to be a platform, but later determined to be a brick-lined burial. The feature extended through the west baulk and into trench F7 (locus 7139). The burial was excavated as part of F7. Unfortunately, the segment in F2 was removed beforehand, so the complete feature was never exposed intact. The bricks included two orange burnt bricks, but the rest were yellow with pieces of yellow, green, and white clay. The feature was arbitrarily pedestalled during much of the season, so the soil underneath (2047) was a mixed locus. No surfaces were associated with this feature. Perhaps it was a pit cut into the levels around it that was lined with bricks for the burial. See the F7 summary, however, for a more in-depth discussion of the possibilities.      The next set of features (the first of two major contexts this season) became visible the morning after a heaving rainstorm drenched the site. These included an L-shaped wall (2034) from which a mudbrick layer/platform (2033) extended to the east. The fill around these features was divided into three areas: to the northeast 2030, to the northwest 2031, and to the south 2032. A circular concentration of ash in the area of 2030 was excavated thinking that it would be a pit but proved not to be (2028).      As we came down in 2031 we observed a layer of red bricky material (2038) that lacked brick-lines but had a distinct eastern edge. Its southern edge was less distinct. This layer is visible in the section, but again its depositional history is unclear. The soil underneath this was locus 2046, equal to 2041 (see below).      As we came down in 2030 to the east of wall 2034 and to the north of the mudbrick platform/layer 2033, we came upon a pebble surface with several flat-lying potsherds (2035). This surface was not continuous. It was removed using the HAP procedure. In its southern end, it could be shown to run under the area of 2033, suggesting that 2033 post-dated the surface. The sub-surface fill was locus 2036.      The removal of the mudbrick platform/layer of 2033 did not produce any specific brick-lines, although the edges of the feature were clear and linear. At the point where 2033 ran up to wall 2034, there was a potsherd standing vertically, showing that the two features were not bonded. The soil underneath was removed as locus 2037.       After reaching the bottom of wall 2034, its construction was observed: two staggered courses, each with one row of mudbricks. The dimensions of the mudbricks differed between the two segments of the wall, north and south. The subwall fill was locus 2039. Beyond 2033 and 2035, no additional features, surfaces, or foundation pits were associated with this wall. It did not continue to the west beyond the initially observed length, nor did it reach to the north baulk. If not an issue of preservation, this might suggest that the wall is not a four-sided structure, but some type of retaining wall or separating installation.       Both the bricky layer 2038 and wall 2034 were resting upon an ashy layer. With no features in the trench at this time, this layer was divided arbitrarily into two halves, in the west 2041 and in the east 2040.       While digging in 2040, the first glimpse of the second major context emerged. In the northeast, a plaster line running northeast to southwest separated the trench into two new loci: 2044 to the east and 2043 to the west. As we came down in 2043 there was an ashy concentration in the northwest corner (2048).      Loci 2043 and 2044 were cut by an ash pit (2042). The excavation of the ash pit (which also contained mudbrick chunks) produced a ceramic cylinder seal with linear vegetal motifs, KT F.2.2042.7. The soil in the ash pit at around 567.55 m changed to a pure soft ash and a number of human child toe and ankle bones started to come out of the western part of the pit down to 567.45 m. Not knowing whether this was still part of the pit, part of a disturbed burial, or part of the layers that the pit cut into, we stopped excavation here until the rest of the trench came down to this layer. At the end of the season, the question remained open.      To give us a window into the up-coming stratigraphy, two sections were cut into the walls of the pit (2045). These showed a number of plaster lines and mudbrick walls that would guide the excavation plan for the rest of the season. We stopped the sections vertically at the level of a plaster surface (2065). This surface ran up to but stopped at the line of plaster that marked the divide between loci 2043 and 2044. In the north section 2045 the area to the east of this line was mudbrick, now designated as wall 2050. In the south section 2045 the area to the east of this line was also mudbrick (now designated as locus 2051). However, this feature differed from 2050 because it also had a horizontal plaster line visible in the section (just below the working level of 2044). While continuing to remove 2044 in this area, we determined that this horizontal plaster surface was approximately rectangular and was nestled into the southeast corner of wall 2050, which turned to the west at this point. The prevailing hypothesis viewed this feature as a plastered niche within the corner of the wall. Later in the season, to the north of the pit a second plaster line emerged that was parallel to the first one, but aligned with the division between the niched platform and the wall to the south. From this, it is possible that in the north wall 2050 is a double wall construction, or perhaps the two are to be divided into the main 2050 wall in the east and then the niche (2051) and a secondary wall running parallel to 2050 up to the niche in the west. Future excavation may explain more, but the pit cuts through the important juncture. A thin plaster line in the east section of pit 2042 may be the last remaining evidence of this juncture.      Not knowing whether wall 2050 extended further west, we divided the rest of the trench into three loci. Drawing an imaginary continuation of wall 2050, the area to the south was divided into 2053 in the southwest corner and 2057 to its east. The latter was separated from the former because of its brick-like appearance. After removing 2053 and observing the section under 2057, it was determined that 2057 was a layer of bricky material (slump? debris?) and not a wall or other feature.      To the north of this imaginary line in the northwest was 2054. The area to its east closest to wall 2050 was 2052. As these were removed, the plaster line marking the northern edge of wall 2050 extended as far as the western baulk. To determine the southern edge of the wall at this point, a section was cut along the baulk (2058), which showed the wall to be 50 cm wide.       Near the northern part of 2050 within locus 2052, multiple plaster layers were observed, but these were difficult to trace and were not always continuous. They may reflect debris and collapse rather than actual surfaces. One surface (2056) was traced enough to be sampled as a white plaster surface with pseduomorphs that ran up to wall 2050. The soil underneath this was 2059.       Now that interior and exterior were clearly separated by wall 2050, the soil inside the structure was united into locus 2061 and the soil to the south (that is the \""exterior\"") was redefined as 2060. In the extreme southeast, also an _ÑÉexterior_Ñé area, a pebble surface (2049), subsurface fill (2055), and two distinct soil areas (2062 and 2063) were excavated sequentially. At the end of the season, the nature of the linear distinction between 2062 (a gray pebbly soil) and 2063 (a compact brown soil) remained unclear.      To the south of wall 2050 in the \""exterior\"" area, a row of coarse broken potsherds placed horizontally upon rocks (2068) started to emerge along the southern baulk, parallel to but one meter removed from wall 2050. This may turn out to be a wall, but excavation stopped before this was fully determined.      To the north and west of wall 2050 and niche 2051, the \""interior\"" area was filled with mud brick fragments, plaster debris and ash all the way to the north and west baulks. Only in the extreme northwest corner was the brick more concentrated. This later proved to be the location of the western wall of this structure, as indicated by a plaster line on its interior face. The wall was preserved to a maximum height of 1 cm above the plaster surface 2065, which ran up against it. This wall (2064) had a segment protruding southeast into the room. It is unclear if this marks a subdivision or an entranceway, as the important area where this wall could potentially join 2050 remains in the baulk.       After removing the debris in 2061 down to the level of the plaster surface, the surface could be seen extending across the entire \""interior\"" area and running up to and against the plaster-covered walls of 2050 and 2064, and the 2051 platform. Two circular features cut the surface. A small pit was filled with many small broken pieces of coarse potsherds and a few chunks of plaster (2066). A larger circular feature with a 6 cm-wide ring around it (2067) proved to be a 3 cm thick pit covering a compact black ashy surface/layer (2069) into which a complete string-cut base bowl was set (2070). Not knowing if the black ash continued under surface 2065, a section was cut into half of the feature (2071). This showed that the bowl was set into an area of orange soil. Surrounding this soil was the compacted ash of 2069, but beneath this was a pebble layer and brown soil. These layers were visible on all sides of the section, suggesting that they may extend under the surface 2065. The eastern half of the feature was left intact for future excavation. The function of this installation is unclear. The rim of the bowl was level with the compact ashy soil of 2069, together only 3 cm beneath the level of the surface 2065. This surface ran up to but did not cover the 6 cm ring around this feature, suggesting that the feature was in use while the surface was in use. Very few artifacts came from this feature.      The plaster surface 2065 was removed using the HAP procedure to a total of 44.5 9-liter buckets, plus the HAP sample and the two-liter HAP float. The volume of this sample reflects not a single occupational surface but rather a series of superimposed surfaces. While removing the HAP square, it was difficult to separate each individual surface. Therefore, the whole sequence was removed as one locus. The sequence of surfaces included at least 3 plastered surfaces (with multiple layers in each) and one pebble surface. These surfaces were different colors (green, orange, brown) and separated by brown fill layers. The soil beneath the surface was soft and ashy (2072).       METHODS      During the season, a number of methods were used to excavate. Whenever the trench was largely empty of features, big picks were used to take down the soil in 10 cm increments.    When working in fill but within contexts, small picks were used but keeping in mind the possibility that surfaces and features might emerge. This was done in increments from 3 to 10 cm as needed. Surfaces were removed using trowels, and the large surface of 2065 and the plaster walls of 2050 and 2051 were exposed by popping off the debris covering them using a trowel. Trowels were also used to articulate the walls and edges of pits.       FINDS      During the season, beyond the expected finds of pottery, bone and lithics, only a few small finds were recovered. The most unique is a ceramic cylinder with linear vegetal motifs from pit 2042 (KT F.2.2042.7). From pit 2066 is a fragment of an animal figurine (KT F.2.2066.6). From the debris covering the plaster surface were a number of grindstone fragments (KT F.2.2061.15, .21), a ceramic loom weight (KT F.2.2061.23), an animal figurine (KT F.2.2061.25) and carbonized wheat seeds (KT F.2.2061.5, .11, .24). From the layers of the surface itself was a stone bead with multiple perforations (KT F.2.2065.5). Possibly associated with surface 2049 is a large grindstone (KT F.2.2044.4). A round pounding stone (KT F.2.2063.2) was resting alongside an animal skull to the east of wall 2050 on top of locus 2063.       DATING      Most of the pottery has not yet been read, but the earliest structure probably dates to the Late Chalcolithic. The complete bowl with string-cut base (KT F.2.2070.1) within the circular pit feature contemporaneous with surface 2065 and thus the structure of walls 2050, 2051, and 2064, should date these contexts. Also, the sherds in pit 2066 provide a date as well.      The pottery from the later context of wall 2034, mudbrick feature 2033, and surface 2035 needs to be read before a date can be suggested. The reading of 2035 suggests an EB-Late Chalco date.      In addition to pottery, carbon samples were taken from these contexts as well as from the pit 2042, which should date the cylinder seal.      INTERPRETATION      Two major contexts were uncovered during this season. The earliest consists of a structure with plastered mudbrick walls (2050, 2064) and a plastered niche (?) (2051). Multiple superimposed plaster surfaces (2065) represent the occupation levels of the structure. The finds suggest that the function is more likely domestic than industrial, but the surface was cleared of most occupational remains. Instead, clues can be found in the debris inside the structure (2061) and in a pit (2066) and an enigmatic circular feature (2067) that cut the surface.      The later context consists of a retaining (?) wall (2034) and an associated surface (2035) and subsequent mudbrick platform feature (2033).       The two contexts are similarly oriented, suggesting some degree of continuity between the two, but they are not placed one on top of the other. It will be interesting to compare the dating of the two.      FUTURE EXCAVATION      At the close of the season, a number of loci remained in the trench: 2042 (pit), 2050 (wall), 2051 (niche), 2060 (fill), 2062 (pebbly fill), 2063 (compact fill), 2064 (wall), 2066 (hole from pit), 2068 (sherd and rock wall?), 2069 (ashy layer in installation), 2072 (ashy-subsurface layer). Future excavation should work through these loci with the following questions in mind:   ë_Can 2051 be confirmed as a niche?    ë_What is the nature of the double wall construction in the north end of 2050?    ë_How and why is the distinction between the soils in 2062 and 2063 so distinct?    ë_What is the sequence of deposition of feature 2069 and what is its function?    ë_Have we reached the bottom of walls 2050 and 2064?    ë_How does the southern spur of 2050 relate to the rest of the wall?    ë_Does wall 2050 continue west into trench F7?                   ë_           "",~dc-terms:title"": ""F-2-2005-06-23-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2"","1376,2005-06-23," E-2-2005-06-023-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2,","E-2-2005   Final Trench Summary 2005   Area E, Trench 2   J. Henecke      Introduction      Trench E2 is located half way up the southern side of the tepe, facing the Tigris River. In 2000, a 2 x 1 meter sounding (E1) was excavated in this area, and during the 2004 season, the sounding was enlarged to 5.8 x 4 meters. The trench lies in close proximity to area D, and although the area between them is disturbed by numerous pits (see D10), it may be possible to use E2 and D8 for comparisions. In the previous season, the excavators discovered a thick deposit from a 2nd millenium road, which most likely runs around the tepe, and at lower levels, the excavators uncovered Ubaid sherds and concentrations of chert and obsidian lithics.       I began the season by expanding the southeastern baulk by 2 meters (L41), and the trench now has the dimensions of 5.9 x 6. Our goal this season was to bring the entire trench down to the sounding level (about 586.35 meters above sea level), and by enlarging the trench, we hoped to gain a large perspective into these lower levels. The sounding produced quantities of decorated Ubaid sherds and obsidian flakes, and by reaching the sounding level, we hoped to reveal more of these Ubaid levels. My starting elevations were: W 587.60, N 587.74, E 587.46 and S 587.72, with a datum height of 590.01. My first action was to identity and renumber old loci from the previous season. This included the fill in the western corner (old L32, new L48) and fill in the center of the western half (old L36, new L47). I was able to identify mudbrick wall L35 and 37 from last season (new L42 and 43), but I combined L38 _ÑÐ which was thought to be a mudbrick wall _ÑÐ and 39 into a single fill locus (L46). I also combined the pebbly area (L2 and 10) above the sounding into a single locus (L44). Although the last day plan from last season showed features within the old sounding level, I made it a single locus (L45) because the surface appeared very ed.       Excavation      Our initial efforts at the beginning of the season were designed at clearing away old topsoil and features from last season. We removed the baulk (L41) very quickly, and although the topsoil was removed, the fill beneath this (L49) was also heavily disturbed. It was not until May 22nd, when we uncovered the group of pottery (L55) against wall L43 that we could be certain this area contained uncontaminated contexts. Erosion off the tepe has been a major factor in mixing the fill, and the erosion line is clearly visible in the northeastern and southwestern baulks. Until we excavated beyond this line, the entire area was predominatley mixed contexts. In addition to the effects of erosion, ing throughout the year had damaged many of last year_Ñés features. Walls L43 and 42 crisscrossed the trench, but unfortunatley, they were too partial and disconnected to reveal anything significant about architecture. Therefore, I quickly excavated them to reveal fresh surfaces beneath.       The first week of excavation was useful for highlighting two points that would be continous throughout the season. Natural erosion and human activity _ÑÐ namely, pits _ÑÐ contributed to the mixing of large portions of the trench, and the identification of these forces was very useful for understanding the trench_Ñés stratigraphy and layout. Secondly, although the trench had been enlarged, it was very difficult to correlate features across the site. As with walls L43 and L42, many of the surfaces and walls we uncovered were partial and/or isolated, but a grasp of the cause of these disturbances may elucidate the missing gaps in the trench_Ñés picture.      Upon removal of L42, which is visible to a height of 8 courses in the southwestern baulk, we uncovered sealed surface L50. After scraping L44, we uncovered a similar surface. The surface had been blownout, and the two did not directly touch except in the baulk. About 20 centimeters below this level, within the subsurface soil (L52) was a stone wall (L53), and this wall may have blownout this pebble and sherd encrusted surface. The wall is composed of medium sized stones, and there is a door socket near the northwestern baulk. We also found a stone with similar alignment beneath L48, and I believe this wall stretched across this area. I took a HAP sample (L51), a soil sample and sifted all material, and although it was sealed, the pottery is a mixture of EB and Ubaid. Mudbrick wall L42 above it, however, was from the Chalcolithic, and it can be assumed that L53 is a later intrusion into this architecture. However, on the surface of the L44 subsoil (L54), we found a small row of mudbricks. This may be mudbrick slump off the wall, which would place the wall in an earlier period that the surfaces.      Rather than removing L43, I began to clear away L49 in order to see how far the wall extended into the southeastern baulk. The wall did not seem to be effected by erosional activity until the extreme eastern end, and this may indicate the extent of the erosion during this period. Several interesting features emerged during the excavation of L49, including evidence for an oven installation with a small pebbled surface nearby. We discovered a few pieces from a tanoor oven (KT 14) along with ashy soil, and the pebbled surface (L56) was also too partial to connect with other features. There was also an incomplete human burial (L62) near the eastern corner. The burial pit had most likely been dug into the side of the tepe at a later period, and only a jaw, leg and a few ribs remained. Pressed up against the join between the southwestern baulk and L43, we found a group of 5 pots apparently in their original position. The pots are largely whole (KT 5-12), with the soil preserved in 3 of them. They appear to be from the EB or Late Chalcolithic, and touch both the wall and a packed mud surface (L60). The surface is burnt in the western corner, and the fill above it contained ash and carbon. I took a HAP (L57) and sifted all material from this floor. After removing the pots, a corner in L43 is visible, and we believe that both the pots and the wall continue into the southwestern baulk. Later in the season, while we were waiting to take plan shots, we excavated a 2 x 3 area (L82) in the southwestern baulk in an effort to find the remainder of this feature. Unfortunatley, we only had time to remove about a meter of topsoil _ÑÐ in which we discovered the same 2nd millenium floor _ÑÐ and excavation will have to wait until next season.      An interesting connection between various features at this level is visible in the baulks. It appears that the line of L50 and 44 may extend across towards L43. This would place these floors concurrent with L60 and the pot grouping in L55. Further, it seems that the line may also run across toward L56, which would connect this partial surface with the rest of the trench. I believe the features at this level are connected and can be viewed as a whole.      With the removal of both these walls and the L43 subsoil (L64), the number of loci collapsed, and the trench was divided between the large mixed fill L65 and the area to the northwest of the sounding level (L58). The area was marked by a distinct grayish soil, which continued into the deeper levels of the trench. L58 was cut by a small ash pit (L63), which may have been associated with or related to the pebbled surface L66. The pit seems to have at least cut through this surface. L66 is the first in a series of floors (L81, L94) that have a similar position and dimensions. I took a HAP (L67) from this small area, which only had a volume of 36 L, and removed its subsurface (L68). After the removal of L69 _ÑÐ grayish fill _ÑÐ the area was naturally divided by clefts in the soil, which were intially thought to indicate pits or walls, and further split by the L94 surface. L86 and 101 abutted L70 and contained a series of ashy lenses and ashy deposits directly adjacent to the wall. This seems to indicate some activity on this side of the wall. L84, 87, 102 and 104 in the northern corner were a generic gray compact fill with little cultural material.      Our first significant feature emerged at the end of May. Within L65, a wall composed of medium to large stones, emerged with approximatley the same position and alignment as L53. This wall formed the boundary between the expanding grayish soils of L58 and 69 and the light tan fill to the north (L71). At the same time, mudbrick wall L72 appeared across the southern corner, leaving a small section of fill (L73) in the corner. The fill between these two areas was very mixed (L71 and 76), but beneath this L78 contained a scattering of pebbles across the entire area. The scatter was low density but had the appearance of a street surface. It is our belief that L70, 72 and 78 was a street with bounded by two structures. When we finally removed L72, it was apparent that the pebbly surface abutted the wall and did not pass beneath it. The grayish soil to the north of L70 (L69), may have been the interior of this structure, although no cultural materials were found to confirm this. We took a plan shot of this feature, and I also took a HAP (L83) and soil sample, in addition to sifting the entire L78 surface. The sherds from this surface are predominatley from the Chalcolithic. L70 extended fairly deeply into the surface -- about 3 stone heights _ÑÐ and half was removed on 6/1 and the remainder on 6/8. It was also difficult to find the bottom of L72, and I cut away a .5 meter section along the southwestern baulk to find it_Ñés limits. The wall in this part only had a single course, while there are three visible in the southeastern baulk.      I divided the area _ÑÐ formerly L65 _ÑÐ to the southeast of L45 into a northern (L75) and southern (L77) half. I wanted to ensure that if the extreme end of the trench was still being effected by erosion, these mixed contexts would not contaminate other areas. It seemed that the continuation of L72 mudbricks into the baulk suggested the soil had not been disturbed. We excavated ash pit L74 from the eastern corner, cutting L77, and at the bottom found a row of small stones (L92). Stretching diagonally across L77 and 75 was a mudbrick wall (L79), although it did not extend beneath L78, and was probably disrupted by the mixed fill and pits beneath that area. The wall did not extend as far as originally thought, and later in the season, I removed L91 as extra soil to the east of the actual bricks. This was was fairly insubstantial and may in fact have only been a pile of mudbricks. When removing L91, we found traces of organic pseudomorph that suggested a surface, but there was no evidence of this beneath the wall.       This entire area of the trench _ÑÐ about 2.5 x 2.5 meters _ÑÐ was so small that it was only after excavation that we were able to identify several features. I excavated L77 as fill, and I initially attributed mudbrick debris and organic pseudomorph to mudbrick slump from L79. I now believe that there may have been a surface in this area, perhaps connected to the evidence in L91 and associated with L79. We discovered a mortar stone and weight ? (KT 4 and 5) resting upright and in a line, which may be more evidence for a surface in this area. L75 also seems to have contained more than mere fill. I dug the locus in 15 centimeter chunks, but after its removal I noticed a dark line in the wall of L79. This may have been a burnt layer or a differentiation in the fill, but it did not appear in our excavation. I assigned L80 to the area to the east of L75 because there was a distinct line in the soil between these sections. It is possible that L75 was a pit that cut through L80, which why it does not appear in other areas. L80, 85, 88 and 90 are a series of ashy fill deposits and flat lying pot sherds and lithics. The area was so small _ÑÐ 1.5 x 1 meter _ÑÐ that it was impossible to tell if any of these levels were surfaces, and I believe L85 may have been several layers of floors resting atop one another. These levels maybe present to a larger extent in the northeastern baulk. It is impossible to connect these loci with any other surfaces or walls, and there is no evidence for them in last year_Ñés day plans. At the bottom of these layers was a pile of stone and lithic fragments _ÑÐ including production material, cores and flakes _ÑÐ and this may be the remains of a lithic production area (L106), and this feature was in contact with L92. As I reached the sounding level in this area, I made each section part of L100, which was even with L45.      When I finally reached the sounding level, the trench was divided into L101 and 104 in the northwestern half, L103 _ÑÐ a very mixed fill, cut by ash pit L105 _ÑÐ in the western half and L45 and 100 in the eastern half. At this point, I cleaned and renumbered the loci. The trench is now divided into roughly equal halves along the east-west diagonal. After removing the thin L45 ed surface, the northern half contained L107, 108 and 111. This area is clearly distinct in color and texture from the rest of the trench, being more gray and compact. Two sections of mudbrick wall (L116/114) span the divide, and though cut out by pits, the wall seems to be a continous structure. To the south, L110 and 112 are fill and L119 is a stone wall cut by L105. This entire section of the trench, specifically near L112, seems riddled with pits, which explains much of the mixed content of the fill loci (65, 98 and 103) above.       A plastered surface, with decorated Ubaid sherds and lithics (L118) emerged from L108, and soon spread across the entire area to the north of L116/114. The plaster clearly abuts L116, and in fact, indicates a row of bricks no longer preserved on this wall. I believe that this surface is the predecessor of the series of more fragmentary surfaces discovered above it (L66, 81 and 94), which may have been blownout by later accumulations. Beneath this surface was a thin subsoil that contained evidence for lithic production (KT 7 and 8). The surface beneath this L134, was very similar to L118, although the plaster was more poorly preserved, and it contained further evidence for domestic activities, including a beer strainer and mortar stone (KT 4 and 11). I took HAP samples (L126 and 135) from both surfaces. Initially, we thought that L118 may have been an interior surface -- associated with L116/114, 120 and 119 _ÑÐ but it now seems that this area was the exterior while the southern half is the structural interior. This is further indicated by the architecture (L143) discovered at the end of the season. These areas are clearly in Ubaid context and will be very important for understanding domestic activities from this period.       All these levels are associated with the L114/116 wall. L114 is a well preserved mudbrick wall with three rows, while the L116 section is only preserved in two disjointed rows. There is, however, Ubaid sherds wedged into L116 that are essential for dating this wall (KT 1). Pits L117, 115 and 124 cut into this wall, and L114 -- the complete wall _ÑÐ is visible beneath these pits. Clearly, the pits are of a later date than L114. On 6/20 and 6/22, I removed the standing portion of L116 and closed this locus, combining the entire wall into L114. While removing L116, I noticed that L134 passes beneath a section of this wall, which I believe indicates and addition or modification of the wall rather than the presence of a different wall.      L119 is a stone wall running almost parallel to L116, and it was originally thought that these two formed another street feature. However, the excavation of the area between these walls (L110, 120 and 132) gave no indication of a street surface. It is possible that the street was an interface rather than a true surface. The fill in L120 was much more pebbly and loose near L116 and more compacted by L119. I believe the scattering of pebbles in L120 is the best possibility for a street surface. Evidence for erosion in the northwestern baulk suggests a different interpretation of the relationship between L114/116 and areas south of L119. There are mudbricks visible in the northwestern baulk, and although L116 does not physically extend this far, I believe they are the same. Above these bricks is a dark gray line, which may indicate the line of erosion off the tepe. In this case, all the material south of L119 may have been effected by erosion and impossible to associate with L114/116. Depending on where the erosion line falls, L119 may be of an entirely separate context that L116/114. South of L119, were two small pebble surfaces (L122 and 133), cut by various pits (L105 and 123). L122 in particular may have been associated with the street feature, but it did not touch L119, which maybe a result of erosional forces. I took a HAP sample from this surface (L125) and sifted and sampled all L133.      Finally, in the last few days of the season, we found the outline of a single cell room. L114 is the northern wall, and L143 is the west, east and south walls to this room. Within the room (L137) was organic residue, possibly evidence for the cleaning out of grain storage, in addition to a large pot burial carved into L114. The burial contains an adult skeleton, possibly female, with porous holes in the skull. On either side of the cell room is an area of indistinguishable mudbrick (L144 and 142). I believe L144, which extends into the southwestern baulk, is a corner of another cell room that may be filled with mudbrick debris. L142 may also have been another cell room, which was cut by pit L147. The entire structure probably extended to the south, but was cut out by pits and erosion. This structure is very interesting in view of the architecture in D8, which has an entire Ubaid house with similar cell room architecture.       At the end of the season, the trench has only begun to reveal Ubaid levels, and there are numerous indications that much more lies beneath the surface. For example, the L134 subsoil (L145) contains a concentration of stones, which seems to indicate the arrival of another surface. Also, there is a burnt line beneath this level visible in the wall of pit L124 and evidence for another surface at the bottom of this pit. Next year we should continue to excavate in this area to find more information about the cell room structure and earlier Ubaid levels.

It was entirely new trench with length 10 m and width 5 m started up on the new spot on May 22, 2005. Originally there was idea to place the trench following Andy_Ñés radiographic pictures showing up so called \busy\ places indicating approximate remains under the top soil. Later on Bradley decided to open the trench following one line below G 9. The main reason of starting up this trench was to ensure the possibility of occupation of this part of the tepe.     From that point the excavating in this specifically spot became very successful. Over the course of this excavating season we went 2 m below the top surface, at the highest top elevation 574.14, and the lowest elevation at the end of the season 572.14. Almost immediately under the first 30 cm top soil we came across of great boulder wall foundation (L 2 and L 4). According to the ceramic material found in synchronic level this wall foundation refers to Early Bronze Age settlement. In the North-West corner of the trench, at the elevations a little below the bottom of the stone wall foundation, were uncovered evidences of long term domestic activity (L 7). The proves of this statement is the attestation of definite pebbled floor surface with simultaneous fire place (not designated as separate locus because the main part of it stayed under the baulk), purposely built circle stands (see field photos, L 7), most likely for holding the pots, significant amount of shards, animal bones and a bronze needle (L 7: KT# 3). Along with this feature we came across of stone structure protruding from the North baulk (see the day plan from May 29, 2005 and following field pictures). Synchronically was found a little pebbled patch in the middle of the trench (L 10) that was possibly associated with the floor surface in L 7. At this point is difficult to do any definite interpretations because if this is a complex of some domestic activity its main part is under the West and North-West baulk. After that we removed about 25-30 cm of dirt and debris. Notable was relatively small amount of ceramic shards and two grinding stones (L 8: KT# 4 and L 9: KT# 6). At elevations 572.78 _ÑÐ 572.71 we came across of architectural structure. This was relatively large room, luckily placed diagonally across the trench (L 15), which gave us chance to follow its North-East and South-West corners and the three wall lines (see the day plan from June 6, 2005). In L 16, that is inside of the wall (L 15), we found a fireplace. Simultaneously we found another wall cross of South-East part of the trench (L 19). Both walls were built most likely from mud bricks, although it was difficult to follow their shape. Later on we could see their outlines (approximate length 0.35 m) in the North baulk underneath of the EB stone structure. The mud bricks were more clear outlined after removing L 19. At the beginning of excavating L 19 we thought that we have here another corner of other room but later on it became clear that we can_Ñét really see the corner and all what we had was just one part of the mud brick wall. In this context we had already Chalcolithic transitional ceramics. After removing the mud brick layer from the walls (L 15 and L 19) we went through short hiatus (L 20). Though we found a bronze needle at its elevation (572.55; see L 20: KT# 4). Underneath of the mud brick layer in the North-East part of the trench we reached a solid stone foundation (L 21), which East end was bonded to a very massive grounding stone (seeable dimension: length 0.40 m, width 0.40 m, height 0.30 m). At the same time was found another, but smaller, grounding stone in the South-West part of the trench. Assuming that the two grounding stones should bond one wall we tried to trace eventual remains on the line between these two grounding stones. Fortunately we found part of the wall, or wall foundation (L 27) exactly on the probable line between two grounding stones and this gave us the reason to assert the existence of the wall (although its bigger part was completely destroyed), forming a large room placed again diagonally (North-East/ South-West) in the trench. Two fireplaces (L 24 and L 28) in two following levels, and the plastered floor surface (L 29) were to confirm that this was the room or the house with long term use. Furthermore I think that the last stone wall foundation was reused in later time for building a smaller house, which was L 15, and inside space _ÑÐ L 16. At the level of L 26, related to the Late Chalcolichic Period, we found relatively small amount ceramics and no artifacts (except one loom weight found outside of the room: see L 23, KT# 8), which tells us that this place was in temporary use or left suddenly. After removing the remains of Late Chalcolithic stone wall foundation we were digging very mixed deposit without determinate structure over the course of last two days. We closed the trench under these conditions.    In general we had very little amount artifacts: four grinding stones from the upper levels (see L 6: KT# 14 and KT# 15, L 8: KT# 4, L 9: KT# 6), two bronze needles (see L 7: KT# 3 and L 20: KT# 4), one loom weight (see L 23: KT# 8), and one shell bit (see L 30: KT# 6) and one bone needle (see L 30: KT# 9) from the lowest level of the trench.   At the end of the excavating season we left no loci in excavating process. We closed the trench at two loci, L 25 and L 30, both as fill. Although we did not have any definite structure I would make some suggestion for next excavating season. In L 25 could be tracked out the bottom of the wall (L 19) and eventual floor surface associated with it. In L 30 is possible pit close to the west baulk (see closing up the trench photo from 6/22/2005). I really think it is worth!          .                               ,~: G-10-2005-06-023-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area G/Trench 10,"1378,2005-06-23," F-2-2005-06-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 2/Locus 2042,","   Daily Summary   Area F, Trench 2   June 23, 2005   M.

It is located 5 meters to the west of G7 and is oriented North/South on its long axis. The G8 sounding is also to the north of G9. The G9/G7 datum point is located north of the trenches, near the northern baulk of the G8 sounding. It is 579.57m above sea level. The trench was started new this season and reached a depth of 1.23m on the southern half, 2.25m on the northern half, and 3.67m for the sounding between the two. The G9 sounding is located in the northern half of the trench on the western baulk and the height difference between the northern and southern parts of the trench. This trench was placed here in an attempt to investigate the tepe occupation for that area. With various occupation levels found on the tepe itself and then farther down towards the Tigris River, it was our goal to trace occupation between these two areas. During the previous 2004 season G7 had been opened to begin this investigation. Trench G9 was an extension of that goal.      Description of Excavation   The excavation of G9 was started on May 16, 2005. After removing an initial layer of topsoil (L1), a stone wall stub (L2) was uncovered less than 10cm below the surface. Below this wall stub was fill and then below that was another possible stone associated to that feature (L11) was uncovered. Then below this locus was uncovered locus 13, a very compact surface containing cultural material.      A subsoil layer (L3) was then removed uncovering in the southern area of the trench an area of domestic refuse and usage. From this point on, the trench was arbitrarily divided into northern and southern halves. I will discuss the southern half first and then the northern.      Southern Section   Locus 4 was created to encompass the domestic fill because of the presence of two relatively complete pedestalled vessels found upturned, with other associated pottery fragments and faunal remains (KT G.9.4.1-2). In the same area of the trench, the top of an in situ tandur (oven) was uncovered (L7). The tandur was excavated like a pit, using a hand trowel and brushes, with an effort made to not disturb the feature itself. Loci 6 and 8 were removed as fill of the tandur. Locus 6 was the top portion of the fill and was divided from L8 by a layer of stones and broken pottery. The fill below this layer became locus 8. Soil and carbon samples were collected from both levels of fill. The tandur was preserved to almost its complete height during use. Once the base of the tandur was reached through L8, the exterior was excavated as subsoil fill locus 10. The tandur was photographed to its preserved height and the area around the exterior was removed as L10. There was no clear demarcation of a surface around the tandur.      A subsoil fill layer was removed as L15. A good amount of cultural material was found, but no clear contexts were uncovered until L16. L16 is a possible pebble feature/dump that was partially picked through along the southwestern baulk. This locus was originally selected for Household Archaeology Protocol (HAP) sample collection. A _ m2 area was laid out and removed to the base of what we thought was the surface at that point. The rest of the locus was removed, screened, and the volume was estimated at 612 liters when we stopped screening it. The locus was sampled based on this protocol, but was not collected to 100% completion. This is due partially to the original missing of the locus and picking through its northern boundary, but then also during the course of the excavation we began to question it actually being a surface rather than a pebble dump. Through excavation no breaks were found indicating multiple levels of surfaces, but it continued down in some places to a depth of approximately 40cm. After removal of the pebble matrix from L16, a compact bricky locus remained (L18) that appears to have built up at the same time as the pebble fill. It had a step-like appearance with the pebbles mounded up on top of it.      The last active locus for the southern half of the trench was subsoil fill removal for L15. Within this locus along the southeastern baulk was found two upturned cooking vessels (KT.G.9.15.32-33). At this point the excavation in the southern half of the trench was stopped and the focus turned to the northern section and the sounding.      Northern section   Subsoil locus 9 was removed in order to investigate the presence of good contexts.   At approximately the same depth as the domestic refuse from locus 4, were located two human burials along the eastern baulk of the trench. The first burial (L5) was removed completely, while the second (L17) was partially preserved in the baulk and remains there. For a detailed discussion of the L5 burial, see  entries for the day of May 23 as well as the second week of excavation for G9. The fill below the burial (L12) contained a great deal of charcoal flecks and some other cultural material. Directly to the south of the burial was found what is possibly a complete, but shattered, coarse ware cooking vessel. No other grave goods were found. The locus 17 burial was much less better preserved and both removal and examination were difficult. For brief notes on the burial from locus 17 see the daily  for May 29, 2005.      At this point locus 14 was removed as subsoil fill. Below this locus, in the northeast corner of the trench, a small ceramic vessel was uncovered containing approximately 100 beads of shell, rock crystal, and stone as well as one metal coil. Based on its corrosive properties, the coil was probably made from either silver or lead. For a detailed description of this cache, see daily  notes from June 1, 2005 and the small finds report for KT G.9.19.1-.62. This locus (L19) was discovered during the big pick removal of the L14 subsoil fill and was damaged during discover. The surrounding matrix was very hard and compact, making trowel excavation slow and difficult. An arbitrary 1m2 locus (L19) was created around the vessel to determine if there was any thing else associated with this cache of beads. This locus was excavated mainly by trowel but also by careful use of small pick when necessary due to the difficult nature of the surrounding soil. Nothing else was discovered related to the vessel, so L20 subsoil fill locus was created to continue excavation in that area. Within L20 a pit was uncovered (L21) and removed.      Due to the lack of cultural remains found in this portion of the trench at this depth, a sounding was placed in G9 to investigate the extent of occupation/use of this area. The sounding was placed at the juncture between the western baulk and the north/south break between the two halves of the trench. The first sounding locus removed was L22, but there was nothing of cultural importance found. Within the second sounding locus (L23) an interesting level containing a great deal of ash and burned material was uncovered. A partially broken vessel containing ash was removed from this locus (KT.G.9.23.4). The remaining sounding loci (L24, L25, L26, and L27) were comprised of a dense pebbly matrix with very little cultural remains. At this point both the sounding and the trench were stopped. We currently believe that this sort of pebble matrix is actually the equivalent to virgin soil found in other areas of the excavation. Due to geological processes that we do not completely understand at this point, we believe that this buildup of pebbly material was a natural occurrence and that there was no occupation or use of this area that can be investigated archaeologically at this time.      No baulks were drawn from trench G9 during the 2005 season. This trench was closed on June 7, 2005. The excavation of this trench allowed us to investigate the occupation of this particular area of Kenan Tepe and helped us to answer research goals related to the overall excavation of the site. But in and of itself, there was not a great amount of good contexts that were uncovered. Therefore our energies and attentions were focused elsewhere on the site.      Interpretation   The interpretive portion of this trench summary will begin at the earliest indication of occupation/use of this trench and move forwards in time to the most recent. The earliest evidence of use of this area by a human population comes from L23 the sounding locus with a thick layer of ash and the partially preserved ceramic vessel. This could have been a part of a cooking installation or some other domestic activity area. No other evidence of occupation/use was found here.      Then more recently was the bead cache (L19) found in the northeast corner of the trench. There was no visible pit or other cut into which this vessel was sunk, nor was there any evidence of a house or other feature associated with the vessel. Due to the vessel_Ñés placement close to the corner of the trench, it is possible that other associated archaeological remains are just outside the limits of the G9 trench, but there is no way of determining that at this point. We currently believe that the beads were stored for future retrieval, but for what ever reason were not returned for. This cache could have represented significant personal importance and/or monetary worth.      The third level of occupation/use for the G9 trench comes in the southern portion of the trench with the associated loci, 15 and 16. There was a good amount of domestic refuse here including the upturned cooking vessels which might represent cultural fill or trash dump. This could coincide with the curious pebble deposition of L16. The buildup over time of the pebbles and the associated bricky surface (L18) could represent a similar trash dumping area that was used over time creating this buildup of material.      Finally we come to the most recent level of occupation/use of this area, the tandur and associated fills (L6, 7, 8, and 10). This portion of the trench was used for food preparation activities, as represented by the clay oven (tandur) and other cultural remains found here. The other loci associated with this depth of occupation are the two burials (L5 and 17). These two burials may be associated with this same level of occupation/use or may be incursions cut into this level from a later time period. There was no definable pit for either burial. But the presence of the coarse ware vessel with the L5 burial suggests that this might have also been associated with the time period that the tandur was in use. Further investigation of the ceramics from both areas of use and of the carbon samples taken from both areas would be necessary before further hypotheses can be put forward.      Overall, this area of the tepe does not seem to have been extensively used in the past. Some cooking installations at different time periods were present as were the two burials and the bead cache, but no other domestic structures or features were uncovered.      Loose Ends   In future excavation activities related to G9, it might be helpful to draw the northern and perhaps eastern baulks of the trench. Especially in the northern portion of the trench there was a great deal of very hard and compact fill that was taken out primarily with big picks and shovels. At one point in the northern baulk it became clear that a possible floor or hard plaster surface was cut through, but there had not been any cultural remains associated with that feature so it was not discovered until seen in profile. None of the interesting features found in trench G7 were repeated in G9, such as the pithos burials or the short stone wall demarking a road. It is possible that these features continue in the 5m baulk between these two trenches, but this will not be known without further excavation.

Trench F22 is located to the south of trench F1, with no baulk left between the two. It has odd dimensions of roughly 6.7m E-W at its north end, 5.90m E-W at its south end, and 4m N-S. Its east side is uneven because it intersects the partially collapsed west baulk of trench F4. Our goal in opening this trench is to locate the southern wall of a room whose floor we found in trench F1 during the 2001 season. We found the eastern wall of this room in trench F19 and the western wall in trench F20. Finding the southern wall would help us define the space and understand its relationship to the rest of the structure. Marco Baldi excavated Loci 1, 2, 3, 4, and defined Locus 5. Andy Creekmore excavated Locus 5 and higher.    The stratigraphic layers in this trench can be briefly described as topsoil and subtopsoil plus occupational debris (dug as mixed locus 1) over a cobblestone surface (L2), over fill (L3), over cobblestone surface (fill) in the eastern half of the trench (L5) and mud fill (L7) in the western half of the trench. Beneath cobbles L5 and fill L7 we encountered a cobblestone surface filling the southern 2/3 of the trench (L8), and mudbrick debris in the northern third of the trench (L9). These two loci, L8 and L9, covered several walls: L11, 16, 17, 21, and 22. Walls L17, 21 and 22 are abutted by a plaster surface L19 that wraps up onto the north face of these walls. In our attempt to define these walls, we dug Locus 10 over walls L11 and L16, L9 over walls L17, 21 and 22 (and north of wall L17) and L15 as the last bit of debris over surface L19. Locus 10 and parts of L9 are therefore the tops of the walls themselves. We only dug Locus 12, the fill south of walls L11 and L16, in a small area in the SW corner of the trench.    Several pits cut the other loci in F22. Pit Locus 4 cut from locus 2 through locus 5, 17, and 20 at the NE corner of the trench. This pit is visible in the west section drawing of trench F4. Pit locus 14, located in the NW quarter of the trench, was first seen below locus 7 but probably cut locus 7, as well as locus 9 and 15. It also cut the southern end of trench F20, L11, a wall. We caught this pit late, as well as pit Locus 18, because they were both mostly within a baulk left between trenches F22 and F20. After removing the baulk the outline of Locus 14 and 18 became clearer. Locus 18 cut locus 2, 3, 9 and surface 19. It is round and we did not finish excavating it this season. Its section can be seen in the photographs of the west baulk. Lastly, pits L6 and L13 are intersecting pits that contained the buried remains of two individuals. These are discussed separately below.       Burials in pits Locus 6 and 13:       NOTE: THERE IS A SECOND, _ÑÉB_Ñé DAY PLAN ON JUNE 14 AND 15 THAT CONTAINS SKETCHES OF THE LOCATIONS OF SELECTED BONES AS THEY WERE REMOVED.       Pit Locus 13 is the larger disturbed area that may have been created during the original burial of individual 1. Pit Locus 6, which stretched the disturbance further to the west, may have resulted from the burial of individual two. The burials consisted of individual 1 (I1), interred first, and individual two (I2), added at a later time. I1 is a nearly complete articulated skeleton, including the right arm, wrist, and hand, some ribs, the pelvis, both legs and the right foot. This individual is lying on its back with its legs flexed and knees rolled to the left, or north. The knees stuck up in the air considerably, perhaps confined to a small pit, and were clipped a bit by baulk cutting/erosion in F1. The left arm was found out of proper position, below and around the cranial vault, which was also displaced.    It seems likely that the sequence of events that formed L6 occurred as follows: I1 was interred within a pit. Later I2 was being buried when the diggers disturbed burial one_Ñés left arm and skull. They placed these bones, along with those of I2, on top of and beside the skull of individual one. I2 was either disarticulated to begin with, or buried in a very tightly compacted flexed position. The former seems more likely because most or all of its mandible is missing, along with its pelvis, wrist, ankle and toes. Only a small piece of a mandible was found and without further analysis we cannot say if it belongs to I1 or I2. The crania of I1 and I2 were found lying back to back, the top of each head to the SW, with crania 1 (to the east) facing SE, and crania 2 (to the west) facing NW. The atlas (1st) vertebra was found stuck to crania 1.    We found a bronze (?) pin near the pelvis of I1 (but some 10cm higher) but is likely dislocated from its original position. During its recovery we bent the tip of the pin (L6, KT1). It has a ball head, is pierced below the head, and has a considerable weight. Both I1 and I2 are adults although we have not yet made any determination of sex or age.    It is my feeling that these burials date no later than the Middle Bronze Age, and are probably Early Bronze Age. The pin should help bracket the time of burial. These burials may be contemporary with those found in F1 and excavated as L1021A/B. Those burials were also interred one on top of the other, the latter disturbing the former, and they also contained grave goods consisting of a pot and perhaps a spindle whorl (the whorl may not belong to the burial). Spatially the F1 and F22 burials were very close together, have only about 20cm difference in their elevation, and they are oriented along the same E-W axis. It is possible that the F1 L1021 A/B and F22 L6 burials were intentionally placed in/over the room formed by the walls found in F19, F20 and F22.       NOTE: we found a lithic, L6 KT4, just east of and adjacent to the right arm (radius/ulna) of Individual 1. This lithic appears to be an unmodified flake and could derive from the burial fill, but given its location it could also be a grave good. A juglet was found in nearly the same position in F1 burial L1021.       NOTE: all the bones for individual 1 and individual 2 were given Locus 6, KT 1 because of the mixing of bones near the head of individual 1. During a future inventory of the skeletons the bones of individual two should be given a new KT number.       Architectural Summary/ Interpretation of F22:       My current interpretation of the architecture in F22 is that abutting, E-W walls L11 and L17 formed a double wall, perhaps for two abutting structures. In the eastern baulk (west baulk of F4) the visible foundations of L17, L20, abut the north face of L11, indicating that L17 was built after L11. It may have been built later in the same week or year or later over a longer period. My feeling is that L17 was built not long after L11. Walls L16 and L21 are also E-W abutting walls that continue the path of L11 and L17. The space between L17 and L21 is filled or blocked by a wall stub, L22, which forms a passageway with the southern end of the F20 wall, L11. Locus 22 may have blocked another passageway from the south, or it_Ñés apparent separation from L17 and 21 may simply reflect architectural practices. The baked mud plaster surface L19 connects F20 L11 to F22 L17, 21 and 22 because it wraps up onto the southern face of F20 L11 and the north face of the F22 walls. This surface is the same one found in F1 during the 2001 season, and in F19 this season.    After the walls L11, 16, 17, 21 and 22 were in ruin (perhaps collapsing in part into trenches F1 and F19), a fill of cobblestones, L8, was placed over these walls and fill L12 to the south. It is clear that L8 was an intentional fill because it is thicker to the south, over L12, which would have been more deflated then the nearly two meter thick, solid brick walls to the north. That is, the fillers had to put a thicker layer of cobblestones in the south to fill in the depressed area but not so many above the stubs of the walls L11, 16, and such. The relative lack of cultural material in L8 suggests that it was a _ÑÉclean_Ñé fill of cobblestones brought from the river bed or eroding layers on the river bank, rather the scavenged from around the inhabited area.    The source of loci 2, 3, 5, and 7 may have been additional attempts to fill in the area or to create activity surfaces to go with new structures yet to be discovered.

The datum is the southwestern corner of C4 and is 597.16 meters above sea level. This is a 5x5m trench and it abuts C4 on its eastern baulk. This trench was last excavated during the 2003 season, but had also been previously excavated by Pete. I excavated this trench in the 2003 season, so I was well acquainted with its loci and contexts. The trench was started on June 7, 2005 after the first half of the season I had spent excavating trench G9. C1 was started at a depth of 595.35m above sea level and went down to 594.51m, and was therefore taken down 84cm. Previous excavations in area C point to this part of the tepe having been occupied in the Bronze Age. This season, much of the excavation focus was on areas showing evidence of Late Chalcolithic and _ÑÉUbaid occupations. C1 was reopened this season to help balance out the research focus and to create a more holistic picture of occupation at the site. This is also why the C2 sounding was opened. Based on the pottery reading conducted this season, it seems that area C, at least with C1 and C2, is firmly entrenched in the Bronze Age. C1 may have reached back to the Early Bronze (EB), but there is no evidence of us moving closer to Late Chalcolithic occupation evidence on this part of the tepe.      Excavation of C1   The first locus opened in the 2005 excavation of trench C1 is L1102, a cleaning locus. The goal of this locus was to clean up the compressed areas affected by the plastic laid down at the end of the 2003 excavation season. As always happens in this trench, interesting finds were made without any clear context. A nice example of a stone tool was found (KT C.1.1102.15) while removing back fill.      The beginning of the excavation was focused on initially attempting to clean up evidence from previous loci and to determine the presence of new loci. At first I thought that the walls, etc. from the 2003 season were finished, and new loci were created to equal the older loci as they were cleaned up and removed. L1106 was created to equal L1092, which was originally thought to have been a short wall or windbreak to protect a cooking installation. This locus continued down for two rows and was removed, but it continues into the northern baulk, so its full extent is not known. L1103 was created to equal the stone wall 1069 in the eastern baulk. L1104 was created to equal what had been described as a mud brick surface or foundation trench (L1071) in the middle of C1. Similarly L1105 was created to equal L1083 the mud brick foundation to L1069 stone wall. Approximately 10cm from each of these loci (L1104 and L1105) and then an arbitrary cleaning locus (L1107) was created to finish the initial removal of approximately 20cm. At this point I finally realized that what I had originally mistaken as a foundation to a stone wall, was in fact a mud brick wall. Better late than never. So new loci were started again to correctly deal with the mud brick walls. L1110 became the eastern mud brick wall, so L1105 was closed and divided into two areas to cover both the wall and the fill to the east of it. L1114 was created to encompass the fill on the eastern side of that wall. L1111 became the western wall that runs through the center of the trench. At the end of the season when these walls were finally traced to their extents and removed, a good amount of cultural remains were removed from each. Two of the more special finds from wall 1110 were an interesting worked sherd disk that might have served as a lid (KT C.1.1110.6) and a straight ball-headed bronze pin (KT C.1.1110.7). A similar bronze pin (KT C.1.1111.12) was recovered from the removal of wall 1111.      During the 2003 excavation season, there had been an elevation difference between the western and eastern halves of the trench. This problem was revisited in the 2005 season. Cleaning locus 1108 was therefore created to deal with the western half of the trench which was lower than the eastern half (L1107).      Through the removal of L1107 cleaning locus for the eastern portion of the trench (between mud brick walls 1111 and 1110), a plastered surface (L1109) was uncovered between the two walls. This surface extended between the two walls and was approximately 1.5m in width. The plaster did not cover the entire surface, but was constrained to a roughly 1m circular patch in the approximate center of the surface. This surface was removed using Household Archaeology Protocol (HAP) sampling procedures, and the actual HAP sample itself was taken from the plastered area. At least one large chert core (KT C.1.1109.8) was removed, as well as a good deal of lithic material. This portion of the trench also contained a good amount of slag (KT C.1.1109.11), which Lynn believes was from an over-fired pottery kiln. No kiln has been found in this trench, so the kiln must have been located elsewhere on the tepe. One of the most remarkable finds from this surface, however, is a coarse ware sherd impressed by a cylinder seal (KT C.1.1109.14). This sherd was taken as a small find and has been photographed and drawn. The seal impression has been possibly recreated as well, and might depict a \birdman\ figure as well as a monster killing a stag. Parallels with other sites are necessary to make further investigations into this find.      Loci 1112 and 1113 were created as fill loci to remove material from around the mud brick walls. These loci were later combined since there did not seem to be the need to have separate loci for fill on both sides of the walls. L1115 may also have some overlap with L1113. L1115 was located along the middle area of the eastern baulk. It was comprised of very hard and compact bricky areas. This could have been some sort of brick collapse from wall 1110 or from both walls, but few whole bricks were visible. Because of the difference in consistencies, this locus was taken out as a separate entity.      L1116 was a stone arc located on the exterior of the southwestern end of wall 1111. This may have been a pit cut into lower contexts from above, but there was no evident pit line. The inside fill of the arc was removed as L1119. We think this might be something that cut into lower levels, since the pottery from L1119 appears to be Middle Bronze when other loci at the same level or slightly higher seemed to indicate an earlier date of occupation. The stone arc (L1116) contained an almost complete vessel profile (KT C.1.1116.2), multiple pieces of the same broken basalt grinding stone (KT C.1.1116.4), as well as a small ground stone door socket (KT C.1.1116.5).      L1118 was started as a fill locus, but then was closed before any excavation could be done. I decided that there was a better way to proceed. Instead L1120 was created as a fill locus since it was below the level of loci 1116 and 1119 (stone arc and fill). This locus (L1120) was also used to clean the top of surface 1117.      When originally found, L1117 pebble surface was thought to be the earliest level of use for the mud brick walls 1111 and 1110. It started at the break line where L1109 plaster surface had stopped and continued northwards abutting both walls and reaching the northern baulk. The surface was removed using HAP sampling protocols. As we were straightening and cleaning up the locus after removal, I noticed that the pottery and stones from L1117 continued underneath wall 1111. I had already suspected that we had proceeded below the extent of the walls, but had not yet attempted to remove them. This was the last proof that I needed. Also, in L1120 on the western side of wall 1111 there had started to come up more pebble surface, which appeared to be the same surface as that removed on the eastern side of the walls. So L1117 pebble surface was in existence before the construction of mud brick walls 1111 and 1110. There must have been at least 5cm of fill above the pebble surface (1117) and then the walls were constructed on top of that. So the walls were removed and L1120 was used to clean up the surface on the western side of the trench. Then what remained of surface 1117 was again sampled using HAP methods.      This was the last act of excavation that was conducted in C1 at the end of the season. The trench was closed on June 23, 2005. The baulks were not drawn from this season. The trench was taken down to below the walls and below the pebble surface and was then back filled for the possibility of further excavation.      Interpretation   The earliest level in C1 excavated this season is pebble surface 1117. This surface was below wall 1111 and was bounded on the western side of the trench by two large stones. There is a space between the stones that might have marked access to the area.      Then there was a layer of fill (L1120).      This was followed by the construction of the mud brick walls 1111 and 1110. Through the many uses of these walls, they seem to have been often used for domestic purposes. The earliest use of the two walls (L1111 and L1110) appears to be the plastered surface (L1109). This surface covered half the length of the space between the two walls. These walls were previously excavated in the 2003 field season as well as earlier. Another context that would be interesting to revisit as to the use of these walls was from the 2003 season in which an in situ pot smash was found against wall 1111 (different locus then) and possibly in connection with the small wall (now L1106) that has been described as a wind break. After their use as mud brick walls they were later reused as stone walls. For more information on this period of their use, see notes and summaries from the 2003 season.     ,~dc-terms:title: C-1-2005-06-026-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 1,"1384,2005-06-26," C-2-2005-06-026-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,","C-2-2005   Final Trench Summary, Year 2005 Season   Area C   Sounding 2   June 26, 2005         Introduction   This arbitrary 1m2 sounding was sunk into the southwest corner of Trench C2 to investigate the extent of occupation through time on the western side of the tepe. The datum point is the C4 southwestern corner and is 597.16m above sea level. While the 5x5m C1 trench appears to be late 3rd millennium BC, we wished to explore whether or not earlier occupations, such as the _ÑÉUbaid and Late Chalcolithic found elsewhere on the tepe, also exist here. This sounding has been excavated by two people this season, Jeanne Nijhowne and myself (Marie Marley). I began the first locus (2163) of the sounding, Jeanne took over for her last week and then I took over again from her. The sounding was started at the final depth of C2 after the 2003 season, which was 595.84 meters above sea level. The final locus (2182) is 592.33 meters above sea level, and therefore makes the sounding approximately 3.5m deep.      Excavation of the Sounding   Sounding locus 2163 was removed as a cleaning locus since it was directly below the plastic laid down at the base of C2 at its closing after the 2003 season. JN then took over the woundng and the following is based on her locus sheets for loci 2164 _ÑÐ 2171.      A mud brick wall was uncovered in L2164, but there is no other information about it relating to height or courses. Further information from baulk drawings is necessary to establish accurate dimensions. L2165 contained a great deal of ash and ashy deposits. Some cultural material was also recovered. L2166, 2167, 2168, and 2169 were generall fill loci. L2167 contained a small bronze pin (KT C.2.2167.7). In L2170 there appeared to be a change in soil consistency and an olive green brick was recorded. The soil is very wet in the sounding, so it was difficult at times to notice consistency changes during excavation. L2171 consisted of more general cultural fill. This locus was not finished by the end of JN_Ñés final day of excavation, so I took it over halfway through and then finished the excavation of the sounding on June 23, 2005.      Due to the confining nature of the 1m2 sounding, the only tools able to be used for excavation were the small pick and the hand trowel. The small pick was generally used for the purposes of loosening the soil and then the trowel was used for articulating features and scraping down loci.      During the removal of fill locus 2172, a single course stone wall was uncovered. Through further investigation, this stone wall was determined to be a stone boundary to a tricolor mud brick wall (L2173). After examining the southern, western, and northern baulks, it was found that the wall had cut through the western side of the sounding on a roughly north-south axis and had been preserved to a height of approximately 1m. In the western baulk, it is also evident that the wall was cut by a pit. The wall is comprised of three colors of mud brick: green, brown and red. This is similar to a tri-color mud brick wall found in Area I. This wall (L2173) is thought to have been associated with domestic usage rather than functioning as a city wall. The stone boundary (2174) based on its limited height, but also the stones were aligned in such a way as they were made to create a relatively smooth line on the western side abutting the mud brick wall (2173) and a rougher outline facing away from the wall. Also associated with this stone boundary were smaller stones and pebbles balanced on top of the medium sized cobbles. The earth directly over the stone boundary was a deep red color, similar to the red bricks and this could have been in place over the stone boundary to help keep these smaller stones. Further excavation of this feature in the C2 trench is necessary. On the eastern side of this mud brick wall and stone boundary was fill (L2175). Also associated with the wall/boundary combination is a small pebble/pottery surface (2177). This surface was only present in this sounding to a small extent and was therefore not able to be sampled using the Household Archaeology Protocol (HAP). In the southern baulk it is evident that this surface ran up to and stopped at the L2174 stone boundary.      Below the stone boundary/mud brick wall combination (L2174/2173) was a thin layer of fill, that might have been a mud brick layer since two green bricks were noticed beneath the stone boundary. Below that layer of fill was a four course stone foundation (L2176) that covered the majority of the base of the sounding. Below 2176 was the fill locus 2178 and within 2178 a secondary single course stone feature (L2179) was uncovered. L2179 is directly aligned with the third course of the stone foundation (L2176) and with the original single course stone boundary (L2174).      The final three sounding loci (L2180, L2181, and L2182) did not reveal any other architectural remains or significant cultural fill. L2180 did have a good amount of charcoal flecks in the matrix and there was an area of pebble buildup in the eastern baulk, but there was not enough present in the sounding to determine if this was a pebble surface or not. That could be explored more in the future through excavation of trench C2.      The western baulk of the C2 sounding was drawn, but has not yet been evaluated.      Interpretation   The main focus of the interpretation of this sounding is on the stone boundary and mud brick wall (2173 and 2174) features and their construction. We believe that this wall (L2173) is related to domestic structures as opposed to being a part of the city wall, which is significantly larger and located approximately 10m down the hill from C2. The single course stone feature (L2179) as the earliest architectural structure uncovered in the sounding is not yet understood in the larger context of the trench. The stone foundation (L2176) is easier to explain as a foundation for the mud brick wall and stone boundary. The surface (L2177) was related to this structure and based on the surface abutting the stone boundary, suggests that this could have been the internal area of the space being divided. Further excavation in the trench would be necessary before other hypotheses could be made.      Future excavations of this trench will hopefully be through excavating the larger C2 and therefore most of the problems of excavating a sounding, namely the small nature of the exposure created, will be solved. It would also be helpful to get a better recording and understanding of the mud brick wall mentioned in L2164. Otherwise, every locus described here continues into either the northern or eastern baulks which are within the C2 trench area. The southern baulk moves towards C3, which also has been unexcavated since 2003, and the western baulk leads towards the western base of the tepe and the sounding containing the city wall.     ,~: C-2-2005-06-026-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area C/Trench 2,"1385,2005-06-26," F-7-2005-06-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,","   Weekly Trench Summary   Area F, Trench 7   C. Painter      Week 6      This week involved work mostly concerned with surfaces within the trench, notably in the eastern half of the trench. These included compacted surface 7208 located west of pit 7181, mud plastered surface 7213 which was found to be cut by pit 7181 on its western side and possibly associated with surface 7208 (though varying in elevation), and mud plaster floor 7219 located in the center of fill 7211.       This floor was found to have evidence for burning along with a plastered \fire pit\ area in the center of the locus, an in situ door socket made from the reuse of a basalt grinding stone fragment that was sunk into the plaster in the northeast edge of the floor, and the pedestal portion of a large pedestalled bowl with curved lip on the base was found lying directly on top of the surface south of the central pit.      Another surface that was excavated was located in the northwest corner of the trench, locus 7220 that was found abutting the northern face of wall 7202. All these surfaces were excavated using the Household Archaeology Protocol.      Other features that were uncovered included two separate sherd-lined pits (7206 and 7218) that could possibly be pot stands and further examination within mud brick feature 7183 revealed the presence of a pit cutting into the center of this locus that was designated as locus 7221. This pit turned out to contain a human burial of an adult individual in a flexed position with no associated grave goods.     ,~: F-7-2005-06-26-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,"1386,2005-07-02," F-7-2005-07-02-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7,","F-7-2005   Kenan Tepe   Final Trench Summary 2005   Area F, Trench 7   July 2, 2005   C.Painter      Introduction   Area F is located in the \lower town\ area of the site due east of the main mound. Within this area, trench 7 is located north of trench F9 and west of trench F2, with this overall clustering of trenches lying approximately 10 meters north of trenches F1 and F4.. F7 measures 9.3 x 9.8 meters and was roughly 1.5 meters deep when I began excavation. The F1 datum point (570.64) was used for the entirety of the season for all elevations. The trench had been previously excavated in three different seasons (2001, 2002, 2004), therefore the goals for this season were to remove any loci that were left open from the 2004 season and to excavate down and expose more Late Chalcolithic/EBA architecture that was initially reached last year.       Before work began in earnest, it was necessary to locate, renumber, and excavate key loci from the 2004 season. These loci included a rectangular pebble surface located in the southeast corner of the trench that was not given a locus number last season (new locus 7138), an oval trampled pebble surface located in the center of the trench (old locus 7134, new locus 7141), and a stone feature with two parallel lines of 10-20cm cobbles in the southwest corner of the trench (old locus 7133, new locus 7140). Two pits (7103 and 7127) that were excavated in 2004 were also still present at the start of this season, therefore these features, along with several uneven fill areas in the northwest corner of the trench (7131 and 7121/7135) where the primary focus of leveling activities that were initially undertaken once the renumbering of loci was completed.       Due to the size of the trench, it was decided to subdivide the trench into four quadrants in order to have better control over the excavation of areas, especially when new features were to arise. The southwest quadrant of the trench was assigned locus 7139 and encompassed loci 7128 and 7129 from the 2004 season. The northwest quadrant was assigned locus 7142 and encompassed fill loci 7131 and 7121/7135 and pit 7127. The northeast quadrant of the trench was assigned as locus 7145 and encompassed old loci 7103 (pit), 7122 (fill), 7126 (fill), 7132 (fill), 7136 (pit), and 7137 (pit). Finally, the southeast quadrant of the trench was assigned as locus 7149 and encompassed old fill locus 7126.       In the process of leveling the entire trench by a combination of big and small picking, a small circular pit surrounded by a ring of ash (old locus 7137, new locus 7143) was excavated with trowels along with another small pit (7144) that was composed of heavily compacted burnt pot sherds. This latter pit had been cut by the excavation of locus 7103 from last season, so it is impossible to know the exact dimensions of this pit. What is clear is that this pit and associated sherd cluster is most likely related to locus 7147, a circular ashen surface with a 12cm diameter pit or divot off center that was found directly below 7144.                Excavation   Work in F7 this season revealed a number of important features that can be divided into four groups: burials, walls, surfaces, and pits. These groups will be discussed separately and interpretation given to how these features interrelate with one another in both space and time (i.e. stratigraphically).      Burials   A total of four burials were excavated this season, surprisingly each one coming from a different quadrant of the trench. In each case, metal dental picks and medium-stiffness small brushes were used in articulation and excavation taking great care not to scratch the surface of the bones. Individual parts of the body (i.e. left arm, right collar bone) were collected and identified separately as best as possible given the circumstances of preservation of the bones. In two cases (7150 and 7200), disarticulation of the burial and poor preservation of the bones led to a less-than-adequate excavation of the burial whereby only a small number of bones were identifiable and the rest were included within a \miscellaneous bones\ foil package.       For all burials a screening ratio of 1:1 was employed and a 1mm sieve was used. Any cultural materials that were recovered directly from the burial or within the sieve were combined into a single pottery KT, lithic KT, etc. for that specific locus. In general, very little cultural material was found within any of the burials and overall included small diagnostic and mostly non-diagnostic sherds, separate animal bone, almost no lithics, and carbon.       The first burial (7148) that was excavated was located in the northwest corner of the trench cutting fill loci 7142 and 7155. The primary burial (KT3) was that of an adult individual in an extended position on his/her back with head on the eastern side of the locus facing north and the body going west toward the west baulk. Only half of the body was present/preserved from the base of the rib cage to the skull. Below the rib cage, aggressive scraping totaling in a 15-20 cm deep cut was performed in order to trace the lower extremities of the body in case, either due to erosional factors or primary positioning of the body, the leg and pelvic bones were laying at an increasingly sharp angle to the rest of the body. This turned out to not be the case.      Based on what remains, the individual seems to have been buried in an extended position on his/her back with both arms bent at the elbows and hands resting on the collarbone and upper sternum. The arms were not crossed over the chest but instead bent directly up to the head with the right hand resting on the right collar bone, etc. and the left resting on the left side (Note: \left\ and  ight\ are from the point of view of the observer and not the buried individual). It should be noted that preservation of the arm in this position was present only on the right side. In the absence of the arm on the left side, this bent arm position is evident by preservation of the finger and wrist bones resting on the left collarbone, rib cage, etc.       It was also observed that the skull and portions of the shoulder and collarbone were resting on a burn layer and/or surface which possibly extended to include the entire body resting on this surface that could have been cut during excavation. This burn layer is also visible in the north section profile of this locus. Interestingly none of the skeletal material was burnt, suggesting that this burial was a later addition to an already present surface.      The second burial (7150) was located along the southern edge and within fill L7145 and cutting mud brick wall 7160 (see below). This burial proved to be extremely disturbed/damaged and was essentially divided into two parts: a northern grouping of fragmentary unidentifiable bones most probably scattered by hand pick excavation in this area (thus nothing was found in situ) and a southern grouping which had an in situ cluster of long bones (arms?), fingers, and a fragmentary shoulder blade. All skeletal material was included within a single KT(2).      The long bones were found tightly packed together along with ribs suggesting a crouched or flexed positioning of the body. Exact orientation or sex/age of the individual however was unavailable. The long bone cluster was found cutting the northern edge of wall 7160 and resting on what appears to be a white lime or mud plastered surface which is extremely fragmentary. It could also have been mortar between courses for the mud brick wall.       Between burials 7148 and 7150 there is an elevation difference of 20cm for the upper levels and 30cm for the basal levels. In general, this difference is not too significant, however in light of the fact that there are no surfaces or walls or other features that directly connect the two burials in spatial respects, it would be extremely difficult to say without doubt that the two burials are related in time. Furthermore the relative lack of pottery within each of the burial pits makes stratigraphic relationships between these loci even more difficult. However the fact that these burials are distinctly associated with separate surfaces and/or walls in their own right will be important for tying these burials with larger features within the trench.      The third burial (7200) was excavated later in the season in the southwest quadrant of the trench where it was found below fill 7173, cutting fill 7207 and directly abutting pit 7199 on the northern side of the burial. The burial contained the skeleton of a single individual, most probably a small child based on the size of the body and the development of the teeth. The burial was set inside an ovoid pit that was lined on the north, east, and south sides by a single course of mud bricks (three unburnt bricks total), whose level of preservation was medium to poor.       Articulation of the body was especially difficult as the bones would flake and/or disintegrate upon light brushing. What was determined was that the burial contained a skull with intact teeth, part of the spinal column vertebrae, and what is perhaps the rib bones. The lower section of the individual was either not interned or was not preserved. The teeth were collected in a separate foil envelope. The rest of the bones were in such a fragmentary state that they were lumped into a \miscellaneous bones\ envelope. Both bone bags were labeled under one KT (KT1). Additionally one of the three mud bricks which were found to line the pit was taken for a flotation sample.       Last, the fourth burial (7221) was discovered at the very end of the season inside a mud brick feature (7183) located in the southeast corner of the trench that had initially been designated as a solid platform. Only from later examination was this platform found to contain a rectangular pit that was cutting the center of the mud brick feature and contained a human burial at its basal levels. At this point, the burial was emerging from the eastern baulk, therefore it was decided to excavate a portion of the eastern baulk which separates trench F7 from F2 in order to excavate the entirety of the burial. This was accomplished with large pick axes where a section 35cm to the north and south of platform 7183 was removed down to roughly 5cm above the top level of pit 7221. From here, hand trowels were used to come down on top of the burial at which point finer articulation with dental picks and brushes was performed.       The burial itself was composed of an adult male, based on the size of the pelvis, in a flexed position on the left side running in an east-west orientation (Note: \left\ and  ight\ orientation is based on the point of view of the buried individual and not of the excavator/observer as for burial 7148). The right leg and foot were resting on top of the left leg and foot. The right arm was resting on the left forearm. The left hand was found near the skull which faced to the south. Some pottery sherds were recovered near the body but no obvious grave goods. A carbon sample was recovered from the fill just above the hands.       Upon excavation of the burial, it was determined that the pit did not actually cut the mud bricks, but instead the bricks appeared to have been lining this burial. This does not disregard the fact that feature 7183 could have been initially used for other purposes and only later was a burial placed inside of it. However, this earlier function is not entirely clear as evidence for burning or fire (characteristics that might equate with an oven) apart from some residual ash and fire-cracked pebbles were not present inside the feature, nor were any other cultural materials or distinguishing characteristics of the mud brick feature itself conducive to functional interpretation other than use in this burial. The presence of thoroughly burnt mud bricks on both the western and eastern side of 7183 (locus 2029 in trench F2) suggest however that some kind of firing incident/activity did occur here at some point, but only on the upper course of brick as the lower two courses were completely unburned.      Walls   Several mud brick walls were excavated this season throughout all quadrants of the trench. In most cases, the walls were composed of only a single course of bricks (exceptions do occur, see below) with anywhere from 7-15 rows depending on the length of the entire feature. No stone foundations were uncovered that could be directly associated with any wall, though as will be discussed below, a pebble surface and three to four larger cobbles (7159) found running below wall 7159 might be considered foundational elements.      The initial walls to be uncovered were that of 7158 and 7160, located in the southeast quadrant of the trench. It was originally thought that locus 7157 was a third wall running in a east-west direction connected with the southern end of 7158. This assessment was later found to be false and 7157 was changed to a fill locus. 7158 was a two course mud brick wall with seven to eight rows running in a north-south direction which terminated in the south at 30-40 cm \foundational\ stones. The top most course of brick was extremely thin and upon its removal, was found to be resting on a second course of bricks that appeared to be burnt on top.       7160 was a one to two, possibly three, course mud brick wall with relatively shallow depth (thickness) and eight to nine rows of brick. It was initially unclear whether 7160 met 7158 at a corner, however it may be safely assumed that this was the case. The possibility for a doorway in this area as opposed to a corner is unlikely based on the fact that the western end of wall 7160 was found to be associated with a door socket from fill 7152 (KT4) and trampled pebble surface 7169. Unfortunately this surface was not discovered throughout the rest of the \inside context\ fill locus 7156 which either means it was missed, the surface was not well preserved in this fill area, or 7156 was never an \inside context\ at all but instead an outside, unpaved area.    Once this \structure\ composed of walls 7158, 7160 and surface 7169 was removed (including subwall fill 7175, 7176 and subsurface fill 7171 respectively), another series of mud brick walls were uncovered almost immediately. This serves as a direct reflection of multiple building phases within this southeast quadrant of the trench. The new walls can be considered definitely as a \structure\ since they are all interconnecting, in most cases at right angles. In this respect, a single locus was assigned (7178) and encompassed a total of four wall extensions (labeled A through D on the June 13, 2005 day plan) that formed a set of twin \magazine-type\ rooms in the center of the eastern half of the trench. The orientation of this building varies from that of walls 7158 and 7160.       The exact function of this building (whether domestic, commercial, or storage) cannot be determined with certainty based on the \clean\ fill loci (7177, 7179, 7180) that were excavated and lack of any surfaces within the rooms. The suggestion of storage purposes is offered based on the relative narrowness of the rooms (roughly a meter in both cases) and the lack of any permanent installations such as hearths, smelting areas, or other domestic and/or commercial features.      Though a difference of ten to fifteen centimeters can be seen in elevations between 7178 and adjacent wall stub 7187, platform 7183, and plaster-lined bin 7186 it can be hypothesized that all these mud brick features are associated stratigraphically to encompass some type of small-scale building complex within the eastern half of the trench composed of a series of inside storage-sized rooms and outside workspaces in fill 7177 and 7173. As will be discussed below, this can also include pit 7181 whose topmost elevations which were taken from a compacted mud layer sealing the pit and roughly equal to that of the surrounding wall features.       The same associations, at least based on elevations, can be drawn with a complex of walls and surfaces discovered in the northwest corner of the trench and excavated over several weeks. The mud brick walls included 7154 and 7163, both composed of a single course with a range from eight to ten rows of brick. In the case of 7163, a core of reddish brown bricks were flanked on the northern and western sides by a single even course of white brick. On the bottom, the wall was found to be resting on a burnt layer that was visible inside the west section for pit 7162 (see below). Clear brick lines were visible for 7163 in which a white or grayish mortar was employed.      Unlike building 7178, which showed no signs of burning or destruction, both 7154 and 7163 were sealed by a thick debris layer (7153, 7161, 7164) that was visible within the north baulk section directly connecting the tops of 7154 and 7163. These layers of debris included heavy ash, mud brick slump, and in some cases (7161) whole mud bricks that had been heavily burnt. Fortunately this destruction aided the preservation of several superimposed floors that lay beneath (to be discussed below).      Returning now to building 7178, only one more wall was uncovered directly below the subwall fill (7195) as evidence for a third rebuilding phase. This wall (7210) was oriented in an east-west direction parallel with pit 7181 and was composed of coarse-textured brick with pebble inclusions. This wall was found to be associated only with one other feature- a poorly-preserved trampled pebble surface (7208) that abutted 7210 on its northern and northwestern face.       Lastly a series of walls which can loosely be associated through elevational similarities are 7201 located in the southwest corner of the trench abutting fill 7204 and 7207, wall 7202 in the northwest corner of the trench cut by pit 7162 on its eastern side and associated with surface 7220 on its northern face, long wall 7209 that bends at a corner on its northern end, and short wall stub 7212 located in the northeast quadrant of the trench that was found to abut plaster surface 7219 on its southern face.       Unfortunately the great distances between these unconnecting walls makes interpretation of their function within the greater area of the trench difficult. Based on the presence of floor 7219, this area maybe considered an \inside\ context involving walls 7209 and 7212. The abutting of floor 7220 with 7202 also draws attention to the fact that this wall may be involved with a building context. Information regarding features associated with wall 7201 however is severely lacking, unless one considers that based on elevational similarities, burial 7200 and pit 7199 (to be discussed below) are stratigraphically linked, though not directly abutting one another.      Surfaces/floors   Fortunately this season revealed a plethora of floors and surfaces within the trench and many were found to either be abutting or bonded to mud brick walls. In most cases, the Household Archaeology Protocol (HAP) was enabled for excavation of these surfaces and included a selected 50 x 50cm HAP sample area that was recovered in toto along with measurement in liter-marked buckets of the remainder of the surface and collection of a soil sample if possible (Note: in some cases this season a floatation sample was not able to be collected because the mud plastering of the surface did not allow for any loose soil matrix).       Overall these loci can be divided into two categories: trampled/compacted pebble surfaces and compacted mud/mud plastered floors. The first group included surface 7159 that, as discussed above, was found to run below wall 7158 in the southeast quadrant of the trench. Though not directly abutting, this compacted pebble surface can be confidently associated with surface 7166 that was excavated using the HAP within fill locus 7156. In either case, the amount of cultural material pressed into these surfaces was minimal and included mostly broken pot sherds. Unfortunately these surfaces were not found to be bonded or abutting walls 7158 or 7160 which are in the direct vicinity. It is most probably the case that these surfaces and walls are not stratigraphically linked in that the surfaces are from an later occupation of the area.      Another trampled pebble surface that was discussed earlier is 7169, which was found to be abutting (it is not entirely clear whether or not the surface was bonded) wall 7160. 7169 was also noted to be directly abutting a door socket from fill 7152 located directly north of 7160. Interestingly, a second door socket was found below and slightly east of the topmost socket within the same fill locus (7152) suggesting multiple building phases not necessarily for the mud brick walls, but perhaps associated with the rebuilding of floors within this same structure. Unfortunately a second trampled surface below 7169 was not detected.      A final pebbled surface that was excavated using the HAP was 7208 located north of wall 7209 and northwest of wall 7210. Though overall this surface was not well preserved, areas that showed clear compaction of pebbles and small pot sherds were found to be abutting both walls 7209 and 7210 on their northern faces. This draws into sharp relief the possibility that walls 7209 and 7210 are in fact associated, with perhaps wall 7212 added to this structure as a later addition. These three walls in particular with associated surfaces will need to be worked out in detail stratigraphically in the future.       A last comment on surface 7208 is its possible association with mud plastered floor 7213 which was uncovered adjacent to 7208 on its eastern side, but at a lower elevation. Therefore the interpretation here is that either surface 7208 at one time extended east to cover floor 7213 and was simply not preserved or the two surfaces/floors coexisted and represent perhaps inside and outside contexts to the same building phase. If this latter hypothesis is the case, then plastered floor 7219 must also be included within this phase as will be discussed below, 7213 and 7219 can be loosely considered equal or at least associated based on color, texture, construction, and elevation.      The second group of floors that were excavated this season and encompass the larger number of surfaces found were either compacted mud or mud plaster floors. The most notable of these came from the northwest corner of the trench associated with walls 7154 and 7163 where two series of superimposed plaster floors (7170/7182/7185/7189/7194 and 7168/7174) were each individually excavated using the HAP. For continuity, an effort was made to draw the HAP sample from the same general area for each floor. Floors 7168 and 7174 located on the western side of wall 7163 were found to be bonded with that wall as was evident at the time of excavation and in the north baulk section.       For the floors between walls 7163 and 7154, 7170 and 7182 showed the clearest evidence for bonding with wall 7163 at the time of excavation, however after the removal of the rest of the floors an almost rainbow of different colored surfaces were visible in the eastern section of 7163 suggesting a definite association between the floors and the wall. As for wall 7154, the associations are less clear due to heavy burning and disturbance on all floors along the western face of this wall. The wall itself along with these surfaces also suffered the disturbance of being cut by later pit 7162 (to be discussed below).      Though a number of distinct floors were able to be distinguished and excavated, work in this area brought to light the reality that many more surfaces were located here and tightly superimposed. These additional surfaces were visible only in the cross-sections of pieces of plaster floor which were noted and photographed at the time of excavation. The fact that each one of these surfaces was only millimeters in thickness made their individual detection and excavation extremely difficult if not impossible.      The last mud plastered floors that will be discussed in detail are 7213 and 7219 each located in the eastern half of the trench. The defining feature for 7213 was the in situ door socket that had been sunk into the plaster of the surface. Unfortunately this socket did not line up with wall 7210, nor was this floor abutting that wall locus so it may be assumed that 7210 was associated with surface 7208 and therefore wall 7209 but not floors 7213 and 7219. 7219 was also found to contain an in situ door socket that had been sunk into the plaster. In this case, the floor on the eastern side of the locus actually rose in elevation to meet the socket and therefore the doorway of the structure. As with 7213 however, a direct link between the door socket and any wall was not uncovered, unless one considers the new mud brick walls that were beginning to emerge on the last day of the season and were therefore left unexcavated.      The most interesting feature of floor 7219 was the sunken plastered pit that showed the greatest evidence for burning. Discovered laying directly on top of the floor due south of this pit was a heavily burnt pedestal base for a pedestalled vessel of some kind. Upon excavation of 7219 using the HAP, it was found that there was an additional pit (7224) that had been sealed by the plastering of floor 7219. This was excavated and found to contain a very gritty coarse ash matrix and mud brick slump but little to no cultural material. Another pit that was uncovered northeast of the plastered 7219 pit and actually below this floor cutting into subsurface fill 7222 was left unexcavated this season and will need to be returned to next year.      Pits   Several pits were excavated throughout the season in F7 with many quite large in size, averaging between 1.5-2 meters is diameter and 0.5-1 meter in depth. In fact, some pit loci (7181, 7193, 7199) were not fully excavated down to the basal levels based on the need to focus excavations in other features of the trench. Despite the presence of cultural debris that resided within the pits as secondary contexts, the pits themselves were lacking in any sort of plaster or stone lining (save for one, see bin 7186) that would aid in interpreting function during their different times of use.       The first major pit to be excavated was located in the southwest corner of the trench emerging from the south baulk (7146). This pit was a continuation of pit 9045 located along the north baulk of trench F9 that was also excavated this season. Apart from a pot cluster that was recovered from the top elevations of the locus and carbon samples that were taken from the extreme basal levels of the pit, no other defining characteristics were unearthed to suggest any kind of function for this pit.      A second major pit that was excavated was located in the northwest corner of the trench cutting directly into the southern edge of wall 7154 and all the associated surfaces (7170, 7182, 7185, 7189, 7194) and fill (7196). This pit was especially deep (reaching just over a meter) with a level bottom elevation apart from a smaller interior pit that was roughly 30-40cm in diameter and 50 cm in depth. Again the exact function of this pit is unavailable, although its stratigraphic relationship to the walls and floors in this area suggest a later date.      The third large pit (7181) to be excavated came from the northeast quadrant of the trench and at this time, has been hypothesized as congruent with structure 7178 and burial 7183/7221. This pit was found to be unique in that the edge was lined with a single course of burnt mud bricks that encompassed the entirety of the lip of the locus. Connected to the top of these bricks were multiple superimposed compacted mud or mud plaster surfaces (three total), to top most as light gray in color and the following two with evidence for burning. It is perhaps the case then that when the pit went out of use, it was filled and plastered over and then later, for whatever reason, was burned along with the rim of bricks. Whether or not this burning episode is connected with that from the 7154/7163 structure is unclear, as pit 7181 is not actually visible in the north baulk section to be associated with the long layer of ash (7164/7161) that caps walls 7163 and 7154, nor does the ashy fill of locus 7153 extend east far enough to encompass pit 7181.      Another enigmatic feature located in the northeast corner of the trench was an ovoid shallow pit or bin 7186 that was partially lined with compacted mud or mud plaster layer on the northern end. The center was composed of loose soil with ash. Mud bricks abutted the locus on the west, south and lower east ends with burnt mud brick debris also coming from the southern area of the locus. The bin's association with pit 7181 can be inferred based on proximity, however the overall function of the bin itself and how or if it was used congruently with 7181 is unclear.      The final large pits to discuss were each cutting into fill loci 7207 and 7211 respectively on either sides of wall 7209 in the center of the trench. Pit 7193 on the eastern side of the wall was \bathtub\ shaped and contained no distinguishing characteristics apart from a compacted sherd cluster that emerged from the northern section of the pit. Pit 7199 was located on the western side of wall 7209 and was found to be abutting on its southern end child burial 7200. This pit was circular in shaped and filled with very fine ash and dark brown silt. Both pits 7193 and 7199 were not fully excavated to their bottom levels.      Finally a specific kind of pit locus that was excavated this season deserves discussion. This includes loci 7192, 7206, and 7218 whose features included mud plaster lining whereby compacted soil fill was able to be \popped\ out/away from the lined bottom which curved in to form a conical shape (7192) and in other cases an internal lining composed of pot sherds of various wares and fabrics that were highly compacted in a sandy pebble matrix (7206, 7218). In all the cases this feature was associated with some kind of structure or wall suggesting that the pits functioned at the time of the building. Their exact function seems unclear though it was suggested by the Director that these could have served as some kind of pot stand for zir/pithoi-type vessels.      Small Finds and Other Objects   The general character of small finds and other objects that were recovered this season point to an overall \domestic\ function for this area of the site. Items such as obsidian and flint blade fragments (which include sickle blade fragments), basalt grinding stone fragments, animal figurines, miniature vessels and cups, a small amount of shell beads, and stone pendants can be considered everyday household items that, put a different way, do not point to any highly organized commercial activities such as metal smelting or large-scale craft production. A few items including andiron fragments and bronze pins do suggest that metallurgy or the trade in metals was present at the site.       An assortment of whole vessels, the most common being footed and pedestalled deep bowls, were also uncovered and excessively important for dating purposes. Based on pottery readings performed in the lab, these vessel types are most probably connected with an early EBA date but could be extended back to encompass a late Late Chalcolithic or even transitional phase date.            Baulk Profiles and Drawings   This season entire baulks were not drawn, instead the northwest corner of the trench including the northernmost end of the west baulk and the western half of the north baulk were drawn. This particular area was chosen for section drawings based on the level of clear stratigraphy that was visible and that details of this section will be key in associating features in this northwest corner of the trench.       As already mentioned, these features include walls 7154 and 7163 with associated floors, all of which are clearly sealed by a relatively thick layer of ash and mud brick debris that seem to be related to a destruction episode. It should be noted that when excavating wall 7163 it was evident that this ash sealed the very top of the wall, however in section this sealing is less clear. The dr"1387,2006-08-06," D-8-2007-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 122,","D-1-2000   August 6, 2000   This is a new Trench! We decided to excavate this new trench, which is located on the east side slope of the tepe (close to facing Tigris), about 15 m down from the top of the tepe. This side has a steep slope, but the area D is somewhat flat and sticks out, like a small bump. The initial thinking was to find a earlier occupation, such as Uruk period. The location of the Trench 1 was chosen randomly and Trench 2 is made at the North side. Because of the steep slope, it was difficult to set-up a stright trench. After we have the total station, we could be more accurate.   Locus 1000This locus represent the top-soil and washed/eroded layer. The east side of the trench is about 1.5 m lower than the West side. North-South does not have much angle. Because of this slope, there will be deep zone of disturbance in top area of this trench. The purpose of this locus is to create a leveled ground. However, I did not wanted to level the entire trench in one shot, so decided to divide the trench into East and West half. I put the line across 2 m from the East and made the workers level the East half first and the West half later. This will create an arbitrary step at the center of the trench (ideally 75 cm high wall). In this way, I could see the profile at the center and decide rather it will be a better idea to excavat the entire trench at one time. If the west half of the trench is in disturbed area, I should level the surface and keep on excavating. However, if I find some kind of undisturbed area, I have to devise a new plan. In any case, dividing the trench, I think, will be a safe-guard against distroying an area of occupational level.    This locus had many pot sherds, mainly from lower elevation (not near surface), and some bones. Found several flakes, so it might be an indication of earlier occupation (but pottery does not suggest that idea? mainly Hellenistic?). There was a concentration of several large rocks at the SW corner of the trench (about 25 cm from both south and west) , but it is most likely a random concentration of rocks. It does not follow any shape; it is placed irregulary. We found no large rocks at the East half of the trench, and we leveled the East half today. We will be working on the West half tomorrow. Anyway, West half seems to contain more large rocks, I do not know why. Also, at the near end of the day, Ihsan found concentration of the large fragments of pot sherds and some large rocks. It does not seems to represent any surface or non-disturbed area, but I will clean the surface and see what is going on around. It is too close to the surface so my suggestion is to just go deeper! In first several levels, I will try and push myself to excavte faster and deeper (but try not to destroy any cultural levels); the answer lies below!      Aug 7, 2000   Locus 1000Still working on the layer of disturbed zone. Now concentrating on the west half of the trench. In this west side, we found more pottery. lithics, and bones. Especially, we found many worked stones. I found a stone bowl (mortar), and stone fish-net weight?(circular grind-stone with hole in the center. Also, several flat, rectangular round edged stones. I do not know why we are getting these materials from this level. pottery seems to be Hellenistic in nature, but lithics and other finds looks like a neolithic site. there were some soil variation in the locus. Andy thinks it is just a baked surface since it is too close to the surface. We have been seeing the same soil everywhere in this site, the hard compacted silt-like soil (almost like a mud-brick). I took out the pot-smash as oone KT number (KT 1011). I decided to close this locus; no definate reason to close, I am seeing some soil variation and it might be a good sign for getting close to the surface.   Locus 1001This locus is the west halsf of the trench. The purpose is to level the entire trench into flat surface. But if we find something, I will close a locus and make a different locus. Basically, the materials that coming out from this locus is same as locus 1000. Many grind0stones and pottery. I found several large rocks, especially concetrarted arond South side of the locus. Later, we found out that there was a stone lined wall sticking out from the West balk. This wall sticks out from the balk for about 30 cm and it ends there. It probably the end of the wall. This wall is made by piling up stones about 3 or 4 rows. It is only a small portion that is exposed at this moment, so I must clean it up tomorrow and see what is the relationship withe the surface that I am seeing now.    Today, we had a TV crew came to visit our site, and we came back from the site later than usual. I tried my best to write a , but I might add some more tomorrow, since I am tired.         Aug 8, 2000   Locus 1001Today was kind of slow day. Anyway, we strated out by scraping and brushing the surface of the 1002 (end of 1001). when we were clearing, I found two posible pits, one at the Southest corner of the locus (south-central part of the trench) and another smaller pit at the North side, abuts to west balk. At this point I assigned a new locus (I had an idea to change the locus from yesterday..)    Locus 1002These pits had darker soil and loosely compacted (crumble). Also, soil was more sandy (fine sand). The hard compacted area is white and silt. Basically, about the same type of soil variation as in Area A trench 1, and possibly other areas. The pit was about 1 m to 1.5 m. Since this locus is still close to the surface, I decided not to make a new loci for these pits. However, I gave different KT numbers for the artifacts. (KT1033 KT1034 KT1035 KT1036). The pit were farly shallow, about 10 cm deep. Bottom of the pit was same as other compacted area. We took a photo after excavating the pits. I think these were just a deep area and disturbed zone. Now, all the soil in this locus looks all the same, except for the wall that sticking out from the west balk. I decided to take the locus down to the finishing level of the locus 1000 at the east side. we start bashing the soil from the south-side. Ihsan found some large rocks near the possible wall. I have not cleaned the area well, so I have to wait for tomorrow, but the rocks seems to be just a collapse. we did not find any large rocks on the East-side (locus 1000). About KT 1039, this was kind of wired find. It looks like a brick. But it could be a piece of pottery? It is kind of square in shape but curves up at the edge. Also, surface seem to be grinded down. It could be a pallet? It actually reminds me of the incense burner from Oman that was discovered in Oman. I don't know what it could be.   I'm not sure why today was unproductive day. Workers were complaining about the not having the tent, and we took about an hour or so to take a picture, and some other unknown factors. Maybe I got used to bashing 1 m a day for last two days, so I'm just feeling this way.      Aug 9, 2000   Locus 1002Since we did not finish Locus 1002, our purpose for today was to bash Locus 1002 and start working on Locus 1003, which will be a flat surface! We took the South East portion of the locus and proceed to Northern portion of the locus. Today, my two workers were somewhat slacking. Perhaps, I should make them work more, or get a new worker. Anyway, I cleared the possible wall. The soil around the wall seemed lettle compacted than around the area, but as we clearing the Locus 1002, it tirned out that the whole SW section of the Locus was somewhat compacted. Also, Deeper part of the Locus were compacted. It seems to be just a variation in the soil (from erosion?). Does not seems to represent any definate cultural levels; no boundary of soil variation, just gradual change. I think (and also Bradley) that this layer is just disturbed sub-topsoil. Although the pile of rocks seems to be in line, only a small section of them are in my trench. If I could dug into the balk, I could know this structure better. The wall was made from piling up the rocks, smaller and round rocks on bottom, and flat and bigger rocks on top. Smaller rocks is about 15 cm in diameter, and larger rocks is about 20 - 30 cm in diameter and app 10 cm thick. Only one pot sherds were discovered while destroying the wall. Since we have a photo, it should be OK to destroy this wall. It seems that Phill got a similar structure in his trench. The wall was about 15 cm in height, and 25 cm wide. The front seems to round up a bit, but several rocks that I found around this structure is probably a fallen rocks from the wall, so the actual shape of this is in mystery. After excavating few levels, we will know more about this wall by looking at the section. Speaking about section, when I was strightening the section, a balk right below a rock seemed somewhat softer and had a brownish color. Near the end of excavating this Locus, I found small pile of rocks sticking out from the North balk (again too close to the balk). This structure was near the ending surface of Locus 1002, so only few rocks are exposed. There seems to be no large rocks are used, but only a pile of round rocks. We will excavate around this structure? tomorrow as Locus 1003 and see the extent of this possible pile of rocks. Other than what I mentioned above, there were no interesting feature from this Locus. I put my workers to stright the balk, since I had a terrible balk. Now the balk looks good. Actually, ihsan is good at making stright wall. We found some sherds while cleaning the balk. I had them put in one place, but it seems like workers took them up to the dolmush. I can not find them... I hope it is not mixed with other pot-sherds. I did not had any tag or bag for those sherds. It was my mistake to leave them out. This Locus was kind of unproductive; I found less materials than Locus 1001. There were no grind-stone and pile of small finds from this locus. I found few shells, and possible? Ninevh 5 base. The shape of the base seems to be N5, and color is light-greenish, and it is thin and well fired. I want the result of pottery reading soon, if I could get them.    Locus 1003After cleaning the surface and cleaning the balk, we started out bashing the surface of Locus 1003, from the North East corner. I told them to bash the entire trench for 25 cm. But they only took 10 cm or so. It was close to the end of the day, so what I can do. Once again, this locus 1003 is the first time that we leveled the entire trench. We will dig this 4 m x 4 m, flat surface tomorrow. I wish something happens tomorrow.       Aug 10, 2000   Locus 1003I'm writing this jounal a day after the actual day of excavation since we went to the week-end trip. This is the first time I wrote the  day after... So, my description may contain some misleading remarks. I decided to remove as much dirt as possible today. As I mentioned above, this is the first time that the trench was leveled. We started excavating from the East side and dug all the way to the West side. The east side is still in sub-topsoil, but the west side could be in occupational level. after clearing the surface, there were gradual line, but definate difference between the soil from west to east. Conveniently, the soil seems to be divided just about 2 m line. It was probably not a good idea to combine the west side of the trench and the east side of the trench. After the bashing has fiished, I brushed the surface and see if there is any sign of occupation. On the NW cornaer and SW corner, the soil seemed very compacted; almost like a mud-brick, especially on the North side. The texture is silt, white-grey in color. In the central part of the West side, soil was somewhat loosely cimpacted, and had some pebbles within the soil. It also appeared brownish. The soil on the North and West did not had any pebbles. There was a definate difference in the soil (something is going on!). Some soil of the NW looked like a mud-brick. However, the bashing crew did a horrible job of making a flat surface, and I really could not tell what was going on. The surface had many bumps and low spots. I told them to make the West side more flat. Also, the West side was much higher than the Eat side. We finished our job for the day while flattening the West side. So, tomorrow, we will make the surface nice and flat, and see the surface. there might be a mud-brick surface! About the east side, I will divide the trench into half (I don't like digging with two completely different levels) and excavate it deeper. This is only my thought, but in the past, the area where my trench was the edge of the mound. All the east side is just piled up erosion layer. Dividing the trench seems like I am excavating two trenches in one trench; it will be more work!      Aug 12, 2000   Continue flattening the surface of 1003 on the west side. This time, workers did better job. We brushed and see the surface. There was a definate line between loose soil and compacted soil. East side is loose, gray, sub-topsoil. I draw a line following the division of this transition. I made the east side (loose, sub-topsoil) as locus 1004, and west side (compacted) as 1005. While the workers took down the 1004, I excavated (destroyed) the pile of rocks that was floating at the North balk, about 1 m from the west. This structure waas made from several flat rocks of about 2 -5 cm in thickness, and rounded, about 4 - 6 cm in diameter. There were several layer of this rocks, but not in particular order, but it was all layed flat. But few rocks were round, or layed sideways. This rock pile finished around 1002 and 1003 transition in profile, or little deeper. The soil had no significant difference, it was not a mud-bricjk or mortor. I found two pieces of teeth, probably horse in the rock pile. The soil around the teeth seemed brownish in color. I gave different KT numberes (1055 &amp; 1056) for pottery and bones. I gave them Locus 1002, since this structure was in that Locus. I thought about assigning a new Locus, but the rock-pile did not seemed that significant. I am not sure it was cultural or not. Also, I took down another pile of rocks at the SW corner (1 m from W &amp; S). This pile was not layed on levels. Just a conglomorate of 7 large rocks. Soil around the pile seemed compacted and color looked brownish. This pile did not had a flat rocks, and shape and the size of the rocks were irregular. This, I doubt to be cultural.    Locus 1004we took several cm down, but found almost nothing. We will take down more tomorrow and hope to find some cultural layer.       Aug 13, 2000   Locus 1004I sent in some bashing crew, which was not perfect, but did a good job, today to excavate this Locus on the East side of the hill. Told them to bash 50 cm, or until find something different. There were not really any interesting feature, but at one point, soil gradually became harder. (about mid-way, I don't know the exact elevation). The soil had variation, some area were hard (but not as hard as the soil in Locus 1005), and had some deep loose soil. I could polk a trowel into some areas easily, but it dis not follow any definate shape, so it was not a pit; cause by washing down of the soil. AFter a while, we reached the white, compacted, silt-like layer, which is almost exactly looks same as the soil of Locus 1005. It was strange that the difference in soil followed the line that I made. I thought the white soil will have a gradual slope, but the loose soil seemed to went down in straight line, except for one area in the center where there is a divot. This was probaby some variation in the soil. The white layer seemed to gradually filled this space as we excavte deeper. I think that thiis could be a trace of ancient land-shape, or caused by mud-slide. The white-compacted soil did had a little slope, but it was not a gradual slope at all. We closed the Locus when we reached the white compacted layer.    Locus 1005I first thought about excavating the whole West half as I did in Locus 1004, but Andy took a look at D2 and found a possible mud-brick wall at the SW corner of the trench. Since my trench is just south of the D2, this is just 1 m away from the possible mud-brick that I found in NW corner of my trench. So, I decided to scrape off the surface (again) and see what is going on. Last time, the workers did a horrible job on strightening the surface, so I told then to do a better job and I scraped the surface by myself. We took off about 5 to 10 cm or so. There still does not seems to have a mud-brick, although it kind of looks like it in some area. There are grooves in the hard-mud that is filled with loose soil, in stright line, but one here and there. Also, I found a strange discoloration of the soil. When I brush, it looked like a pile of ash, but when I scrape, I found a bluish-gray color. This color is about 10 cm thick and follow a circle. It starts from the edge of NW corner, than curves to south, and curves back to the west balk. It could be a top of an oven, but it is hard to tell at this pint. The soil inside this circle seems to be harder than the soil outside. We ran out of time when I strat seeing this shape, I will see this closely tomorrow.       Aug 15, 2000   Locus 1005Well, yesterday I had a fever and did not go out to the site. So, today, I'm not feeling that great but I did my best. Day before yesterday, I found a dark-bluish discoloration in the NW corner of the trench. Today, I tried to define what this is. I excavated arond and inside, but it seems to be just a variation in the soil. The soil seems to be burnt, since it had some small frag of charcoal within. It did not follow any definate shape. I found same soil arond it when I dug deeper. I thought it could be an oven, but the soil was not ashy. I found a flat-compacted mud below these discoloration. But, this too had not distinctive shape, and had many animal holes around them. Found no pottery, lithics, or bones around. Before I began excavting this area, I thought about giving a different Locus number, but I decided not to.    Now, we began bashing the rest of Locus 1005. We first excavated about 20 cm and see what was there, but it was taking longer than I thought, so I decided to knock the whole thing down at once. I lost 1 day, and the days that is left is short, so I must hurry up and level this trench.       Aug 16, 2000   Today, I slept in for a while in Bismil and came after the breakfast. Workers were bashing before I arrived. I was feeling better, but not in a perfect state; I had approximately 76.38021 % of my average strength today. I was drawing a section of the D3 and did not concentrate on what was going on at the trench 1. I hope they were doing a good job. There are still some soil left to dig tommorow. We will finish this trench. Level the whole trench, stright the balk and I'm out of here!         TRENCH SUMMARY OF AREA D TRENCH 1 (before pottery reading)      The purpose of this trench was to reach the early occupational level of the site since the area D was located at the lower part of the site. During a survey, we found some pot-sherds from early period (Chalcolithic, Uruk, etc). Area D is located at the east side of the Tepe below a steep hill where there is relatively flat area like a hump that sticks out from the Tepe. We did not achieved our purpose in this season. Because of the deep disturbed top and sub-top soil, it took us a week to excavte to reach the possible cultural level, and we began excavte this area during a last week. We have not looked at the pottery in detail, so I am not certain about the age of the Loci that I excavated. Although I am not a pottery expert by any sense, most of the pottery appears to be from the Hellenistic period. Lower levels seems to be earlier. We must wait for the pottery reading. However, this area still looks promising for next season. Trench 3, which is located 1 m West (1 m uphill) of Trench 1 had multiple layer of surfaces and possible Hellenistic wall, or a path. When I walked around this area, especially below the area D, I found several fragments of early pottery, even possible Ubaid rim-sherd, many lithics, such as obsidian. Also, from this trench, and Trench 2, which is just North of this trench, seems to produce more lithics and grind-stone than other areas. Since we finish excavting the disturbed zone, if we given several days to excavte, there is a great possibility that we could achieve our original purpose of this Area.    LOCUS 1000 (E 85.34-85.22 W 86.76-86.05)   This Locus is the top-soil and heavily disturbed. Because of the steep slope, I expected to have a deep top and sub-topsoil. Interesting enough, I found many worked stone artifacts, such as stone-bowl, possible weight (circular shape with a hole in the center), and others; for more info look at the KT 1003,1005, 1007, 1008, 1010, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1017, 1018, 1019, 1022, 1024). First I thought this could be the indication of the early occupation of this area. Near the North balk, about 1 m from the west balk, I found a concentration of the pottery. It appears to be a pot-smash, but it is too close to the present surface (KT 1011). I found a hard compacted layer of the soil below this potsmash, and gave a new Locus 1001. Because of the slope, I decide to assigne locus 1001 for only west side of the trench. We did not excavte much in the east side; as I mentioned above, West side had a compacted soil, but East half was still in top-soil. I divided the trench in half, and made a arbitrary steps at the 2 m line.   Locus 1001 (West 1/2 86.05-85.86)    The purpose of this Locus was to level the entire trench flat, unless we reach a possible cultural layer. There was a possible stone piled wall (86.13) at the SW corner of the trench, and found 2 possible pit, so I closed the Locus and gave Locus 1002. We found several large rocks around this possible wall; probably fallen from the wall. The soil arond the wall seemed somewhat compacted, but did not seems to be much of anything. The wall was made of piling up the flat and round rocks for about 30 cm in height. In this locus, above and below, I found sevral brick fragments, those could be Hellenistic in age.    Locus 1002 (West 1/2 85.86-85.63)   Since we found 2 possible pit, and soil was more compacted than locus 1001. First I thought that this could be a cultural surface. The stone lined wall finished in this Locus. Also, we found a pile of rocks in the North balk. A possible pit were located on the South-centarl section of the trench, irregular shape of about 1.75 m in length and 1 m + wide. the another pit was smaller, and it was located on the west balk, on the north side, about 1.25 m in length. I excavted both pits, and found relatively few pot-sherds, bricks, lithics, and bones. (chech KT 1033, 1034, 1035, and 1036). These pits seemed to be just a variation in the soil. The shape of the pit was irregular, and did not have uniform depth. I decided to make the whole trench flat. The pile of rocks that I found near the North balk was constructed by flat-rocks, and found a possible equid teeth. (KT 1055 and KT 1056). In general soil seemed to be somewhat vary in nature and disturbed, it could be still in the sub-top soil, especilly in the Eastern side of this Locus.   Locus 1003 (85.63 - 85.20)   This is the first time that I had a flat trench! Strange enough, there is less worked stone in lower levels. I found a pile of rocks about 1 m away from the SW corner of the trench. However, this did not look like constructed by human. Soil was same as inside and around the rocks. Some rocks were layed flat but many rocks were on side. I excavated for about 30 cm, and found a line between loose and compacted. This line roughly followed the 1.5 m line from East balk. Loose soil to the East is probably still in the top-soil but the west side could be in cultural level. I decided to excavted the loose soil (Locus 1004) first and than compacted soil (Locus 1005).    Locus 1004 (85.20 - 84.75)   This Locus is the East side of the line which is loose soil. I thought that the Compacted soil will gradually slopes down, but it more or less went down straight. One area at the center had a slope of compacted soil. About 30 - 40 cm below, we found a compacted soil, which is similar to the soil west -side. I think at this point, it is below the top-soil. There were some pottery and lithics. Found obsidian fagments and several pieces of bricks from this Locus.    Locus 1005 (85.20 - 84.84)   This Locus is the west side of the trench with the hard compacted soil. This Locus started out with a promise of discovery, but turned out to be little disappointment. In Northwest corner of the trench, I found a hard-compacted soil that looked as a mud-brick. We tried to make the soil flat and see if there is a mud-brick or not. There were few several lines, but were not stright and the soil looked disturbed. In the same area, I found a band of dark soil that seemed to be in circular shape. First I thought it could be an oven; the size and shape of the dark soil was similar to that of A1 Locus 1018. This dark soil contained chrcoal. I excavated and tried to define the shape. When I start excavating, it turned out that the shae was irregular and had more dark-soil below. I decided to bash this area and make the trench flat. So that next year, when someone comes back, they will have a flat trench. Found grind-stone and Obsidian from this Locus.      For this season, the Area D trench 1 resulted in some disappointment, but for next year, there is a great chance of discovery of this Trench. From this season, we basically removed the thick top-soil that was washed down from the steep slope. For next year, we should reach the earlier ocuupational levels. We found many grind-stones, lithics, and Obsidian. All pottery seems to be from Hellenistic age, but still wait to be seen.                        ,~dc-terms:title: D-1-2000 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 1,"1388,2006-08-06," D-6-2007-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 83,","D-2-2000   August 6, 2000      Today I am started a new trench in Area D, on the east slope of Kenan Tepe. Randy is in the next trench over, Trench 1, and is also responsible for Trench 3, a 2x2 sounding adjoining Trench 1 to the west. I am in Trench 2, which is directly to the North of Trench 1.       At the start of the day, Randy and I took elevations for all three trenches, and then spent some time rounding up workmen and tools. After that task was more or less completed, I had my workmen dig approximately 15 cm throughout the trench in order to clear out the layer of topsoil.       While cleaning up L 2000, 2 chunks of basalt were discovered. KT 2003, in the SW quadrant of the trench, was a flat stone with a central hole. Though not complete, it appears to be some kind of weight. KT 2004 was found in the NW corner of the trench, and is a fragment of a grindstone.      After all the dirt from L 2000 was removed, I decided to start the process of levelling the trench by opening a new locus below L 2000 and digging in the eastern half. L 2001 will be dug so that everything will be even with the lowest point, which is located in the NE corner.       We continued digging this locus until the end of the day. Large amounts of pottery, several small finds, and one scorpion were found in L 2001, which consists of very loose, crumbly soil with coarse granules. Among the more interesting of the small finds was a large stone in the S balk, which appeared to be a complete, non basalt grindstone. It was large and heavy.      Another interesting object was found at the end of the day near the middle of the trench. It appeared to be a kind of concrete mixed with large pebbles. Andy says that it is a naturally forming concrete-like substance known as river conglomerate.       We will continue digging L 2001 tomorrow.      August 7, 2000      Today we are continuing to dig in the eastern half of L 2001. The soil remains the same coarse granule texture, and it seems likely that we are still digging through a topsoil/wash layer from further up the hill. We are going to try to level the trench N/S first, and then work from there.      After quite a bit of digging, we finally started finding some harder soil in the deepest part of the trench, that is near the center of the trench along the S balk. Andy came by and we decided to start digging in the western half of 2001, starting with a section on the north side of the trench.      Very shortly after we had started digging this section, the workmen uncovered a very nice cylinder seal, depicting on the side that wasn't covered with dirt a man fighting a lion. Also in this area was found a large donut shaped basalt weight.      The rest of the day was spent cleaning the sections, and removing all the dirt that was dug today. There remains some work to do tomorrow to level the area dug in the western half of the trench with that in the eastern half.      August 8, 2000      This morning we are digging out the remaining dirt from the area in the western half of the trench that was dug yesterday--it is not yet quite level with the eastern half of the trench. While we were doing this, I noticed a distinct line in the section below which the soil was much darker. While it may have been due only to a higher moisture content, I am having the workmen dig only to this level from now on.      After the above mentioned area was cleared out, we began digging the south central part of L 2001 to the level of the soil change. Nothing eventful was found in this area, and after cleaning it up we moved to the northwest quadrant of the trench.      While digging the eastern half of this area, a partial basalt grindstone was found in the section between what we were digging and the are that was dug yesterday. Later, we encountered several large rocks that appeared to be associated with each other. After articulating the rocks somewhat and searching the area for more (without success, though we did find a network of scopion/gopher holes) I decided to dig the western part of the northwest quadrant only to the level of the top of the newly found rocks. However, roughly 10-15 cm down in this area, the workmen encountered what appeared to be a cobble surface, similar to the path Randy had found in the sounding D3.       We then decided to dig the southwestern quadrant of the trench to the level of the cobbles to see if they continued into this area. We dug 20 cm and did not discover a surface, just a few scattered cobbles. While it is possible that there may be more cobbles 10 cm or so lower, it seems most likely that the stones in the NW quadrant are just collapse from further up the hill. Nevertheless, we will continue to search a little bit more in the SW quadrant tomorrow. If nothing comes up, we will blast the western half of the trench down to the level of the larger stones found today.      August 9, 2000      The first thing I did today was remove a piece of basalt grindstone that had begun to surface yesterday in the SW quadrant of the trench. While I was documenting this find, the workers were struggling to set up our new giganto-tent. This morning I figure we will dig another 5 - 10 cm in the SW quadrant as L 2001. Then we will open a new locus and dig the entire western third of the trench to the level of the soil change.      However, while digging the SW, a couple of rows of large stones were discovered very early on. It may be a continuation of the path in Randy's sounding, however there does not appear to be a cobble surface (or any surface for that matter) associated with the rows of stones. In order to get a better idea of what is going on, we are taking down the pile of debris in the NW quadrant of the trench, and also digging down 20cm in the area immediatley to the east of the line of stones. After Drew photographs, we will take this area down to the level of the soil change as it appears to include only the same crumbly fill as the rest of L 2001.      While cleaning the trench for a photo, another chunk of basalt was found along the western balk. After Drew took a few shots of the stone lines, we took the area to the east of the stones down, and did not find anything interesting.      After the dirt from that section of L 2001 was cleaned up, we began excavating an area in the NW quadrant as L 2002. L 2002 turned out to be a fill with soil similar to L 2001. However, this locus contained many, many more stones and potsherds per square inch than L 2001. Many of the sherds appeared to be Hellenistic. The area of large stones documented on yesterday's day plan was found to extend to the western balk. L 2002 was closed today after the level of the soil change observed in L 2001 was reached. The soil was also noticeably harder at this point. The pile of stones in the middle of L 2002 will be excavated as a separate locus tomorrow.       I have to do a lot of measuring and drawing in the next hour, and Drew also has to come and photograph the trench and rock pile. After the photo, the workers will be kept busy digging another 10 - 20 cm in the eastern part of the trench, still as L 2001 because we haven't gotten very deep below the surface at all in this area.      Tomorrow I will open a whole bunch of new loci in the western part of the trench, and hopefully the workers will be able to blast the area down quite a bit.      August 10, 2000      This morning we started by cleaning up the rest of the dirt that was left over from digging in the eastern half of the trench ysterday afternoon. Nothing was found except for a few potsherds.      We also dug out the last remaining bit of L 2002, an small area along the west balk where a rock and a large potsherd had been pedestaled.      Today I am opening lots of loci. The line of rocks in the SW quadrant are now L 2003, and the area to the west of these rocks is L 2004. We are starting by digging L 2004 approximately 10 - 20 cm, to see if we can find a surface associated with the line of rocks. No surface was found, so L 2004 was closed, and the line of stones was removed as L 2003. This action completed, the entire raised area in the SW quadrant was dug as L 2005. While L 2005 was being dug, however, two potentially intersting areas were discovered. A pile of large stones was found in the northern section of the locus, and an area of very hard soil, with a few large stones, was found in the Southern part. Between these two areas, L 2005 was dug to the level of the soil change found on 8/8/2000.      The area was cleaned up and Drew took a photo. After Bradley had decided that the hard soil in the SW corner was just random debris, we dug that area as L 2007 down to the level of the soil change from 8/8. The pile of large stones was dug as L 2006. Nothing exciting was found in either of these loci except for a small chunk of basalt that popped up in L 2006.      After L 2006 was cleaned up, we moved on to dig the pile of stones in the NW corner, discovered yesterday, as L 2008. Another chunk of basalt was found here.       We then worked on cleaning the balks for a while, and after that was finished, the workers dug a little further in the eastern part of the trench.      August 12, 2000      Today we are opening L 2009 in the west half of the trench and digging down level with the eastern half of the trench. So far nothing interesting has surfaced, although the area below L 2007 in the SW corner is continuing to be very hard, so we will dig that separately as L 2010. There was also a small (30 cm diameter) grouping of four stoness in the NW corner, but since they were small, floating, apparently random, and not near anything else, we removed them.      When L 2009 is done being leveled, we may decide to divide the trench into quadrants and blast the SW one down until we hit something. However, in the process of leveling L 2009, we came across an extensive pit, or else just a very soft layer of dirt, covering most of the westen half of the trench, and some areas in the eastern half. In order to deal with this, we will close L 2009 and open L 2011 as a level of very soft fill.      We spent the rest of the day digging L 2010, although it was not completely leveled by the time the workday was over. We will dig it flat tomorrow, and also open L 2011.      August 13, 2000      Today we started by opening L 2011 in the western half of the trench and digging it down roughly 30 cm. An area of stones was found along the N balk. It doesn't look like much, but for now we are leaving it alone.       Possible oven residue was found in three small circles near the center of L 2011. Soil samples were taken from each, but they were not given separate locus numbers.      Andy came by and noticed that L 2010 was still looking pretty rough from yesterday, so he had us clean it up. When he came back it was looking like there were some mudbrick lines in the W balk. so we brought L 2010 down a little further to level it and straightened the balks as best we could. After cleaning and spraying L 2010 and the SW corner of the trench, it seems that there is a mud brick wall in this area. We have probably cut through about 1.5 courses. Lines are visible in the balks, and also in the southern half of L 2010.       Tomorrow we will scrape L 2010 down further in order to make the lines clearer. However, starting tomorrow L 2010 will be known as L 2012.      August 14, 2000      Andy and Bradley came by early this morning after we scraped L 2010 flat. We decided that the area was not well defined enough to be mud brick yet, so we are holding off on opening L 2012. Instead, we are going to take L 2010 down another 5 cm to see if we are able to start seeing mudbrick lines.      After removing 5 cm and scraping the area super flat, it looks less likely that there is a wall in this area. Bradley came by and noticed that the lines in the balk are starting to look more like sedimentary layers than brick: there are long continuous horizontal lines, but no vertical ones except for animal holes. In addition, the lines that were once faintly visible on the surface of L 2010 have now pretty much disappeared.       Now the plan is to flatten L 2011 and then to bring L 2010 down level with it. We will then decide what to do with the locus situation on the western half of the trench. In flattening L 2011, we continued to have the same areas of very soft soil that we had yesterday. Towards the middle of the locus there were again small areas of different colored soil. After we finished level the main part of L 2011, we started work on the pile of rocks along the N balk. There were quite a few stones in this area, but they appeared to be just tumble, so we kept them as L 2011. We did however, give the area its own KT numbers.      When L 2011 was completely leveled, we started working on bringing L 2010 down. However, my workmen were starting to drag at this point, and in the time left we were only able to get half of L 2010 chopped. At some point while we were digging this section, Andy came by and said that he thought there still might be a wall in this area, but it might be lower down.      Tomorrow is my last day, so we will try and get a little deeper, but it is not looking likely that we will find anything. There are some stones starting to come up in the southern half of L 2011 however.      August 15, 2000      We are starting off today by finishing the excavation of L 2010, so that it is level with the rest of the western half of the trench. When that is complete, we will cleanup the trench and try and make sense of of the situation in the western half.       After digging and cleaning, we encountered no evidence that L 2010 was part of a wall. However, on the brighter side, it became apparent that the rocks uncovered yesterday in the southern half of L 2011 are actually part of a cobble surface. We troweled and explored the area a little further, and found definite edges to the surface. It does not cover a particularly large area, but it appears to be extending into the eastern half of the trench. In order to follow the surface, we are opening a section of the eastern half of the trench as L 2012. This locus appears equal to L 2001.      After L 2012 was dug and cleaned, we noticed that the surface appeared to continue further into the eastern half of the trench, but became consistently narrower as it continued. In order to try and figure out what was going on, we decided to extend L 2012 to cover the entire eastern half of the trench, and dig it down level with the surface. It should also be mentioned that an area of discolored soil was found in L 2012 near the center of the trench--possibly more oven residue.      Unfortunately, we were not able to complete the excavation of L 2012 before the workday was over, so the extent and overall shape of the surface is still unclear. At this stage, it appears that it may be triangular in shape. It also includes quite a few potsherds.        ,~dc-terms:title: D-2-2000 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 2,"1389,2007-06-01," E-2-2007-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 152,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   June 1, 2007      Recorder: Mila Hover (a.k.a. Melek hanim, MH)Workers: Cengis, Necat, Sadik (Biraz hizli, lutfen!)      Today is the first day of work at the site (Kenan Tepe) for the 2007 season. I am assigned to area D8 where the main objective for the day is to perform cleaning of the accumulated debris due to erosion during the off season. Initial examination revealed moderate to high level of erosion which had covered the trench protected by a plastic sheet. The highest amounts had accumulated along the west baulk. Photographs were taken before the work began. According to plan, work started in the furthest NW corner of the trench and proceeded due SW along the baulk. During the debris removal, at the bottom of west baulk, a layer of ash was revealed in the profile approximately 0.40 m off the intersection of the trench floor and the baulk. A second layer of ash appeared below this one and followed the floor level of the trench about 3.85 m south of the north trench wall (baulk). From this ash layer, a single animal bone (long, with articulated end) bone eroded onto the trench floor. It did not appear to be burned or charred.   The top ash layer covers approx. 0.65 m of the wall in the NW corner of the trench and appears to sit above it. It extends over almost half of the baulk southward.   During the next phase of debris removal, the cell room floors and walls were cleaned as the protective plastic sheet and overlaying debris were taken away. In L123 (previously named L114), the floor bricks became apparent and at this point, we were confident that we have reached the previously recorded surfaces of structures. Elevation was taken in the same room cell.    On the surface of an adjacent room cell, a pseudomorphic layer and a single pottery shard compacted into the floor surface was recovered.    Work will continue tomorrow as new loci are assigned and new surfaces revealed.      ,~: D-8-2007-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 122,"1390,2007-06-01," D-6-2007-06-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 85,","   June 1, 2007   Area D   Trench 6   Excavators: Jason Kennedy, Barish Uzel      Today was the first day of excavations at Kenan Tepe for the 2007 field season. We began by opening a cleaning locus, locus 83, in order to remove the erosional fill. After removing the erosion and delineating the rock structure that would become Locus 84 (last season_Ñés Locus 73), we took pictures and closed the cleaning Locus (Locus 83). We opened Locus 84 and removed the upper layer of rocks and uncovered a rock wall running roughly north-south. This wall was named locus 87, and it is our belief that locus 87 is a supporting or foundation wall for the structure removed in locus 84. We also opened new loci following the plan from last year. Locus 85 constitutes last year_Ñés Locus 82 and is a cobble, pebble, and pot sherd surface running roughly north-south the length of the trench. Locus 86 contains last year_Ñés locus 79 and locus 81, and is potentially a mudbrick structure or terrace abutting the street at its current level in the northwest corner of the unit. Locus 89 encompasses last season_Ñés Locus 69 and is probably a fill locus. Locus 90 is an erosional fill zone that covers last year_Ñés loci 75, 78, and 80. After renaming these loci we opened up locus 88, which is the fill zone below Locus 84 that is separated from the pebble surface of locus 85 by wall 87.      ,~: D-6-2007-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 83,"1391,2007-06-01," F-7-2007-06-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7226,","   Trench E2   June 01, 2007   E. Clark      Workmen: Tanir, Arif, Sidik      Today we began with a cleaning locus, L152, taking away the erosion that has accumulated for the last couple of years. A lot of dirt has accumulated, and thus we did not finish this locus today, the sole locus of the day. By the end of the day we cleared the plastic protective covering on roughly half the trench, revealing the walls that were there when excavation ended two years ago. Tomorrow I intend to finish this cleaning locus, prepare the trench for photographs, take the photos, and begin excavation.           ,~: E-2-2007-06-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 152,"1392,2007-06-02," D-6-2007-06-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 91,","   June 2, 2007   Area D   Trench 6   Excavators: Jason Kennedy and Barish Uzel      We began today in Locus 85. We made one pass with big picks uncovering a continuation of the pebble surface. Barish then decided to make another pass with the big pick which revealed a soil change in the north and west portion of the trench and a continuation of the pebble surface in the middle, suggesting an older level and in somewhat different position of the pebble surface road in the trench. Two loom weights, (KT # 2 and 3), a basalt grinding stone (Kt # 4), and a bronze arrowhead (KT #5) were recovered from the removal of Locus 85. We then decided to bring Locus 86, our believed mudbrick terrace down to the current level of Locus 85. After cleaning Loci 86 and 85 we photographed them and decided to bring Locus 90, the erosional fill in the southeast corner of the trench down to the level of Locus 85 in hopes of outlining a further extension of the wall in Locus 87. We then took Locus 88 down to the level of locus 90, 86, and 85 to further delineate wall 87 and to examine the subfloor fill of Locus 88 below the foundation structure that was Locus 84. It is also possible that an earlier pebble surface road runs under locus 88. We then continued to remove Locus 89 to the level of locus 85 and 88 to attempt to discover more of wall 87. We then removed the wall, Locus 87, and took that level down to the same level of the rest of the trench. Within the wall in 87 we discovered a Basalt Loom Weight (KT #1) and three Basalt Grinding Stones (KT #_Ñés 2, 3, and 4). Two of the large grinding stones (KT #2 and KT #3) were built into the wall suggesting their reuse in building after their initial use as grinding slabs. After taking the entire trench down to the level of Locus 85 we then cleaned the trench, prepared for photographs, and took final elevations shots to allow us to close Loci 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, and 90.     ,~: D-6-2007-06-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 85,"1393,2007-06-02," F-7-2007-06-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7228,","   Kenan Tepe   Area F   Trench 7   June 2, 2007   C. Painter      This is the first day of excavation in F7 for the 2007 season. This is the only trench in Area F where work is being undertaken this year. The purpose of excavating in F7 is to hopefully come down onto the western edge of a large building uncovered in F2 during the 2005 season. Thus F7 has been divided in half (west-east) so that only the eastern half, measuring 5 x 10 meters, will be excavated.    Today most of the time was spent clearing out the back fill and erosional debris that had accumulated in the trench over the past two years. The deepest deposits are in the corners while in the middle of the trench, the plastic is almost completely exposed in some places. Two loci were initially assigned as cleaning loci: L7226 and 7228. The larger locus, 7228, was approximately 3-5cm higher than 7226, so 7228 was partially excavated down to the level of 7226.    While 7228 was being excavated from the north, I uncovered a mud brick wall through surface scraping in the southeast quadrant of 7228. At this point, I decided to end the southward excavation of 7228 at an arbitrary point and assign a new locus in the southeast. This locus, 7230, was dug with trowels at a 2cm deep scrape in order to better view the new wall 7229 and see how far the wall continues to the southeast or if there is other architecture. It is notable that wall 7229 is almost the same orientation as the 50cm wide wall from F2, however 7229 is at least 30cm, if not more, higher in elevation.   Wall 7229 was discovered as I excavated a stone feature 7227 (2005 field season locus 7217). In scraping 7230, the old fire pit locus 7219 from the 2005 season was uncovered. This is a reminder just how mixed the fill loci I have excavated today are. Due west of the pit is an ashy area that will have to be dug tomorrow. Another ashy area lies southeast of wall 7229.     ,~: F-7-2007-06-02 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7226,"1394,2007-06-03," D-8-2007-06-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 132,","   June 3, 2007   Area D   Trench 6   Jason Kennedy and Barish Uzel         We began today by measuring out our new loci and photographing and taking elevations of the trench. We then opened Locus 91, which is the continuation of the street pebble surface (Locus 85), with the appearance of a street running east to west towards the Tigris. We took a Hap sample from the center of the N-S section of the street, and found one fishnet weight (KT #2) from the NE corner of Locus 91. We then cleared the locus for photographs and discovered what could be some architecture along the central Eastern edge of Locus 91 below what was the Wall (Locus 87). To attempt to delineate that potential structure we took Locus 94 down with a small pick to articulate the rock walls. While the workmen took out Locus 94, Barish and I removed the erosional fill in Locus 95. Next we photographed the potential architecture in Locus 94 and removed the rest of that Locks to the level of the street (Locus 91). Barish and I then leveled Locus 92 to the level of the street (Locus 91), and in the NW corner we found an Ubaid sherd near the bottom of the locus. While the workmen were cleaning Locus 92, Barish and I then removed Locus 93, the erosional fill, in the NE corner of the trench. We then cleaned the entire trench, photographed the loci, and took final elevations.      ,~: D-6-2007-06-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 91,"1395,2007-06-03," D-6-2007-06-04 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 96,","   Kenan Tepe   Area F   Trench 7   C. Painter   June 3, 2007      We began today by first sweeping the entire trench. No additional features, save for two ash pits/lenses and wall 7229, are visible. Each ash lens was given a locus number (7231 and 7132 respectively) and was excavated. Then the rest of fill L7230 was dug 2-3cm with hand picks to the level of 7226, pedastalling the wall stub 7229 in the process. At this point, the entire trench is level and fill 7230 was closed.   By excavating 7230 around L7229, I was able to see that the wall stub was only a single thin course, therefore I removed the wall stub and closed that locus. At this point, a new locus was opened in the southern end of the trench below 7230 (new locus 7234) which was excavated roughly 5-7cm with large picks. The soil matrix here seems to be very compact, as I originally asked for 15cm to be dug. Roughly 7-9cm were also excavated in the northeast corner of L7226.   Another locus was opened (7233) where another ash lens was apparent after the removal of 7230. However, in the end, I believe it is simply residual ash from the locus just above (7232), so these two loci are equal. No artifacts were found and there was not enough soil for a soil sample.        ,~: F-7-2007-06-03 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area F/Trench 7/Locus 7228,"1396,2007-06-04," D-8-2007-06-05 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8/Locus 132,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   June 4, 2007      Recorder: Mila Hover (a.k.a.

Bring the level of L134 to the current level of the area over the previous L125 (cell room in the Ubaid stricture) in order to locate any earlier phases in the architecture.          After removing a 5cm layer, no new mud brick walls are observed. This may be a clue to the later expansion in the floor plan of the structure. The only preexisting walls at this elevation are the walls directly under the ones dividing the Ubaid cell rooms L124 and L125 and the south wall of L125. They form a cell with dimensions 2.43m (NS) x 2.07 (EW). It will be given a new locus number. During the process of removing the top 5cm, a parallel mud brick wall became visible 0.70m west of the NS oriented plastered wall. Its width is 0.26m, and at this stage, its measurable length is 1.20m.   Note: plaster on both, interior and exterior surface of the wall is observed for the first time at this elevation.      In the NE part of L134, about 1.5m south of the EW oriented plastered wall, a possible work area is observed. This is based on the concentration of various tools and implements, pot sherds, lithics, and bones. Among them is a complete, oval shaped, basalt ground stone with dimensions 0.25m x 0.20m.       We were not able to start the excavation of the \work\ area as indicated in the daily goal #1.

Locus 99 is an erosional fill zone that we took down to the level of the street in Locus 96. We then took out Locus 100, running along the eastern edge of the trench. Locus 100 is separated from the street (Locus 96) by a wall (Locus 98). It is our belief that Locus 100 could represent a subfloor fill or rooms for an associate building behind the wall (Locus 98). While the workers worked on Locus 100, Barish and I began removing Locus 97, an area of compact silt beginning in the NW corner of the trench. Here we discovered a stain that could represent a 2nd millennium oven near the bottom of the Locus. The possible oven has been given Locus 101. We then began to delineate the architecture in Locus 98, and in the process discovered two clay disks (KT # 1 and 2).

After finishing the removal of the top 5cm layer in L134, the small mud brick perpendicular to the North baulk is still visible. Our goal is initially to scrape the surrounding surface in order to establish this wall_Ñés dimensions.      Later, the surface of L132 (courtyard) will be brought down by 5cm in the same manner as in L134 to investigate the fill in this area.      During the first 5cm reduction, near the SW corner of the trench, half of an Ubaid painted vessel was found, approximately 7cm east of the baulk. It is surrounded by well packed soil mixed with ash and charcoal pieces. Near the vessel, a scatter of heavily ed bones and large pieces of mud brick were found. Shortly after that, an animal long bone was observed just below the half vessel. South of this concentration, an animal tooth was located. Additional smaller pot sherds and lithics were found in the fill surrounding the vessel. Carbon was collected for sampling and the dirt underlying the half pot was collected also.       In the second 5cm removal of the top of the L132, near the border with L134, a white lens of compacted grain was found. Sample of the substance was collected. Some charcoal was mixed with it, and carbon sample was collected as well.   Near the West baulk, several areas of ash and heavily burnt small pebbles and pottery appear. Overall, most of L132 contains some amounts of ash mixed within the fill.    Large amounts of grey chert, some obsidian flakes, fragments of pottery (ranging from small to large), bone, shell, and numerous fragmented or whole stone tool implements are present.

After the completion of said plan, we intended on removing L156 to find the next surface. Unfortunately, the entire day was spent plotting the bricks and pits accurately for the plans, which were completed at the close of the day. Thus, the removal of L156 will be worked on tomorrow.       Locus 153 was officially started today, extending 2 meters from the southern baulk, and down about 20cm so far. The fill that was removed was very highly contaminated by erosion and soil dumps, meaning that we have not taken any finds from this locus so far. All finds would be out of context.

Excavation of the fill in Ubaid structure cells took place after the overlaying debris was cleaned and plastic, covering them and the walls, was removed. Pseudomorph layers were observed and excavated during the process of fill removal. HAPP sample was taken from L124.   Old loci were closed, and new ones assigned in their places. Standing mudbrick walls were taken out. The objective now has shifted to locating earlier architecture bellow the Ubaid structure or elsewhere in the trench.   Small clay figurine was excavated in L132 (KT43). It is fragmented, but details of its decoration are visible. Another small find uncovered from L134 (KT16) is a small piece of alabaster pin or applicator. Removal of fill throughout the trench continues, and the resulting excavation of artifacts is recorded; samples were collected where necessary.

We then attempted to detail this wall in Locus 119 by bringing it down to the level of the street, Locus 118. After failing to find the wall in Locus 119, we began to bring down the wall in Locus 108, attempting to define the nature and date of the wall.

This is a cluster of loci, which are located in the area of the former L142 (along the west trench baulk). They abut each other and establishing possible relations between them will be the goal during their excavation.    It appears that a large destructive event, due to fire, took place and melted mud structures (wall or oven), thus, resulting in their collapse and the accumulation of large quantity of ash and burnt debitage, i.e., burnt small rocks, pottery, lithic debitage, and ground stone tools.   L150 and L154 are ash lenses filling depressions in the hard clay surfaces (possible mud brick slumps). Both are relatively shallow (approximately 5cm) and contain various debitage: pottery, lithics, and small rocks, all show signs of burning.   From the top of L150, sherds from a small ceramic vessel was recovered, and from the top of L154, a fragmented basalt stone tool was collected (KT5).

L4101 and L4102 are both clusters resting on top of the surface L4103. The locus L4101 consisted of a pot holder made of sherds and packed into mud.      Upon further digging in L4101, we determined the locus to actually have been a pit that we pedestaled do to the pot fragment pot holder. The pit consisted almost entirely of pottery sherds with only a few non worked rocks and no bone. The pot holder itself was an orange perfectly rounded bowl of sherds packed into mud. The orange color made us believe that the pit had been heated and reheated several times.      ,~: D-4-2007-06-12 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4098,"1414,2007-06-13," D-4-2007-06-13 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4099,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   June 13, 2007      Recorder: Mila Hover (a.k.a.

At the surface, it appears packed with pot sherds, small rocks, ash, and dirt.      During the removal of the fill in L145, a small amount of metal slag was recovered and collected (KT5). Scattered around the orange melted mud brick are small round stone implements (collected in lithics bag). Few large ceramic sherds are visible on the surface, and one is leaning against L144 (mud brick wall), thus establishing context and providing clues to the depositional order in this area. At this stage of the excavation, the visible dimensions are 1.9m x 1.7m.      L153 was closed and new number assigned over the area, L158.

We made one pass with the big pick and cleaned the locus and uncovered nothing more than a continuation of the fill. We then decided to make another pass with the big pick when we uncovered a surface with reed pseudomorphs (Locus 146) and a fetus burial (Locus 145). Bradley and Barish worked on delineating the surface in Locus 146 and removing the burial in Locus 145, which appears to have been placed in a reed container. The workmen then made one pass with the big pick in Locus 142 in order to determine the depth of wall 131. While the workers completed this, Jason took down Locus 129 and uncovered a surface that was potentially the foundation surface for oven Locus 129. However, after assigning it a new Locus 147, and uncovering a concentration of lithic production tools (Lithic cores and blanks {KT 7) and two hammerstones {KT_Ñés 2 and 3), the surface probably represents a lithic work area that was sealed by the construction of the oven in Locus 129 or some other burning of the surface. The workmen then took down Locus 143 between walls 117 and 131 in order to try and find a connecting wall. Next we took down Locus 144 in hopes of finding a connection between wall 139 and wall131.

The wall seems to have slump on both sides, so we are currently going down in the surrounding loci and trying to articulate the features. Another possible wall is emerging running north to south in the southeast corner of the trench almost parallel with the bulk. I am also thinking that these features might somehow be related to the platform in D8 that currently is about 12cm below where we are.      Further excavation actually determined L4108 not to be a wall at all, but rather part of a collapsed wall that spans 4106, 4107, and 4108. This collapse appears to be from the wall I previously mentioned running along the bulk. We spent the rest of the day trying to articulate the rest of this collapse.

Butler   E. Clark      As we began excavation this season, we continued in all of the main areas excavated last week. No locus has changed shape dramatically, and thus many are indeed still open. The large area north of wall L157 had the most interesting occurrences. Last season it was concluded that this area was an outdoor work surface whose purpose continued for many years since its only change was a series of surfaces discovered as excavation moved lower. More surfaces were discovered this week. The surface L164, discovered last week, was removed, uncovering material rich in bone, lithic, and many Ubaid potsherds. Its end revealed a layer of fill, L166, identified as such by an absence of flat laying sherds and pebbles as well as a sharp decline in artifact recovery from the surface above it. We removed 5cm of this fill and quickly realized that we had discovered a new surface, L168. Additionally, during the removal of L166 we found that the southeast corner of the locus directly abutting the eastern baulk and the north side of wall L157 had become extremely ashy and produced many burned artifacts, particularly bone and lithic. This area was extremely different from the surface L168 that it abutted once we completed L166 _ÑÐ the pebbles and flat sherds from L168 did not continue here. Thus this area became L167. The surface also clearly did not extend into L159, the locus in the northeast corner of the trench, and so we continued to excavate this locus separately. We took a HAP sample from L168 after articulating the surface, and then removed the locus.      Immediately after the removal of L168 we found a new surface, L169. Our excavation of L168 had only included about 5cm and we stopped when we had taken out all of what we thought were the concentration of artifacts within the surface, but the next day a new surface was clear. The fill between the two surfaces, then, must have been extremely thin and we removed it with L168 because it blended in so smoothly with the large abundance of material and surface. Again, this new surface did not extend to L159 and L167, and so these continued with separate excavation. We took a HAP sample from L169 and then removed the locus. At the bottom of the surface, all pebbles, flat sherds, and artifacts of L169 had disappeared and this time we had clearly reached a fill locus, which we designated L170. In both surfaces L168 and L169 we encountered multiple pieces of charcoal, which we took as carbon samples for radiocarbon dating. They will hopefully establish a good timeline for these surfaces and the trench as a whole.       This week we also made new discoveries about wall L157. In L158, the locus in the southwest corner of the trench bordered by the southern and western baulk and the south side of the cell formed by L157, we removed the dirt that was still attached to the wall. We wanted to see if we were indeed under the wall as we expected. We removed the dirt until we found the bricks of the wall, and discovered that the bottom of the wall is nowhere in sight. We could see 6 courses of bricks, and a scrape at the bottom promised that there would be more. We assumed that this was the case for the entire wall, and to keep the bricks elsewhere preserved we did not reveal the rest of the wall. On the north side of the wall we removed some of the dirt at the beginning of the week, L165. This locus was equal to any locus that had abutted the wall and wasn_Ñét removed completely, and because it was removed before the excavation of L164 it equaled L156 and L163. We did not reveal the wall until the end of the week, however, with L171, which included dirt from L156, L163, L164, L166, L167, L168, and L169. L171 revealed that the wall did not continue in the same manner as it did in the southwestern corner of the trench. We had not yet reached the bottom of the north wall of the cell, but the main extent of wall from the cell only had once shallow course. This course was laid on top of the same ashy soil as L167, which had reached as far as the cell by the time we completed L169. On the southern side of this same area of the wall, which we exposed during excavation of L160, the wall had at least three courses of brick. Possibly the earth had been extremely uneven when the wall was built, or another possibility is that the wall was expanded at a later date.       Excavation continued this week in three main loci, L158, L160, and L162; we continued to excavated them simultaneously with the main surfaces L168 and L169 in order to keep things level. L158 produced nothing more significant than an increase in artifacts and a few bricks close to the southern baulk. In L160, bricks were found that extended south from wall L157, but not farther than one brick. Possibly this was apart of a cell wall that was not preserved more than this. In L162 of the northwest corner of the trench we discovered new architecture: a row of bricks in the southern area of the locus right between the western baulk and wall L157 that either goes under wall L157 or is attached to it in some fashion, and a row of stones just north of and parallel to the bricks that go right up against the wall and possibly continue under it. The bricks are not yet floating. We will have to remove the wall in order to learn more about this architecture, and whether it goes with the wall or is earlier. The bricks became L175 and the remainder of L162 became L173. Additionally, we continued excavating L59, which never became surfacey and continued with the same, and L167. L167 produced many burned finds, and its borders were constantly changing, expanding, and leaking into the areas around it, meaning that at any one point we could have designated dirt incorrectly and thus some artifacts from the surfaces could belong to this locus or vice versa.       Finally, we began excavation within the cell formed by wall L157 this week. We particularly wanted to reach the bottom of the walls here so we could prepare to remove it next week as well as see if the architecture of L173 and L175 continues under the wall. We intended to bring everything down to the level of the pit where an adult woman skeleton was found last season. In the northwest side of the cell, however, we found another human skeleton. This most likely belonged to a child since the bones were small, and was possibly associated with the woman found in the cell last season. It was not contained in anything, and was so badly preserved that many of its bones were apart of the dirt. It was laid on its side on top of a brick layer, and bricks were laid on top of him. Both brick layers followed the course of the cell wall.        ,~: E-2-2007-06-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2,"1418,2007-06-14," D-8-2007-06-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 8,","   Daily Trench    Area D   Trench 8   June 14, 2007      Recorder: Mila Hover (a.k.a.

In L145, the area of the collapsed kiln, fill is removed by excavating carefully around the orange material in order to determine dimensions of the feature. The fill from inside will be excavated for contents in sections, i.e., NE, SE, SW, and NW.    Large quantities of slag is being collected from the vitrified mud brick, which is not a sign of metal production, but rather significant about the contents of the material used in the construction of the kiln/oven. The NE section yields pottery sherds and bone. Large pot sherds in this section lean against the mud brick wall located just north of the kiln (L144). This section will be removed horizontally, in order to enable us to better understand the depositional order of artifacts. Rim sherds from different vessels are found on top of the pile of sherds, as well as throughout. Also present are ground stone implements.   The surface bellow the melted kiln reveals ashy stains and burnt orange lumps of melted mud brick.    In L158, toward the south end of the locus, a stone gathering appeared. It consists of ground stone tools, fragments of ground stone tools, and unmodified rocks. Possible collapsed mud brick wall protrudes from the south trench baulk. Underneath it is an ash layer. The raised are measures 0.9m x 0.7m, h0.06m. The wall-like formation measures 1.10m x 0.25m, h0.15m. Its south edge is contained within the south baulk.

Locus 146 is a floor surface that contains reed and grass pseudomorphs, and contained the fetus burial (Locus 145). Upon removing the surface we uncovered a plaster layer, of which there may have been more than one layer, however, we were unable to distinguish multiple plastering episodes. We then began to take down Locus 148 below Locus 146 in the hopes of finding architecture associated with the floor surface. Barish and I then began to define the burned surface in the northwest corner of the trench (Locus 152). After removing the burned surface we began to take down the wall in Locus 117 after determining that it did not connect to wall 131 and that we were coming down on a fill layer below it. While we completed that Shawash and Ur took down locus 150 on the east side of wall 131 with the big pick. Next we removed Locus 149 to the west of wall 131, which allowed us to discover that wall 131 was no longer connected to the Loci around it. While Barish and I removed wall 131 the workers removed locus 151 in the northern third of the trench. We then created Locus 153 for the fill below 131 and removed it. After cleaning the trench we began Locus 154 in the northern portion of the trench. There we discovered a pot burial (Locus 155) in the northeast corner of the trench. We began to remove the pot on the surface, being careful not to destroy the unbaked clay vessel in which the burial was sitting. After determining that the burial did in fact contain a fetus we wrapped up for the day, leaving the burial to be removed on Saturday.      ,~: D-6-2007-06-14 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 117,"1420,2007-06-14," D-4-2007-06-014-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4,","   Weekly Summary 2    06/09/2007-06/14/2007      During this week, the recovery of ground stone continues in trench D8. They are usually found in concentrations, although single whole or fragmented ones are found in association with river rocks or isolated in the fill. In L140, located in the NE corner of the trench, an ash pit was discovered and excavated. Portions of it are contained within the north and east baulks. Mud brick walls protrude from the north and east baulks to form a cell in the NE trench corner. They were investigated for possible connection with known structure and plastered wall bellow the later Ubaid cell wall (now removed).      More pseudomorph layers were revealed and samples taken. The location of melted oven/kiln (L145) was first established. It appeared as an ash pit with bright orange clay or melted brick, fused with slag substance (vitrified mud brick). When excavated later, it yielded large quantities of potter sherds (possibly multiple vessels, because of the presence of rims and the different thickness of the pottery walls).   An area of mud brick collapse was discovered in the west part of the trench. It is associated with an ash layer which surrounds it and fills the depressions. Bone, shell, pottery, and lithics are recovered from it. Small circular midden, partially contained within the north baulk excavated and recorded.      No architecture is visible at the present, except for the wall near the north baulk (L144), which is cut by the ash pit (L140) in the NE corner of the trench.

Our primary goal this week was to bring the trench down to the top of the Ubaid structure in the baulk in D8, nearly another meter. In doing this we discovered two walls in the center of the trench, Locus 117 emerging out of the western baulk and Locus 131 running through the center of the trench. The majority of the week was spent attempting to define these to walls and in finding associated architecture that might connect them. In our fill Locus 141, we discovered a floor surface (Locus 146), which contained a basket fetus burial (Locus 145). In the NW corner we uncovered a burned surface (Locus 129), which was surrounded by what appeared to be highly ed bricks. The surface was roughly ovular suggesting that it may have been an oven. Below surface Locus 129, we discovered a large lithic concentration containing two hammerstones (locus 147 KT 2 and KT 3), a large lithic core and a lithic blank (locus 147 KT 7) and numerous other items of lithic production debris and ceramics. Below this surface was another roughly ovular burnt surface (locus 152).

Since we are finding a higher concentration of this material under the larger bricks above, it leads us to believe that the ceiling caved in, followed by the wall collapsing.              ,~: D-4-2007-06-18 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4104,"1429,2007-06-18," D-6-2007-06-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 159,","         June 18, 2007    Area D, Trench 6   Barish UZEL          Today, we excavated Locus 158 fill area.

This top layer was from collapsed wall. Underneath of the large mud brick was a layer of roofing material of thin burned packed mud with reed material stuck to it. This shows that the fire caused the roof to cave in and then the walls collapsed on top of it.      The current layer we are in is right below / in the roof collapse coming onto the surface. There are scattered components of architecture spread around from the roof. Smashed pottery and sherds are pressed up against a surface type material that is collapsed at various angles. We are not yet sure of this being the floor or not, but it could be a surface smashed down into a cell and hence the sloping angles?      The bricks in the collapse layer were also turning up white chaffy stuff in between which means that either the bricks had inclusions or straw / stuff in between the bricks.      Today we also made a distinction between the top ashy layer of collapse (L4111) and the red brick burned with organic material (L4112) that we are thinking is above a surface. This locus got somewhat mixed in with the 4111 locus however, as we only made the decision to make this distinction today.      We came down on a white layer that we initially though was a floor and switched to locus L4113. However, we got sherds both over and under the layer so we are now fairly certain that it was not a floor, but possibly plaster from the wall.      From one of the architectural pieces we found, we measured the diameter of that specific roof beam to be about 6cm.        ,~: D-4-2007-06-19 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4104,"1431,2007-06-19," D-6-2007-06-20 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 159,","            June 19, 2007    Area D, Trench 6   Barish UZEL       Today, we intensified L162 area and around the locus.

L4112 today is revealing ashy fill with the same white organic material visible yesterday, however, there is very little brick material showing up in the locus still.      Towards the end of the morning, Bradley found the remnants of a textile mat laying flat in the SW corner of L4112. He followed it and believes he found the surface.      Afternoon session:      Cat, Bradley and I went out again in the afternoon and continued excavating out from the mat that Bradley had found. This in turn led to the discovery of the floor under the collapse. We spent the rest of the afternoon tracing this floor.

The large pottery sherds from the kiln appear to lean against the mud brick wall (L144). Areas with large ground stones were uncovered near the south baulk and in the east half of trench. A large storage vessel was found partially contained in the south baulk on the territory of L143. In order to excavate it, the baulk was extended by 0.6m. It appeared whole, although fragmented. It was suspected that it may contain a burial. It did not; however, the pieces of the vessel were recovered, and sample from the dirt associated with it was collected. Possible residue of the contents of the vessel are visible on the inside surface.    A rectangular-shaped shallow storage bin or pit (L159) was located near the west baulk. Its west edge is contained within the baulk. It was excavated, and sample was taken from the fill. Its bottom was covered with a white organic matter.    In L148, a ground stone concentration and cores were excavated from a single area. A large door socket or overused stone bowl was found as part of this formation. It was broken in half, but later, the other part was located near by. Near it, a single black stone (onyx) button or very small spindle with a hole in the center was recovered (KT24).       Human fetus burial was found on the border of L145 and L148. It was placed in an unlined, dirt pit, and possibly wrapped in cloth (very thin white fibers visible under the bones). Bones were in anatomical order, however, very ed. The remains were collected.       At this point, it appears that the entire exposed area of the trench belongs to a continuous work surface. There are multiple areas of white pseudomorph reed impressions throughout the trench. Ground stones and stone implements were found in all loci, usually in association with lithics, bone, and pottery. Occasionally, ash and grain impressions are found and recorded.    At the end of this week, a decision regarding the continuation of excavation of this trench will be made. It would be based on the presence of architectural features found. On the last day of this work week, a decision was made to stop excavating in D8 and to allow for more intense excavation in the near by D5, located west and up from this trench.

By the end of the week it became apparent that the area to the north of the wall (Loci 162, 164, and 167) represented the burnt mudbrick collapse layer uncovered in Trench D4, suggesting that Locus 159 represented the southern wall for that building. In the southern portion of the trench we uncovered an oven (Locus 166) and the oven_Ñés foundation (Locus 169, which was characterized by a burned layer of soil on top of a layer of cobbles and potsherds.

Clark   K. Butler         Workmen: Arif, Turgut, Sidik         Our goal for the first half of the day was to complete a plan of walls L184, L185, and L187. These are an earlier phase of L157, which has already been planned, so this plan was then completed in order to have a record of the entire lifespan of the house. While we planned we also continued to work in the trench extension, which is now almost level with the rest of the trench. In L178, a lot of mudbrick slump has been found. Likely this is from the wall that has dominated the trench, specifically the bit of wall in the extension itself, or it could also be from years of erosion down the hill. Since this mudbrick has formed nothing noticeable or substantial and it doesn_Ñét continue in any order and appears to be just slump, we have continued to dig through it. Most digging in this area is conducted with a pick. At the end of the day a scrape showed mudbrick in the northeast corner of the extension that lines up with the top of yesterday_Ñés new wall that we can see in L160.       The rest of the day was spent removing wall L184 and L185. Yesterday we did indeed discover that we were underneath the walls in all areas, indicating that we needed to go below them in order to see what_Ñés going on earlier in the trench. We scraped it all down to the levels that were on either side of the walls so we could see the earlier architecture that_Ñés appearing in these levels as a whole. In L185 specifically, we removed most of the bricks just down to the level of the last brick because we don_Ñét yet know what is under them. We also decided to not yet remove L187 because these bricks are much lower by at least 10cm than the bottom of the other walls and thus seem to be possibly a different structure.                     ,~: E-2-2007-06-23 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area E/Trench 2/Locus 158,"1439,2007-06-23," D-6-2007-06-24 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 159,","   June 23, 2007   Area D   Trench 6   Jason Kennedy and Barish Uzel      Today we began by cleaning the trench and taking opening elevations.

In Locus 168 three workers were working to uncover a surface (Locus 171) emerging along the western baulk that may connect to wall Locus 159 and represent an outdoor work surface associated with the building north of Wall 159.

After discovering a possible surface in Locus 167 we began to attempt to define that surface in the eastern half of the trench once the baulk was sufficiently removed. We unfortunately appeared to have gone below the floor in the center of Locus 167, but will proceed into the eastern third of the locus to attempt to discover the floor in the portion closed by baulk cleaning. I then removed Locus 169 in the southern third of the trench to determine its depth. Locus 169 represents a possible oven foundation and was only ca. 5 cm in depth and revealed an extension of the fill in Locus 168 below it. We then cleaned the trench and photographed.

In 4122, I revisited the pit 4123 because we had left part of it undug, as it ended up going down in a bell shape under 4122. After tracing it quite a ways under 4122, we decided to stop digging it as a pit and go down over it in 4122. We think that it may have actually been a stockpile of wood or reeds that burned or maybe more material that fell in off the roof. The pit that we dug ended at a surface and was far more ashy than any other part of the collapse we have dug.      L4123 revealed a burial (L4128) of a young child of about 5 yrs old. We know this, because we could see new teeth in the jaw coming in under baby teeth. The burial is very poorly preserved however, and all the bones are literally coming out in flakes for Bradley.      In L4127, along the West side of wall L4118, I found a pot submerged below a surface. The pot is located immediately south of the wall L4119. The pot originally appeared to be a flat small pot smashed by a rock, however, upon further excavation, I pulled up the rock to find it sealing a complete submerged storage vessel. The surface under 4127 runs right up to the rim of the vessel showing that it was buried into the floor. Also, the fact that a giant rock landed in the pot_Ñés opening without smashing it shows that it had a great deal of support around it. Inside the pot was a smaller pot that may have either fallen in or acted as a scooper within the pot. The large pot itself was relatively empty save some soil and possibly small bone fragments inside. Bradley predicts that if we were to go into the baulk, we would find a whole row of these in some sort of storage room.      ,~: D-4-2007-06-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4110,"1450,2007-06-28," D-4-2007-06-028-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4,","   June 28, 2007   Area D   Trench 6   Jason Kennedy and Barish Uzel      Today we began by removing the stonewall in Locus 170 after noticing an ashy layer below the locus after removing Locus 178 between Locus 170 and the wall in Locus 159. This layer of ash suggested that wall 170 was of a later date than the house structure represented by wall Locus 159. While the workmen removed the wall, Barish and myself worked on removing the floor of the house (Locus 172) in hopes of uncovering an earlier floor. After about 10 cm we discovered a layer of slightly ashy compact soil with a few flat lying artifacts that should represent an earlier floor of the house. We also had the workmen attempt to articulate that floor in the house extension (Locus179). After completing the removal of Locus 170 we began the removal of the mudbrick wall (locus 181) in front of the retaining wall of Locus 170. The wall was highly eroded and no rows or courses were visible during removal. After completing that we removed the fill left below locus 170 in the southern portion of the trench (Locus 183) in hopes of uncovering an extension of the earlier stonewall present under Locus 170, which was given Locus 182. Unfortunately some of the stones for the underlying stone locus 182 may have been removed in the initial removal of Locus 170. We also noted that the pit in Locus 174 was probably lined with stones, most of which were removed as assumed stonewall collapse.     ,~: D-6-2007-06-28 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 159,"1451,2007-06-28," D-4-2007-06-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4110,","   6/23/2007 _ÑÐ 6/28/2007   Weekly Summary 4   Area D Trench 6   Jason Kennedy and Barish Uzel      The primary focus of this week was to gain a better understanding of the collapsed room in the northern portion of the trench. On the 23rd, Barish, Resul, and myself worked on removing the collapsed mudbrick from Locus 167 revealing numerous small finds (including 3 spindle whorls [KTs 38, 39, and 40], 3 pieces of body adornment [KTs 41, 46, and 47], and a seal impression [KT 45]). On the 24th we continued to remove the collapse and came upon the floor (Locus 172) with a substantial number of flat lying artifacts. Outside the house we discovered several potential related features in the trench including a burnt surface (Locus 171), a large stone lined pit (Locus 174) and an outdoor work surface to the south of the pit (Locus 173). The remainder of the week was spent in attempting to remove the eastern baulk to expand the trench in order to better understand the connections of the collapsed house to the wall discovered running through D8 and D5 in previous seasons. After removing the eastern baulk we discovered a connected room with a doorway in which the collapsed layer was given Locus 177 and Locus 179. Our emphasis was the articulation of this room and preparing for plan photographs to show their connections. Of interest was the large stonewall uncovered in the baulk extension (Locus 170). This wall was initially thought to have been connected to the extension of wall Locus 159 in the eastern baulk extension, but a closer look after removing the fill between Locus 159 and Locus 170 revealed that there was a substantial amount of fill and an ash layer, suggesting that Locus 170 was not associated with the collapsed house and was of a later date. The removal of Locus 170 revealed another stonewall (Locus 182) whose association with the collapsed house has yet to be determined.     ,~: D-6-2007-06-028-Weekly from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6,"1452,2007-06-28," D-6-2007-06-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 159,","   Weekly Summary    Area D   Trench 4   June 23rd _ÑÐ June 28th       This was the week of the Baulk in D4.

We didn_Ñét get too far on that this week, but initially divided the baulk extension into two loci based on 4122 containing a slight bit more of the collapse characteristics that 4121.      We also went out and straightened the North and West baulks with gave us half a meter more of trench space. Under the West baulk, we were able to trace wall 4118 all the way to the corner of the trench. We also found a surface just west of this wall with a pot submerged below the surface in the northernmost point of L4127.      Under the west baulk, we were able to define the wall 4119 better and really determine that the area between that wall and 4116 was a storage place.

The walls that form the corner are L4110 and L4116. The collapse came out easily and we made it a part of the L4111 collapse locus. The wall 4110 also revealed a window and/or crawl space going into the next room. The window was 70cm wide and about 200 cm from the South baulk. The ledge shows wear and a curved edge, ass if it was used as a seat or repeatedly crossed through.      Necat continued working in 4126 and 4120. We tried to have him remove the submerged pot found in the northernmost corner of L4127, but he found the remains of a wall that we had missed (possibly just a continuation of wall (L4118) that acted as a cross wall between the pot area of 4127 and L4126. We missed a good portion of it though and we decided to revisit it if we have time.      Bradley finished the burial L4128 and worked the rest of the day in the collapse L4129, which later became L4134.      In the afternoon, I cleared off the collapsed fill on the east side of wall 4110 and found what I later recognized as wall L4135. There was a clear difference between the burnt material on wall 4110 North of this new wall and the composition of the material South of this wall. The fire was clearly contained to the room with surface L4134 and the large room with the 4115 surface.     ,~: D-4-2007-06-30 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4/Locus 4110,"1454,2007-06-30," D-6-2007-07-01 from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 6/Locus 159,","   June 30, 2007   Area D   Trench 6   Jason Kennedy and Barish Uzel      Today we began by cleaning the trench for opening photographs. The workmen removed stone wall Locus 182, uncovering an earlier stone concentration on the same level as the stones running up against wall Locus 159 in Locus 178 and also on the same level as the rocks that initially lined pit Locus 174, just to the west of wall Locus 182. This wall was given Locus 188. Melek and Barish worked on HAP_Ñéing the floors in Locus 185 (the room in the baulk extension) and Locus 184 (the floor of the central room). After completing the HAPs, Melek and Barish went down in Floor Locus 184 in hopes of finding an earlier floor, which was uncovered and articulated, but was not assigned a locus. I worked in Locus 185 attempting to articulate an earlier floor in the room in the eastern baulk extension. An earlier floor was found approximately 10 cm below the HAP_Ñéed floor in Locus 185. We then removed the fill below Locus 182 in the southeast corner of the trench (Locus 187), where we discovered a figurine from unstratified contexts (KT 4). A bone ring was discovered in the articulate the earlier stone wall (locus 188). We then had the workers remove the fill between the wall Locus 159 and surface Locus 171, labeled Locus 186.

We found an orange material under the collapse layer (4134) and initially decided that this was the floor. However, we reconsidered this as the surface was very soft and silty. At the end of the day, Bradley began removing this layer and we again reconsidered thinking that this may in fact have been the floor and it was just extremely burnt.      The wall L4135 was defined and I made the area south of it into L4136.      The northernmost area of the baulk extension (L4121) got a little messed up. We originally defined it as a wall (L4131) running North to South down the center of the locus and dug it as such. However, the L4131 locus that we though was the wall turned out to be collapse running through what appears to be two parallel walls (L4139 and L4140).

Multiple surfaces were not discovered, but a stone and potsherd foundation was uncovered in the southwest of the locus, which yielded three possible pieces of metal (KT 4 and KT 6). Next Melek and I began to remove and Hap the surfaces in Locus 189 and Locus 190. Upon removing the surfaces and discovering an earlier surface in Locus 189 (given Locus 192), Bradley noticed that both surfaces were well below the wall in Locus 159 meaning that only surfaces Locus 172, Locus 184, and Locus 185 were associated with the collapsed house and that surfaces Loci189, 190, and 192 were most likely earlier outdoor work surfaces that the house was built upon. After removing Locus 171 we had the workers remove Locus 186 in front of the wall in order to help determine its depth. Under surface Locus 190 in the baulk extension we discovered a large brick lined pit running into trench D4, which has become Locus 191.

This is on the Southern slope of the main mound of Kenan Tepe. The reasoning behind this placement was to capture views of the continuations of surface and architecture found in D4 during the 2001 season. The trench was excavated again in the 2005 field season in order to complete the excavations of the 2nd millennium furnace complex in the northwest portion of the trench. The purpose of the excavations in D6 this season were to attempt to discern any connections between the Ubaid walls discovered in trenches D8 and D5 and possible associated architecture in trench D6.      Excavation Notes      The trench had not been excavated in two seasons and a significant amount of erosion had fallen into the trench. Our initial starting elevations for the cleaning locus (Locus 83) was 590.01 meters above sea level, accumulating nearly .4 m of deposits above the plastic used to preserve the levels from the 2005 season. The erosion had also expanded our trench to its dimensions of 9.25 meters by 4 meters. Our initial task was to remove the erosional deposits to uncover the remains unearthed in 2005. After cleaning we began excavating beginning with Locus number 84. We began by emphasizing the Middle Bronze age pebble cobble street surfaces that more or less ran roughly north to south through the center of the trench. We uncovered at least seven different layering phases of this surface including Loci 85, 91, 96, 102, 106, 113 and118, combining for roughly .9 meters of deposit. These surfaces were composed of pebbles, cobbles, and a substantial amount of potsherds.    To the west of this street we found only one potential architectural structure, a2.1 meters long and .5 meters wide stonewall (Locus 108) which was cut by pit Locus 101, and runs into the northern baulk of the trench. The remaining Middle Bronze Loci (86, 92, and 97, and 103) yielded no associated architecture. Of note is that Ubaid painted ceramics began emerging mixed with Middle Bronze ceramics in Locus 97, and that Loci 107, 114, 120, 121, 122 all yielded primarily Ubaid ceramics.   To the east of the streets we discovered mixed contexts pretty much throughout our excavations suggesting that this portion of the trench had been heavily altered by slope erosion. The stonewall uncovered at the end of the 2005 season (Locus 73) was renamed Locus 87 and was the only significant architecture associated with the second millennium streets that we discovered. Locus 91 of the streets probably lay under any associated structure with Locus 87 in that two streets combined to form a junction with main street running north to south through the trench and a cross street joining it running east towards the Tigris. Loci 89, 90, 88, 93, 94, 95, 99, 100, 104, 105, 109, 110, 115, and 119 all contained mixed contexts and different soil consistencies that the western portion of the trench suggesting that these loci were affected by the erosional processes of the mound. An earlier stonewall foundation was discovered in Locus 112 running along the eastern border of street Locus 113, but no connecting walls were discovered as it ran both into the eastern and southern baulks.    Below the Middle Bronze street deposits and their associated loci, we uncovered largely Ubaid contexts throughout the trench. The later Ubaid deposits in the trench consisted of largely ephemeral outdoor surfaces, and we only uncovered two walls (Locus 117 and Locus 131) that ran roughly parallel to each other. Locus 117 was a mudbrick wall 3.3 meters long and .55 meters wide roughly north to south along the western baulk of the trench and was either cut or ran up against an oven or fireplace represented by Loci (124, 129, and 147). Locus 131 was a 3.5-meter long and .6 meter wide mudbrick wall with 2 discernable rows of bricks of 20 by 50 cm, however only one course of bricks was present. No connecting walls were discovered between these two walls. Below these walls lay roughly .35 meters of fill with no architectural features, however two fetus burials were discovered Locus 145 and Locus 155.    In the northern portion of the trench we discovered wall Locus 159 which provided the connection with the house structure that had been uncovered in D8 and D5 in previous seasons. To the north of wall Locus 159 we uncovered a layer of collapsed and burnt mudbrick (Locus 167). This was most likely created by the collapse of the roof followed by the collapse inward of the mudbrick wall sealing the floors (Locus 172 and Locus 184). The collapsed layer in Locus 167 contained several small finds including whole pots, tools, and body adornment, suggesting either that these items were on the roof of the building or located in some manner on the inner walls of the building.    After uncovering the floor of the house (Locus 172) we began removing the eastern baulk of the trench to ascertain the specific connections between our wall Locus 159 and the walls in Trench D8 and Trench D5, as well as the remainder of the collapsed building located and uncovered this season in Trench D4. In the eastern baulk extension we uncovered an eastern room of the house that contained a doorway into the main room represented by Floor Locus 172 and a doorway into the courtyard represented in Loci 178, 186, 180, 171, 193, 174, and 173. Wall Locus 159 extended into the eastern baulk and came to a corner and became the same wall discovered earlier in trenches D8 and D5.    A large stonewall of unknown date (Locus 170) and an earlier foundation or wall (Locus 182) was discovered in the eastern baulk extension as well. Both Ubaid and Early Bronze age diagnostic pottery was uncovered in the removal of both portions of the wall. An earlier wall was discovered in Locus 188 that was Ubaid in date and abutted the southeast corner of Wall Locus 159. Locus 188 probably represents a courtyard or terrace wall associated with the collapsed house. A doorway into this courtyard was discovered in the room in the eastern baulk extension. In the courtyard were a number of features. A burnt surface (Locus 171) with a rock and potsherd foundation (Locus 193) was located along the western baulk in the center of the trench. A large stone lined pit (Locus 174) abutted the stone courtyard wall of Locus 188, and was tentatively dated to be Ubaid based on ceramic typology. A surface (Locus 173) was located directly to the west of the pit and contained some small cobbles, potsherds, and a significant amount of ash and charred seeds.   Below the floors of both the rooms and located below the foundation of Wall Locus 159 we discovered a series of surfaces (Loci 189, 190, 192) that probably represented earlier Ubaid outdoor work surfaces. A large pit (Locus 191) was discovered in the eastern room in the baulk extension that ran below the wall and into the northern baulk between D6 and D4. This pit was filled with burnt earth and ash, and revealed a hard burnt earth surface suggesting that it was an earlier Ubaid hearth associated with the outdoor work surfaces in Loci 189, 190, and 192.

Middle Bronze occupations with at least 7 different levels of the street.    Late Chalcolithic 1 occupation identified by ceramic finds and ephemeral architecture    Early Northern Ubaid _ÑÐ represented by the collapsed house and associated courtyard features    An earlier more ephemeral Ubaid occupation below the collapsed house represented by outdoor work surfaces and a potential hearth.             The Middle Bronze layers are represented by the Loci 84 to 118, with a few exceptions in the northwest portion of the trench (Loci 107 and 114). There were seven distinct levels for the Middle Bronze street however architecture to the east of the wall most likely would have been removed by slope erosion, which is supported by the mixed contexts and soil differences in much of the eastern portion of the trench in the Middle Bronze deposits. Only the stonewall foundations of Locus 87 and 112 provide any evidence for architecture along the streets in the Middle Bronze period.   The Late Chalcolithic occupation is discerned best as the two parallel walls in Locus 117 and Locus 131 in which no connecting architectural remains were uncovered, and by the burnt surface in Locus 124 and 129, as well as the lithic concentration below them in Locus 147. The Late Chalcolithic 1 period is defined as Loci 120-153, with the exceptions of several loci in the extreme eastern portion of the trench that contained mixed contexts (Loci 127,134, and 137). The walls in Locus 117 and Locus 131 may have been ephemeral courtyard or outdoor walls for an associated complex elsewhere on the mound, or may have been connected but highly affected by erosional processes. One peculiar note is that the Middle Bronze streets directly sealed the LC1 deposits, with no evidence of Early Bronze occupation on this portion of the mound (with the exception of Locus 170, which may represent the foundation of the EB city wall uncovered in other trenches at the site.   The Early Northern Ubaid occupation is represented by the collapsed house and associated courtyard features found in Loci 159, 167-188, and 193. Wall Locus 159 forms the southern most wall of the house that extends into Trench D4, where the western wall runs into the baulk, suggesting that the southwestern corner of the building and the series of associated western rooms are located in the western baulk of D6. Wall Locus 159 runs east to west into the eastern baulk of D6 where it formed the southeast corner of the building and connects to the walls uncovered in Trenches D8 and D5. The collapsed house provides an unprecedented look into the life of people in the Ubaid providing evidence for both the production of clothing and the production of body adornments in the form of beads and pendants. The presence of large concentrations of burnt seeds should be able to inform us more of their subsistence and agricultural practices upon further analysis.   Finally the earliest occupation discovered in Trench D6 is Ubaid in date but with only ephemeral outdoor surfaces and one hearth in Loci 188-192. The exposure here is limited purely to the area of the collapsed house and a larger exposure may yield evidence of earlier architecture.

L4102 was a rock and pottery concentration resting on what we later realized was a thin mud packed surface (L4103) that was virtually impossible to see while digging down. L4101 was a pit containing a large concentration of sherds as well as a pot holder stand made of sherds in packed mud.      We finally started hitting some good context at the end of the first week when we came across the top of what later became the collapse layer L4111.       There was a little confusion here at the beginning before we knew what we had, so let me take a minute to explain the loci. I originally thought L4108 was the wall. Working under the assumption that L4108 was a wall, I defined L4016 and L4107 on either side. The \wall\ L4108 however ended up being just the top of the collapse layer L4111. Thus L4106, 4107, and 4108 are actually the same fill above collapse locus. I later redefined the fill above the collapse locus as L4109. The wall from which the collapse occurred is locus 4110.       The collapse layer itself (L4111) was characterized by burnt mud brick of red, yellow and green varieties. There was a thick layer of large, whole mud bricks at the top of the collapse, followed by a higher concentration of thin burned mud roofing material. There were also architectural components containing the curvature of the roofing beams _ÑÐ the diameter of the beams tended to be between 6 and 9cm from the ones that I measured.       We later switched loci from L4111 to L4112 because we noticed a change in the characteristics of the locus. This new locus contained primarily burnt red brick material and the roofing material with scattered white chaffy bits showing either a plaster between bricks or inclusions within the bricks. We also figured that we were getting close to the floor now that we were under the roofing material.       We then divided L4112 into L4112 and L4113 when we noticed a white layer that we thought was a surface that became L4113. However, when we got below it, we realized that it was not actually a change but still part of the same collapse - possibly a plaster facing from a fallen wall? We kept the distinction however, as the remaining L4112 was showing some different characteristics than that of L4113. Primarily, the remaining section of L4112 is a more ashy fill like content than the red brick material showing up in the area later separated as L4113. This showed that the collapse was higher and more concentrated by the wall 4110 than on the west side of the trench.      Under L4113 and L4112, we found the floor towards the end of the week (L4115). The floor had several small finds on it including 3 andirons, various shaped pottery, and several other hardened mudbrick items theoretically for use in an oven? One of the most interesting finds was a carved mound of hardened clay (L4113 _ÑÐ KT#47) in the shape of a cone with a rounded top delineated with a groove. Similar material was used in a solid dome mound that was found in the SW corner of 4113. I think these were used in some fashion to shape or mold material around: possibly baskets or hides. We also found several unfired shallow clay vessels that would fall apart upon excavation. A couple samples of these are L4141-KT#4 and L4112-KT#28.      One of the most important things determined from the excavation of the collapse layer was the order of collapse. Most of the large small finds towards the floor L4115 were not lying flat on the floor showing that they fell into the place that we excavated them. Theoretically then, they could have been sitting on a shelf on the wall. The way the collapse must have occurred during the fire, due to the way the architecture came up, was that the roof would have caved in first, knocking the objects to the ground below it. Hence the objects, followed by a layer of roofing material. After the roof caved in, the walls then collapsed on top creating the highly concentrated layer of solid burnt mud bricks at the top of the collapse layer we excavated.      At this point, we knocked the East baulk into D8 in order to go down and find the connection between the house in my trench and the rest of the walls in D8, D5, and D6. We initially divided the baulk extension into two loci based on 4122 containing a slight bit more of the collapse characteristics that 4121.      We also straightened the North and West baulks which gave us half a meter more of trench space. Under the West baulk, we were able to trace wall 4118 all the way to the corner of the trench. We also found a surface just west of this wall with a pot submerged below the surface in the northernmost point of L4127. We found part of a wall that we had missed jut to the west of this submerged pot (possibly an extension of L4118) and theoretically this wall was separating out a room that continues into the West baulk with multiple rows of these submerged storage pots.      Under the North baulk, we were able to define the wall 4119 better and really determine that the area between that wall and 4116 was a storage place. We were under this impression anyways, when we found the organic material slump L4117 in between these two parallel running walls (L4116 and L4119). We also found the oven 4125 up against the wall 4119.       I believe the East Baulk is the real key to the puzzle however. The room associated with surface 4134 was extremely burnt on all four walls. Also, the surface itself (4134) was so burnt, that we only recognized it as a change in material / locus and not immediately as a surface itself. Thus we ended up switching locus when we hit it, but we never took a HAP sample. The surface was extremely burnt orange, to the point of being soft and crumbly to the touch. This room was clearly a storage room of some sort, having a crawl space / window access from a whole preserved in wall 4110. This crawl space was 54cm of the ground, 70cm wide, and 75cm from the NE corner of the room associated with the 4115 surface. It is important to note that the ledge of the crawl space showed wear in the shape of a curve from repeated use both coming and going from the storage room.   This storage room (associated with the 4134 surface) contained what we originally misdefined as a pit (4123). When we first hit this \pit\ it had a rounded shape and the normal characteristics of a pit (soft, silty, ashy soil). However, as we went down, the pit ended precisely at the surface 4134 but continued out in a bell shape as we dug down _ÑÐ uncharacteristic of a pit. We now believe that this \pit\ was a pile of wood or some type of material being stored in this room.       I also believe that the fire initially started here in this storage room. It is interesting to note, that the four walls of the storage room all had signs of burn, while on the other side of wall L4110 (directly on the other side of this room) the wall had no ash. There was significant burn on the rest of that side of wall 4110 however -- just not directly on the other side of the storage room. One theory is that the fire started in the storage room causing that part of the wall 4110 to collapse into the larger room. The higher section of that part of the wall then blocked the lower half of the wall from the flames and kept it from getting burnt. And it was when that section of the wall from the storage room collapsed, that the fire the spread to the larger room and caused the roof to collapse, etc. This would also explain why, even at the lowest part of the collapse, we were still getting some mixed content of mud brick and architectural components from the roof.      The wall L4137 is the wall that connects D4, D5, D6, and D8.      The last part of the trench that requires some explanation is the North end of the East Baulk extension. We originally defined a wall (L4131) running North to South down the center of the locus (4121) and dug it as such. However, the L4131 locus that we thought was the wall turned out to be contained collapse running through what appeared to be two parallel walls (L4139 and L4140). We determined that L4131 was actually a small bin that caught the collapse that fell into this area. L4140 is a normal large wall, while L4139 was a thin wall on the west side of the bin.         ,~dc-terms:title: D-4-2007-07-05-Season from Turkey/Kenan Tepe/Area D/Trench 4,"
