This is an initial exploration of the Open Context site diaries found at

[http://opencontext.dainst.org/sets/.json?rows=2620&type=documents&start=1&response=uri][1] using David McClure's Textplot: 
[https://github.com/davidmcclure/textplot][2]

The materials from Open Context are CC-BY the original excavators.

My notes and files are at [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) which I'll be making public in due course. For the time being, this repo hosts my explorations using Textplot, which I am contrasting with other forms of 'distant reading' this corpus of materials. I'm still getting to grips with the zooming interface, to make my images big enough to support the zoom. 

You can see my [latest attempt here](http://shawngraham.github.io/Open-Context-Site-Diaries/#oc-diaries/annotated/0.1936/0.8223/2.7378). The curly braces are my attempt at indicating - roughly - the 'dimension' or rough theme that seems to be structuring the discussion in that direction. Layout is force-directed, and so in itself x & y are meaningless, but given the way Textplot makes connections between words... well, I'll probably be changing these annotations before too long anyway!
